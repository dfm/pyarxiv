	Abstract = {We compare a variety of lossless image compression methods on a large sample of astronomical images and show how the compression ratios and speeds of the algorithms are affected by the amount of noise (that is, entropy) in the images. In the ideal case where the image pixel values have a random Gaussian distribution, the equivalent number of uncompressible noise bits per pixel is given by K=0. Hcompress produces slightly better compression but at the expense of three times more CPU time than Rice. Compression tests on a sample of 32-bit integer images show similar results, but the relative speed and compression ratio advantage of Rice over GZIP is even greater. We also briefly discuss a technique for compressing floating point images that converts the pixel values to scaled integers. The image compression and uncompression utility programs used in this study (called fpack and funpack) are publicly available from the HEASARC web site. A simple command-line interface may be used to compress or uncompress any FITS image file.},

@article{Zaritsky:2010,
	Abstract = {We explore whether global observed properties, specifically half-light radii, mean surface brightness, and integrated stellar kinematics, suffice to unambiguously differentiate galaxies from star clusters, which presumably formed differently and lack dark matter halos. We find that star clusters lie on the galaxy scaling relationship referred to as the Fundamental Manifold (FM), on the extension of a sequence of compact galaxies, and so conclude that there is no simple way to differentiate star clusters from ultra-compact galaxies. By extending the validity of the FM over a larger range of parameter space and a wider set of objects, we demonstrate that the physics that constrains the resulting baryon and dark matter distributions in stellar systems is more general than previously appreciated. The generality of the FM implies 1) that the stellar spatial distribution and kinematics of one type of stellar system do not arise solely from a process particular to that set of systems, such as violent relaxation for elliptical galaxies, but are instead the result of an interplay of all processes responsible for the generic settling of baryons in gravitational potential wells, 2) that the physics of how baryons settle is independent of whether the system is embedded within a dark matter halo, and 3) that peculiar initial conditions at formation or stochastic events during evolution do not ultimately disturb the overall regularity of baryonic settling. We also utilize the relatively simple nature of star clusters to relate deviations from the FM to the age of the stellar population and find that stellar population models systematically and significantly over predict the mass-to-light ratios of old, metal-rich clusters.},

@article{Kalirai:2001,
	Abstract = {We present this paper in conjunction with a companion paper as the first results in the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Open Star Cluster Survey. This survey is a large BVR imaging data set of 19 open star clusters in our Galaxy. This data set was taken with the CFH12K mosaic CCD (42'×28'), and the majority of the clusters were imaged under excellent photometric, subarcsecond seeing, conditions. The combination of multiple exposures extending to deep (V~25) magnitudes with short (<=10 s) frames allows for studies ranging from faint white dwarf stars to bright turnoff, variable, and red giant stars. The primary aim of this survey is to catalog the white dwarf stars in these clusters and establish observational constraints on the initial-final mass relationship for these stars and the upper mass limit to white dwarf production. Additionally, we hope to better determine the properties of the clusters, such as age and distance, and also test evolution and dynamical theories by analyzing luminosity and mass functions. In order to more easily incorporate these data in further studies, we have produced a catalog of positions, magnitudes, colors, and stellarity confidence for all stars in each cluster of the survey. This reduction, along with the computed calibration parameters for all three nights of the observing run will encourage others to use these data in different astrophysical studies outside of our goals. Additionally, the data set is reduced using the new TERAPIX photometric reduction package, PSFex, which is found to compare well with other packages. This paper is intended both as a source for the astronomical community to obtain information on the clusters in the survey and as a detailed reference of reduction procedures for further publications of individual clusters. We discuss the methods employed to reduce the data and compute the photometric catalog. We reserve both the scientific results for each individual cluster and global results from the study of the entire survey for future publications. The first of these further publications is devoted to the old rich open star cluster, NGC 6819, and appears as a companion paper in the same issue of the Journal.},

@article{Pizagno:2011,
	Abstract = {A non-parametric smoothing method is presented that reduces noise in multi-wavelength imaging data sets. Using Principle Component Analysis (hereafter PCA) to associate pixels according to their $ugriz$-band colors, smoothing is done over pixels with a similar location in PCA space. This method smoothes over pixels with similar color, which reduces the amount of mixing of different colors within the smoothing region. The method is tested using a mock galaxy with signal-to-noise levels and color characteristics of SDSS data. When comparing this method to smoothing methods using a fixed radial profile or an adaptive radial profile, the chi^2-like statistic for the method presented here is smaller. The method shows a small dependence on input parameters. Running this method on SDSS data and fitting theoretical stellar population models to the smoothed data of the mock galaxy and SDSS data, shows that the method reduces scatter in the best-fit stellar population analysis parameters, when compared to cases where no smoothing is done. For an area centered on the star forming region of the mock galaxy, the median and standard deviation of the PCA-smoothed data is 7 Myr (+/- 3 Myr), as compared to 10 Myr (+/- 1 Myr) for a simple radial average, where the noise-free true value is 7.5 Myr (+/- 3.7 Myr).},

	Abstract = {Recent theoretical work suggests that it may be common for stars in the disks of spiral galaxies to migrate radially across significant distances in the disk. Such migrations are a result of resonant scattering with spiral arms and move the guiding centers of the stars while preserving the circularities of their orbits. Migration can therefore efficiently mix stars in all parts of the Galactic disk. We are rapidly approaching an important confluence of theory and observation, where we may soon be able to uncover signatures of such processes in our own Milky Way. The resolution and robustness of the physical modeling in simulations has improved drastically, while observational datasets are increasing in depth and astrometric accuracy. Here, we discuss the results from our idealized N-body/SPH simulations of disk formation and evolution, emphasizing specifically the observational consequences of stellar migration on the solar neighborhood and the vertical structure of the disk. We demonstrate that radial mixing of stars is a crucial dynamical process that we must try to understand if we are to draw significant conclusions about our Galactic history from the properties of stars in our vicinity.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the distribution of bright main sequence stars near the northern edge of the M33 disk. Clustering on sub-kpc scales is seen among stars with ages near 10 Myr, and two large star-forming complexes are identified. Similar large-scale grouping is not evident among stars with ages 100 Myr. These stars are also distributed over a much larger area than those with younger ages, and it is argued that random stellar motions alone, as opposed to orderly motions of the type spurred by large scale secular effects, can re-distribute stars out to distances of at least 2 kpc (i.e. one disk scale length) from their birth places on 100 Myr timescales. Such random motions may thus play a significant role in populating the outer regions of the M33 disk. Finally, it is suggested that - to the extent that the ambient properties of the outer disk mirror those in the main body of the disk - stars in this part of M33 may have formed in star clusters with masses 50 - 250 solar, which is substantially lower than the peak of the solar neighborhood initial cluster mass function.},

	Abstract = {We introduce a novel technique to construct spatially resolved maps of stellar mass surface density in galaxies based on optical and near-infrared (NIR) imaging. We use optical/NIR colour(s) to infer effective stellar mass-to-light ratios (M/L) at each pixel, which are then multiplied by the surface brightness to obtain the local surface stellar mass density. We build look-up tables to express M/L as a function of colour(s) by marginalizing over a Monte Carlo library of 50000 stellar population synthesis (SPS) models by Charlot & Bruzual, which include a revised prescription for the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) stellar evolutionary phase. Moreover, we incorporate a wide range of possible dust extinction parameters. In order to extract reliable flux and colour information at any position in the galaxy, we perform a median adaptive smoothing of the images that preserves the highest possible spatial resolution.  As the most practical and robust, and hence fiducial method, we express the M/L in the H band as a function of (g - i) and (i - H). Stellar mass maps computed in this way have a typical accuracy of 30 per cent or less at any given pixel, determined from the scatter in the models. We compare maps obtained with our fiducial method with those derived using other combinations of bandpasses: (i) mass maps based on the M/L in NIR bands require one optical and one optical-NIR colour to avoid significant biases as a function of the local physical properties of a galaxy; (ii) maps based on M/L in i band as a function of (g - i) only are generally in excellent agreement with our best optical-NIR set, except for extremely star-forming and dust extincted regions. We further compute stellar mass maps using a model library identical to the previous one except for being based on older SPS models, which assume shorter lived TP-AGB stars. The M/L in the NIR inferred using these old models may be up to 2.5 times larger than the new ones, but this varies strongly as a function of colours and is maximal for the bluest colours.  Finally, we compare total stellar mass estimates obtained by integrating resolved mass maps with those obtained with unresolved photometry. In galaxies with evident dust lanes, unresolved estimates may miss up to 40 per cent of the total stellar mass because dusty regions are strongly under-represented in the luminous fluxes.},

	Abstract = {The first step toward doing high-precision astrometry is the measurement of individual stars in individual images, a step that is fraught with dangers when the images are undersampled. The key to avoiding systematic positional error in undersampled images is to determine an extremely accurate point-spread function (PSF). We apply the concept of the effective PSF (ePSF) and show that in images that consist of pixels it is the ePSF, rather than the often-used instrumental PSF, that embodies the information from which accurate star positions and magnitudes can be derived. We show how, in a rich star field, one can use the information from dithered exposures to derive an extremely accurate effective PSF by iterating between the PSF itself and the star positions that we measure with it. We also give a simple but effective procedure for representing spatial variations of the Hubble Space Telescope PSF. With such attention to the PSF, we find that we are able to measure the position of a single reasonably bright star in a single image with a precision of 0.02 pixel (2 mas in WF frames, 1 mas in PC), but with a systematic accuracy better than 0.002 pixel (0.2 mas in WF, 0.1 mas in PC), so that multiple observations can reliably be combined to improve the accuracy by sqrt(N).},

	Abstract = {A new method is presented for determining the point  spread function (PSF) of images that lack bright and isolated  stars. It is based on the same principles as the MCS image  deconvolution algorithm. It uses the  information contained in all stellar images to achieve  the double task of reconstructing the PSFs for single or multiple  exposures of the same field and to extract the photometry of  all point sources in the field of view. The use of the full  information available allows us to construct an accurate PSF. The  possibility to simultaneously consider several exposures makes it  well suited to the measurement of the  light curves of blended point sources from data that would be  very difficult or even impossible to analyse with traditional PSF  fitting techniques.  The potential of the method for the  analysis of ground-based and space-based data is tested on  artificial images and illustrated by several examples, including  HST/NICMOS images of a lensed quasar and VLT/ISAAC images of  a faint blended Mira star in the halo of the giant elliptical  galaxy NGC 5128 (Cen A).},

	Abstract = {This paper describes the MegaPipe image processing pipeline at the Canadian Astronomical Data Centre. The pipeline combines multiple images from the MegaCam mosaic camera on Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) and combines them into a single output image. MegaPipe takes as input detrended MegaCam images and does a careful astrometric and photometric calibration on them. The calibrated images are then resampled and combined into image stacks. The astrometric calibration of the output images is accurate to within 0.15 relative to external reference frames and 0.04 internally. The photometric calibration is good to within 0.03 mag. The stacked images and catalogs derived from these images are available through the CADC Web site.},

@incollection{Andrieu:2004,
	Abstract = {The modern history of Monte Carlo techniques dates back from the 1940's and the Manhattan project. There are earlier descriptions of Monte Carlo experiments, Buffon's famous needle experiment is one them, but examples have been traced back to Babylonian and old testament times [13]. As we shall see these techniques are particularly useful in scenarios where it is of interest to perform calculations that involve - explicitly or implicitly - a probability distribution π on a space X (typically $\mathsf{X} \subset \mathbb{R}^{n_x}$ for some integer n x), for which closed-form calculations cannot be carried out due to the algebraic complexity of the problem. As we shall see the main principle of Monte Carlo techniques consists of replacing the algebraic representation of π, e.g. $1/\sqrt{2\pi}\exp(\frac{-1}{2}x^{2}) $ with a sample or population representation of π, e.g. a set of samples $X_{1},X_{2},\ldots,X_{N}\overset{iid}{\sim}\pi(x)=1/\sqrt{2\pi}\exp(\frac{-1}{2}x^{2})$. This proves in practice to be extremely powerful as difficult - if not impossible - exact algebraic calculations are typically replaced with simple calculations in the sample domain. One should however bear in mind that these are random approximations of the true quantity of interest. An important scenario where Monte Carlo methods can be of great help is when one is interested in evaluating expectations of functions, say f, of the type $\mathbb{E}_{\pi}\left( f(X)\right) $ where π is the probability distributions that defines the expectation. The nature of the approach, where algebraic quantities are approximated by random quantities, requires one to quantify the random fluctuations around the true desired value. As we shall see, the power of Monte Carlo techniques lies in the fact that the rate at which the approximation converges towards the true value of interest is immune to the dimension n x of the space X where π is defined. This is the second interest of Monte Carlo techniques.},

	Abstract = {Spectroscopy is one of the most important tools that an astronomer has for studying the universe. This chapter begins by discussing the basics, including the different types of optical spectrographs, with extension to the ultraviolet and the near-infrared. Emphasis is given to the fundamentals of how spectrographs are used, and the trade-offs involved in designing an observational experiment. It then covers observing and reduction techniques, noting that some of the standard practices of flat-fielding often actually degrade the quality of the data rather than improve it. Although the focus is on point sources, spatially resolved spectroscopy of extended sources is also briefly discussed. Discussion of differential extinction, the impact of crowding, multi-object techniques, optimal extractions, flat-fielding considerations, and determining radial velocities and velocity dispersions provide the spectroscopist with the fundamentals needed to obtain the best data. Finally the chapter combines the previous material by providing some examples of real-life observing experiences with several typical instruments.},

	Abstract = {One of our closest neighbours, the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) has been the subject of numerous large area studies across the entire spectrum, but so far full-disk radio surveys have been conducted only at low resolution. The new wide-field capabilities of the DiFX software correlator present the possibility of imaging the entire primary beam of a VLBI array, thus enabling a high resolution wide-field study of the entire galaxy. Using the VLBA and EVN, pilot observations of M31 have been carried out with the aim of using these new wide-field techniques to characterise the population of compact components at VLBI resolution both within and behind one of our nearest neighbours. This contribution describes the observations carried out, the preliminary processing and first results.},

	Abstract = {The evolution of AGB stars is notoriously complex. The confrontation of AGB population models with observed stellar populations is a useful alternative to the detailed study of individual stars in efforts to converge towards a reliable evolution theory. I review here the impact of studies of star clusters on AGB models and AGB population synthesis, deliberately leaving out any more complex stellar populations. Over the last 10 years, despite much effort, the absolute uncertainties in the predictions of the light emitted by intermediate age populations have not been reduced to a satisfactory level. Observational sample definitions, as well as the combination of the natural variance in AGB properties with small number statistics, are largely responsible for this situation. There is hope that the constraints may soon become strong enough, thanks to large unbiased surveys of star clusters, resolved colour-magnitude diagrams, and new analysis methods that can account for the stochastic nature of AGB populations in clusters.},

	Abstract = {We use a combination of deep optical and near-infrared light profiles for a morphologically diverse sample of Virgo cluster galaxies to homogeneously study the radially-resolved stellar populations of cluster galaxies over the full range of galaxy structure. We find that the age gradients of Virgo galaxies are predominantly positive for gas-poor spheroids (dS0, dE, E, S0), gas-poor spirals (Sa$-$Sb) and irregulars, and negative for gas-rich spirals (Scd$-$Sd), while the metallicity gradients of all galaxy types are negative. Comparing the stellar population diagnostics (age, metallicity, and gradients thereof) for our galaxies against their structural and environmental parameters also reveals that the ages of the gas-rich systems depend principally on their atomic gas deficiencies; individually, the spiral and irregular galaxy types exhibit a secondary age dependence on surface brightness and concentration, respectively. The metallicities of all Virgo galaxy types, on the other hand, universally depend on their luminosities, while those of gas-poor and irregular galaxies depend additionally on their concentrations and surface brightnesses. The stellar population gradients of all Virgo galaxies, however, exhibit no dependence on either their structure or environment. (abridged)},

	Abstract = {The tasks of the DAOPHOT program, developed to exploit the capability of photometrically linear image detectors to perform stellar photometry in crowded fields, are discussed. Raw CCD images are prepared prior to analysis, and following the obtaining of an initial star list with the FIND program, synthetic aperture photometry is performed on the detected objects with the PHOT routine. A local sky brightness and a magnitude are computed for each star in each of the specified stellar apertures, and for crowded fields, the empirical point-spread function must then be obtained for each data frame. The GROUP routine divides the star list for a given frame into optimum subgroups, and then the NSTAR routine is used to obtain photometry for all the stars in the frame by means of least- squares profile fits. The process is illustrated with images of stars in a crowded field, and shortcomings and possible improvements of the program are considered.},

	Abstract = {Between 1997 June and 2001 February the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) collected 25.4 Tbytes of raw imaging data covering 99.998% of the celestial sphere in the near-infrared J (1.25 mum), H (1.65 mum), and Ks (2.16 mum) bandpasses. Observations were conducted from two dedicated 1.3 m diameter telescopes located at Mount Hopkins, Arizona, and Cerro Tololo, Chile. The 7.8 s of integration time accumulated for each point on the sky and strict quality control yielded a 10 sigma point-source detection level of better than 15.8, 15.1, and 14.3 mag at the J, H, and Ks bands, respectively, for virtually the entire sky. Bright source extractions have 1 sigma photometric uncertainty of <0.03 mag and astrometric accuracy of order 100 mas. Calibration offsets between any two points in the sky are <0.02 mag. The 2MASS All-Sky Data Release includes 4.1 million compressed FITS images covering the entire sky, 471 million source extractions in a Point Source Catalog, and 1.6 million objects identified as extended in an Extended Source Catalog.},

In WIRCam, the wide-field infrared camera at the Canada France Hawaii Telescope, two of the four Hawaii-2RG (H2RG) HgCdTe imaging arrays in its mosaic exhibit strong persistence while the other two do not. The dependence of the persistence on illumination flux and fluence has been investigated and the persistence measured on the timescale of hundreds of milliseconds to several hours. The goal of this work is to eventually provide an empirical model to correct for the persistence in image post-processing.},

It's mosaic of four HAWAII-2RG is read using two SDSU-III controllers with 32-amplifiers in parallel per detector. First-light images showed that WIRCam suffered from three flavors of cross-talk: the "positive", "negative" and "edge" cross-talks. All have now been eliminated at the source and WIRCam is now cross-talk free. Two of these cross-talks originated from the controller electronic and one, the "edge" cross-talk, is intimately linked to the HAWAII-2RG detector and its description may be of a broader interest for other instruments using these detectors. We present the three cross-talk flavors and the hardware or software solutions implemented to eliminate them.},

	Abstract = {In the past decade, new thermal modelling tools have been offered to system designers. These modelling tools have rarely been used for the cooled instruments in ground-based astronomy. In addition to an overwhelming increase of PC computer capabilities, these tools are now mature enough to drive the design of complex astronomical instruments that are cooled. This is the case for WIRCam, the new wide-field infrared camera installed on the CFHT in Hawaii on the Mauna Kea summit. This camera uses four 2K×2K Rockwell Hawaii-2RG infrared detectors and includes 2 optical barrels and 2 filter wheels. This camera is mounted at the prime focus of the 3.6m CFHT telescope. The mass to be cooled is close to 100 kg. The camera uses a Gifford Mac-Mahon closed-cycle cryo-cooler. The capabilities of the I-deas thermal module (TMG) is demonstrated for our particular application: predicted performances are presented and compared to real measurements after integration on the telescope in December 2004. In addition, we present thermal modelling of small Peltier cooled CCD packages, including the thermal model of the CCD220 Peltier package (fabricated by e2v technologies) and cold head. ESO and the OPTICON European network have funded e2v technologies to develop a compact packaged Peltier-cooled 8-output back illuminated L3Vision CCD. The device will achieve sub-electron read-noise at frame rates up to 1.5 kHz. The development, fully dedicated to the latest generation of adaptive optics wavefront sensors, has many unique features. Among them, the ultra-compactness offered by a Peltier package integrated in a small cold head including the detector drive electronics, is a way to achieve amazing performances for adaptive optics systems. All these models were carried out using a normal PC laptop.},

	Abstract = {CFHTs experience with interlacing science and guide pixel readout using the Hawaii-2RG infrared sensors on WIRCam has been problematic due to timing limitations inherent to this approach as well as unexpected behaviour in the sensors themselves. These problems have been overcome by implementing high-speed readout (1.4 s per read) for WIRCam's array of four Hawaii-2RG sensors, obviating the need for interlaced readout. The effect of the reset anomaly on the science and guide frames has been minimized by introducing suitable delays and a clocking scheme that does not significantly impact the minimum exposure time of the camera.},

	Abstract = {WIRCam (Wide-field InfraRed Camera) is a near-infrared (0.9-2.4 microns) camera developed for the prime focus of the Canada France Hawaii Telescope (CFHT), a 3.6-m telescope located on Mauna Kea, Hawaii. WIRCam is based on 4 x 2048x2048 HAWAII2RG arrays, developed by Rockwell. The camera provides a 0.3"/pixel sampling, and the close packaging of the detectors allows to cover an almost contiguous field-of-view of 20.5' x 20.5'. All optical elements are assembled in a cryovessel and cooled down to 85K by a He closed cycle cryogenerator. The two filter wheels have capacity for 8 filters (110 mm in diameter), cooled at low temperature together with the Lyot stop. These wheels are mounted on sapphire ball bearings and powered by external motors. Passive spring indexers define their positioning. A fused-silica tip/tilt plate powered by voice coil type motors provides image stabilization in front of the cryovessel. It compensates for flexures as well as for low frequency telescope oscillations from wind shake. This paper describes the overall architecture of the camera, giving the optical estimated performances and details some specific points of the design such as filter wheels, thermal connections, etc..},

	Abstract = {We present the largest galaxies as seen in the near-infrared (1-2 mum), imaged with the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS), ranging in angular size from 1' to 1.5d. We highlight the 100 largest in the sample. The galaxies span all Hubble morphological types, including elliptical galaxies, normal and barred spirals, and dwarf and peculiar classes. The 2MASS Large Galaxy Atlas provides the necessary sensitivity and angular resolution to examine in detail morphologies in the near-infrared, which may be radically different from those in the optical. Internal structures such as spirals, bulges, warps, rings, bars, and star formation regions are resolved by 2MASS. In addition to large mosaic images, the atlas includes astrometric, photometric, and shape global measurements for each galaxy. A comparison of fundamental measures (e.g., surface brightness, Hubble type) is carried out for the sample and compared with the Third Reference Catalogue. We further showcase NGC 253 and M51 (NGC 5194/5195) to demonstrate the quality and depth of the data. The atlas represents the first uniform, all-sky, dust-penetrated view of galaxies of every type, as seen in the near-infrared wavelength window that is most sensitive to the dominant mass component of galaxies. The images and catalogs are available through the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database and Infrared Science Archive and are part of the 2MASS Extended Source Catalog.},

	Abstract = {Quantitative information about variations in the background at J and K' are presented and used to develop guidelines for the acquisition and reduction of ground-based images of faint extended sources in the near-infrared, especially those that occupy a significant fraction of the field of view of a detector or that are located in areas crowded with foreground or background sources. Findings are based primarily on data acquired over three photometric nights with the 3.6m×3.6m CFHT-IR array on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) atop Mauna Kea. Although some results are specific to CFHT, overall conclusions should be useful in guiding observing and reduction strategies of extended objects elsewhere. During the run, the mean brightness of the background (more than 70% of which was from the sky) varied significantly on a very short timescale: by 0.7% per minute in J and 0.5% per minute in K', on average. Changes in the optical depth of the sky were partly responsible, because stars faded as the background level increased. A changing pattern in the background was evident from differences of consecutive pairs of frames (0.3% per minute in J and 0.2% per minute in K'), but this originated primarily in the instrumentation. Any pattern over 3.6m associated with the atmosphere changed at a rate less than about 0.06% per minute in K' relative to the signal from the sky alone. To measure the background to a precision of 1% per frame, exposures of extended targets should be alternated with identical exposures of the background. In J and K', target and sky exposures ought to be separated by no more than 90 and 130 s, respectively. To observe a target larger than about 40% of the field of view, background samples ought to be taken with the target shifted completely out of the field. For smaller targets, gains in efficiency can be made by shifting the target to a different place on the array. The signal-to-noise ratio of the reduced image of a target is maximized by evaluating the background for each individual image using only the samples taken immediately before and after. Provided background images are dithered, it is possible to recognize and remove celestial contaminants through differencing.},

	Abstract = {Stellar population synthesis (SPS) provides the link between the stellar and dust content of galaxies and their observed spectral energy distributions. In the present work, we perform a comprehensive calibration of our own flexible SPS (FSPS) model against a suite of data. These data include ultraviolet, optical, and near-IR photometry, surface brightness fluctuations, and integrated spectra of star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds (MCs), M87, M31, and the Milky Way (MW), and photometry and spectral indices of both quiescent and post-starburst galaxies at z ~ 0. Several public SPS models are intercompared, including the models of Bruzual & Charlot (BC03), Maraston (M05), and FSPS. The relative strengths and weaknesses of these models are evaluated, with the following conclusions: (1) the FSPS and BC03 models compare favorably with MC data at all ages, whereas M05 colors are too red and the age dependence is incorrect; (2) all models yield similar optical and near-IR colors for old metal-poor systems, and yet they all provide poor fits to the integrated J - K and V - K colors of both MW and M31 star clusters; (3) FSPS is able to fit all of the ultraviolet data because both the post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) and horizontal branch evolutionary phases are handled flexibly, while the BC03 and M05 models fail in the far-UV, and both far- and near-UV, respectively; (4) all models predict ugr colors too red, D  n 4000 strengths too strong, and Hdelta A  strengths too weak compared to massive red sequence galaxies, under the assumption that such galaxies are composed solely of old metal-rich stars; and (5) FSPS and, to a lesser extent, BC03 can reproduce the optical and near-IR colors of post-starburst galaxies, while M05 cannot. Reasons for these discrepancies are explored. The failure at predicting the ugr colors, D  n 4000, and Hdelta A  strengths can be explained by some combination of a minority population of metal-poor stars, young stars, blue straggler and/or blue horizontal branch (HB) stars, but not by appealing to inadequacies in either theoretical stellar atmospheres or canonical evolutionary phases (e.g., the main-sequence turnoff). The different model predictions in the near-IR for intermediate age systems are due to different treatments of the thermally pulsating asymptotic giant branch stellar evolutionary phase. We emphasize that due to a lack of calibrating star cluster data in regions of the metallicity-age plane relevant for galaxies, all of these models continue to suffer from serious uncertainties that are difficult to quantify.},

	Abstract = {We explore the effects of using different stellar population models on estimates of star formation histories, ages, and masses of high-redshift galaxies by fitting the SEDs with models by Maraston (hereafter M05) and by Bruzual & Charlot (hereafter BC03). We focus on the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) phase of stellar evolution, whose treatment is a source of major discrepancy. In this respect, BC03 models are representative of other models whose treatment of the TP-AGB phase is similar. Moreover, M05 and BC03 models adopt stellar tracks with different assumptions on convective overshooting. For our experiment we use a sample of high-z (1.4<~z<~2.7) galaxies, for which rest-frame UV spectroscopy and spectroscopic redshifts are available, along with Spitzer IRAC and MIPS photometry from GOODS. The mid-UV spectra of these galaxies exhibit features typical of A- or F-type stars, indicative of ages in the range ~0.2-2 Gyr, when the contribution of TP-AGB stars is expected to be maximum. We find that the TP-AGB phase plays a key role in the interpretation of the Spitzer data, where the rest-frame near-IR is sampled. Generally, M05 models give better fits than BC03 models and indicate systematically lower ages and lower masses (by ~60%, on average). Photometric redshifts derived using M05 models are also in better agreement with the spectroscopic ones, especially when the rest-frame near-IR fluxes from Spitzer IRAC are included in the fit. We argue that the different results are primarily a consequence of the different treatment of the TP-AGB phase, although other differences in the input stellar evolution also contribute. This work provides a first direct evidence for a strong contribution by TP-AGB stars to the SED of galaxies in the high-redshift universe (z~2).},

@article{Maraston:2005,
	Abstract = {Evolutionary population synthesis models for a wide range of metallicities, ages, star formation histories, initial mass functions and horizontal branch morphologies, including blue morphologies at high metallicity, are computed. The model output comprises spectral energy distributions, colours, stellar M/L ratios, bolometric corrections and near-infrared (IR) spectral line indices. The energetics of the post main sequence evolutionary phases are evaluated with the fuel consumption theorem. The impact on the models of the stellar evolutionary tracks (in particular with and without overshooting) is assessed. We find modest differences in synthetic broad-band colours as induced by the use of different tracks in our code [e.g. Delta(V-K) ~ 0.08 mag, Delta(B-V) ~ 0.03 mag]. Noticeably, these differences are substantially smaller than the scatter among other models in the literature, even when the latter adopt the same evolutionary tracks. The models are calibrated with globular cluster data from the Milky Way for old ages, and the Magellanic clouds plus the merger remnant galaxy NGC 7252, both for young ages of ~0.1-2Gyr, in a large wavelength range from the U band to the K band. Particular emphasis is put on the contribution from the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) phase. We show that this evolutionary phase is crucial for the modelling of young stellar populations by direct comparison with observed spectral energy distributions of Magellanic cloud clusters, which are characterized by relatively high fluxes, both blueward and redward of the V band. We find that the combination of the near-IR spectral indices C2 and H2O can be used to determine the metallicity of ~1 Gyr stellar populations. As an illustrative application, we re-analyse the spectral energy distributions of some of the high-z galaxies (2.4 <~z<~ 2.9) observed with the Spitzer Space Telescope by Yan et al. Their high rest-frame near-IR fluxes is reproduced very well with the models including TP-AGB stars for ages in the range ~0.6-1.5Gyr, suggesting formation redshifts for these objects around z~ 3-6.},

Star formation then resumed and has proceeded until the current time at an average rate of roughly 0.2 M sun yr-1, with temporal variations at the factor of 2 level. The re-ignition of star formation about 5 Gyr ago, in both the LMC and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), is suggestive of a dramatic event at that time in the Magellanic system. Among the global variations in the recent star formation rate are peaks at roughly 2 Gyr, 500 Myr, 100 Myr, and 12 Myr. The peaks at 500 Myr and 2 Gyr are nearly coincident with similar peaks in the SFH of the SMC, suggesting a joint history for these galaxies extending back at least several Gyr. The chemical enrichment history recovered from our StarFISH analysis is in broad agreement with that inferred from the LMC's star cluster population, although our constraints on the ancient chemical enrichment history are weak. We conclude from the concordance between the star formation and chemical enrichment histories of the field and cluster populations that the field and cluster star formation modes are tightly coupled.},

	Abstract = {IAC-pop is a code designed to solve the star formation history (SFH) of a complex stellar population system, like a galaxy, from the analysis of the color-magnitude diagram (CMD). It uses a genetic algorithm to minimize a chi2 merit function comparing the star distributions in the observed CMD and the CMD of a synthetic stellar population. A parameterization of the CMDs is used, which is the main input of the code. In fact, the code can be applied to any problem in which a similar parameterization of an experimental set of data and models can be made. The method's internal consistency and robustness against several error sources, including observational effects, data sampling, and stellar evolution library differences, are tested. It is found that the best stability of the solution and the best way to estimate errors are obtained by several runs of IAC-pop with varying the input data parameterization. The routine MinnIAC is used to control this process. IAC-pop is offered for free use and can be downloaded from the site http://iac-star.iac.es/iac-pop. The routine MinnIAC is also offered under request, but support cannot be provided for its use. The only requirement for the use of IAC-pop and MinnIAC is referencing this paper and crediting as indicated in the site.},

@article{Mentuch:2010,
	Abstract = {We have measured the near-infrared colors and the fluxes of individual pixels in 68 galaxies common to the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey and the Large Galaxy Atlas Survey. Each galaxy was separated into regions of increasingly red near-infrared colors. In the absence of dust extinction and other non-stellar emission, stellar populations are shown to have relatively constant NIR colors, independent of age. In regions of high star formation, the average intensity of pixels in red-excess regions (at 1.25, 3.6, 4.5, 5.6, 8.0 and 24 micron) scales linearly with the intrinsic intensity of Halpha emission, and thus with the star-formation rate within the pixel. This suggests that most NIR-excess regions are not red because their light is being depleted by absorption. Instead, they are red because additional infrared light is being contributed by a process linked to star-formation. This is surprising because the shorter wavelength bands in our study (1.25 micron-5.6 micron) do not probe emission from cold (10-20 K) and warm (50-100 K) dust associated with star-formation in molecular clouds. However, emission from hot dust (700-1000 K) and/or Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon molecules can explain the additional emission seen at the shorter wavelengths in our study. The contribution from hot dust and/or PAH emission at 2-5micron and PAH emission at 5.6 and 8.0 micron scales linearly with warm dust emission at 24 micron and the intrinsic Halpha emission. Since both are tied to the star-formation rate, our analysis shows that the NIR excess continuum emission and PAH emission at ~1-8 micron can be added to spectral energy distribution models in a very straight-forward way, by simply adding an additional component to the models that scales linearly with star-formation rate.},

	Abstract = {If the stellar halos of disk galaxies are built up from the disruption of dwarf galaxies, models predict highly structured variations in the stellar populations within these halos. We test this prediction by studying the ratio of blue horizontal branch stars (BHB stars; more abundant in old, metal-poor populations) to main-sequence turn-off stars (MSTO stars; a feature of all populations) in the stellar halo of the Milky Way using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We develop and apply an improved technique to select BHB stars using ugr color information alone, yielding a sample of ~9000 g<18 candidates where ~70% of them are BHB stars. We map the BHB/MSTO ratio across ~1/4 of the sky at the distance resolution permitted by the absolute magnitude distribution of MSTO stars. We find large variations of BHB/MSTO star ratio in the stellar halo. Previously identified, stream-like halo structures have distinctive BHB/MSTO ratios, indicating different ages/metallicities. Some halo features, e.g., the low-latitude structure, appear to be almost completely devoid of BHB stars, whereas other structures appear to be rich in BHB stars. The Sagittarius tidal stream shows an apparent variation in BHB/MSTO ratio along its extent, which we interpret in terms of population gradients within the progenitor dwarf galaxy. Our detection of coherent stellar population variations between different stellar halo substructures provides yet more support to cosmologically motivated models for stellar halo growth.},

	Abstract = {In an attempt to constrain evolutionary models of the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase at the limit of low masses and low metallicities, we have examined the luminosity functions and number ratio between AGB and red giant branch (RGB) stars from a sample of resolved galaxies from the ACS Nearby Galaxy Survey Treasury (ANGST). This database provides HST optical photometry together with maps of completeness, photometric errors, and star formation histories for dozens of galaxies within 4 Mpc. We select 12 galaxies characterized by predominantly metal-poor populations as indicated by a very steep and blue RGB, and which do not present any indication of recent star formation in their color--magnitude diagrams. Thousands of AGB stars brighter than the tip of the RGB (TRGB) are present in the sample (between 60 and 400 per galaxy), hence the Poisson noise has little impact in our measurements of the AGB/RGB ratio. We model the photometric data with a few sets of thermally pulsing AGB (TP-AGB) evolutionary models with different prescriptions for the mass loss. This technique allows us to set stringent constraints to the TP-AGB models of low-mass metal-poor stars (with M<1.5 Msun, [Fe/H]<~-1.0). Indeed, those which satisfactorily reproduce the observed AGB/RGB ratios have TP-AGB lifetimes between 1.2 and 1.8 Myr, and finish their nuclear burning lives with masses between 0.51 and 0.55 Msun. This is also in good agreement with recent observations of white dwarf masses in the M4 old globular cluster. These constraints can be added to those already derived from Magellanic Cloud star clusters as important mileposts in the arduous process of calibrating AGB evolutionary models.},

@article{Bullock:2010,
	Abstract = {The Missing Satellites Problem (MSP) broadly refers to the overabundance of predicted Cold Dark Matter (CDM) subhalos compared to satellite galaxies known to exist in the Local Group. The most popular interpretation of the MSP is that the smallest dark matter halos in the universe are extremely inefficient at forming stars. The question from that standpoint is to identify the feedback source that makes small halos dark and to identify any obvious mass scale where the truncation in the efficiency of galaxy formation occurs. Among the most exciting developments in near-field cosmology in recent years is the discovery of a new population satellite galaxies orbiting the Milky Way and M31. Wide field, resolved star surveys have more than doubled the dwarf satellite count in less than a decade, revealing a population of ultrafaint galaxies that are less luminous that some star clusters. For the first time, there are empirical reasons to believe that there really are missing satellite galaxies in the Local Group, lurking just beyond our ability to detect them, or simply inhabiting a region of the sky that has yet to have been surveyed. Both kinematic studies and completeness-correction studies seem to point to a characteristic potential well depth for satellite subhalos that is quite close to the mass scale where photoionization and atomic cooling should limit galaxy formation. Among the more pressing problems associated with this interpretation is to understand the selection biases that limit our ability to detect the lowest mass galaxies. The least massive satellite halos are likely to host stealth galaxies with very-low surface brightness and this may be an important limitation in the hunt for low-mass fossils from the epoch of reionization.},

@article{Athanassoula:2006,
	Abstract = {The inclination of M31 is too close to edge-on for a bar component to be easily recognized and is not sufficiently edge-on for a boxy/peanut bulge to protrude clearly out of the equatorial plane. Nevertheless, a sufficient number of clues allow us to argue that this galaxy is barred. We use fully self-consistent N-body simulations of barred galaxies and compare them with both photometric and kinematic observational data for M31. In particular, we rely on the near-infrared photometry presented in a companion paper. We compare isodensity contours to isophotal contours and the light profile along cuts parallel to the galaxy major axis and offset towards the north, or the south, to mass profiles along similar cuts on the model. All these comparisons, as well as position-velocity diagrams for the gaseous component, give us strong arguments that M31 is barred. We compare four fiducial N-body models to the data and thus set constraints on the parameters of the M31 bar, as its strength, length and orientation. Our `best' models, although not meant to be exact models of M31, reproduce in a very satisfactory way the main relevant observations. We present arguments that M31 has both a classical and a boxy/peanut bulge. Its pseudo-ring-like structure at roughly 50arcmin is near the outer Lindblad resonance of the bar and could thus be an outer ring, as often observed in barred galaxies. The shape of the isophotes also argues that the vertically thin part of the M31 bar extends considerably further out than its boxy bulge, that is, that the boxy bulge is only part of the bar, thus confirming predictions from orbital structure studies and from previous N-body simulations. It seems very likely that the backbone of M31's boxy bulge is families of periodic orbits, members of the x1-tree and bifurcating from the x1 family at its higher order vertical resonances, such as the x1v3 or x1v4 families.},

@article{Beaton:2007,
	Abstract = {A new, 2.8 deg2 J, H, Ks near-infrared (NIR) survey from the 2MASS 6X program across the extent of the optical disk of the Andromeda (M31) galaxy provides a clear view of the M31 center almost completely unfettered by dust extinction and reveals a high-contrast bulge with very boxy isophotes dominating the NIR light to a semimajor axis of ~700" (2.6 kpc). The inner bulge (<~50") isophotes are relatively circular but show some twisting. Beyond this, (1) the M31 bulge ellipticity increases, (2) its position angle is constant at ~50$\,^{\circ}$, or about 10$\,^{\circ}$ higher than the position angle of the M31 disk, and (3) its boxiness increases to a degree (~3%-4%) comparable to other renowned examples of boxy bulges observed in the NIR. In a companion paper, self-consistent N-body simulations of a classical bulge plus a bar with a boxy bulge are shown to reproduce the observed NIR M31 features presented here. Beyond the boxy bulge region and nearly along the 40$\,^{\circ}$ position angle of the disk a narrow ridge of NIR flux, which can be identified with the thin part of the bar, more or less symmetrically extends into the inner disk at semimajor axis radii of 700"-1200" or more. Little variation in the morphology or relative brightnesses of these various M31 structures is seen across the NIR bands (e.g., no color gradients are seen). These new data verify that M31 is a barred spiral galaxy like the Milky Way.},

@unpublished{Wolff:2004,
	Abstract = {An algorithm for solving nonlinear, multimodal and discontinuous lo- 
cal optimization problems is described. The Nelder-Mead method for 
direct optimization, wherein derivatives are not possible or to expensive 
to determine, has been extended to simple bounds and nonlinear equal- 
ity and inequality constraints, the latter handled by an adaptive linear 
penalty (BNM). To globalize the method, probabilistic restarts are intro- 
duced utilizing a memory of previous iterations. It is attempted to detect 
failures of the local optimizers through reinitializing the simplex. The 
resulting method (GBNM) is particularly suitable for engineering prob- 
lems, where the computational costs, eg. the number of ob jective func- 
tion evaluations, should not exceed a certain limit. Both algorithms were 
implemented in ANSI C/C++ and have been published under the open 
source license LGPL, version 2. The programming interface is explained.

	Abstract = {One of the fundamental difficulties in engineering design is the multiplicity of local solutions. This has triggered much effort in the development of global search algorithms. Globality, however, often has a prohibitively high numerical cost for real problems. A fixed cost local search, which sequentially becomes global, is developed in this work. Globalization is achieved by probabilistic restarts. A spacial probability of starting a local search is built based on past searches. An improved Nelder--Mead algorithm is the local optimizer. It accounts for variable bounds and nonlinear inequality constraints. It is additionally made more robust by reinitializing degenerated simplexes. The resulting method, called the Globalized Bounded Nelder--Mead (GBNM) algorithm, is particularly adapted to tackling multimodal, discontinuous, constrained optimization problems, for which it is uncertain that a global optimization can be afforded. Numerical experiments are given on two analytical test functions and two composite laminate design problems. The GBNM method compares favorably with an evolutionary algorithm, both in terms of numerical cost and accuracy.},

	Abstract = {A method is described for the minimization of a function of n variables, which depends on the comparison of function values at the (n + 1) vertices of a general simplex, followed by the replacement of the vertex with the highest value by another point. The simplex adapts itself to the local landscape, and contracts on to the final minimum. The method is shown to be effective and computationally compact. A procedure is given for the estimation of the Hessian matrix in the neighbourhood of the minimum, needed in statistical estimation problems.


Erratum:
The following alterations are required in the appendix to the above paper which was published in Vol. 7, p. 308.

@article{MacArthur:2009,
	Abstract = {We present a detailed study of the stellar populations (SPs) and kinematics of the bulge and inner disc regions of eight nearby spiral galaxies (Sa-Sd) based on deep Gemini/GMOS data. The long-slit spectra extend to 1-2 disc scalelengths with S/N/{\AA} >= 50. Several different model fitting techniques involving absorption-line indices and full spectrum fitting are explored, and found to weigh age, metallicity and abundance ratios differently. We find that the SPs of spiral galaxies are not well matched by single episodes of star formation; more representative SPs must involve average SP values integrated over the star formation history (SFH) of the galaxy. Our `full population synthesis' method is an optimized linear combination of model templates to the full spectrum with masking of regions poorly represented by the models. Realistic determinations of the SP parameters and kinematics (rotation and velocity dispersion) also rely on careful attention to data/model matching (resolution and flux calibration). The population fits reveal a wide range of age and metallicity gradients (from negative to positive) in the bulge, allowing for diverse formation mechanisms. The observed positive age gradients within the effective radius of some late-type bulges helps reconcile the long-standing conundrum of the coexistence of secular-like kinematics, light profile shape and stellar bar with the `classical'-like old and alpha-enhanced SPs in the Milky Way bulge. The discs, on the other hand, almost always show mildly decreasing to flat profiles in both age and metallicity, consistent with inside-out formation. Our spiral bulges follow the same correlations of increasing light-weighted age and metallicity with central velocity dispersion as those of elliptical galaxies and early-type bulges found in other studies, but when SFHs more complex and realistic than a single burst are invoked, the trend with age is shallower and the scatter much reduced. In a mass-weighted context, however, all bulges are predominantly composed of old and metal-rich SPs. While secular contributions to the evolution of many of our bulges are clearly evident, with young (0.001-1Gyr) SPs contributing as much as 90 per cent of the optical (V-band) light, the bulge mass fraction from young stars is small (<~25 per cent). The implies a bulge formation dominated by early processes that are common to all spheroids, whether they currently reside in discs or not. While monolithic collapse cannot be ruled out in some cases, merging must be invoked to explain the SP gradients in most bulges. Further bulge growth via secular processes or `rejuvenated' star formation generally contributes minimally to the stellar mass budget, with the relative secular weight increasing with decreasing central velocity dispersion.},

@article{Hogg:2010a,
	Abstract = {We go through the many considerations involved in fitting a model to data, using as an example the fit of a straight line to a set of points in a two-dimensional plane. Standard weighted least-squares fitting is only appropriate when there is a dimension along which the data points have negligible uncertainties, and another along which all the uncertainties can be described by Gaussians of known variance; these conditions are rarely met in practice. We consider cases of general, heterogeneous, and arbitrarily covariant two-dimensional uncertainties, and situations in which there are bad data (large outliers), unknown uncertainties, and unknown but expected intrinsic scatter in the linear relationship being fit. Above all we emphasize the importance of having a "generative model" for the data, even an approximate one. Once there is a generative model, the subsequent fitting is non-arbitrary because the model permits direct computation of the likelihood of the parameters or the posterior probability distribution. Construction of a posterior probability distribution is indispensible if there are "nuisance parameters" to marginalize away.},

@article{Stern:2010,
	Abstract = {[NIRSS is one of three concepts that contributed to the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) mission advocated by the Decadal Survey.] Operating beyond the reaches of the Earth's atmosphere, free of its limiting absorption and thermal background, the Near-Infrared Sky Surveyor (NIRSS) will deeply map the entire sky at near-infrared wavelengths, thereby enabling new and fundamental discoveries ranging from the identification of extrasolar planets to probing the reionization epoch by identifying thousands of quasars at z>10. NIRSS will directly address the NASA scientific objective of studying cosmic origins by using a 1.5-meter telescope to reach full-sky 0.2 uJy (25.6 mag AB) sensitivities in four passbands from 1 to 4 microns in a 4-yr mission. At the three shorter passbands (1 - 2.5 microns), the proposed depth is comparable to the deepest pencil-beam surveys done to date and is 3000 times more sensitive than the only previous all-sky near-infrared survey, 2MASS. At the longest passband (3.5 micron), which is not feasible from the ground, NIRSS will be 500 times more sensitive than WISE. NIRSS fills a pivotal gap in our knowledge of the celestial sphere, is a natural complement to WISE, and is well matched to the next generation of deep (0.1 uJy), wide-area (>2 pi ster), ground-based optical surveys (LSST and Pan-Starrs). With the high thermal backgrounds of ground-based infrared observations, a near-infrared full sky survey at sub-uJy sensitivity is only feasible from space.},

	Abstract = {We present high-precision JHK photometry with the 3.8-m UK Infrared Telescope (UKIRT) of 82 standard stars, 28 from the widely used preliminary list known as the `UKIRT Faint Standards', referred to here as the Fundamental List, and 54 additional stars referred to as the Extended List. The stars have 9.4<K<15.0 and all or most should be readily observable with imaging array detectors in normal operating modes on telescopes of up to 10-m aperture. Many are accessible from the southern hemisphere. Arcsec-accuracy positions (J2000, epoch ~1998) are given, together with optical photometry and spectral types from the literature, where available, or inferred from the J-K colour. K-band finding charts are provided for stars with proper motions exceeding 0.3arcsecyr-1. We discuss some pitfalls in the construction of flat-fields for array imagers and a method to avoid them. On 30 nights between late 1994 and early 1998 the stars from the Fundamental List, which were used as standards for the whole programme, were observed on an average of 10 nights each, and those from the Extended List on an average of six nights. The average internal standard error of the mean results for the K magnitudes is 0.005mag for the J-H colours it is 0.003mag for the Fundamental List stars and 0.005mag for those of the Extended List; for H-K the average is 0.004mag. The results are on the natural system of the IRCAM3 imager, which used a 256×256 InSb detector array with `standard' JHK filters, behind gold-coated fore-optics and a gold- or silver-dielectric coated dichroic. We give colour transformations on to the CIT, Arcetri and LCO/Palomar NICMOS systems, and preliminary transformations on to the system defined by the new Mauna Kea Observatory near-infrared filter set.},

The goal of this paper is to dispel the magic behind this black box. This tutorial focuses on building a solid intuition for how and why principal component analysis works; furthermore, it crystallizes this knowledge by deriving from simple intuitions, the mathematics behind PCA. This tutorial does not shy away from explaining the ideas informally, nor does it shy away from the mathematics. The hope is that by addressing both aspects, readers of all levels will be able to gain a better understanding of PCA as well as the when, the how and the why of applying this technique. I.},

	Abstract = {We present a new, and we believe arguably correct, algorithm for producing red-green-blue (RGB) composites from three-band astronomical images. Our method ensures that an object with a specified astronomical color (e.g., g-r and r-i) has a unique color in the RGB image, as opposed to the burnt-out white stars to which we are accustomed. A natural consequence of this is that we can use the same colors to code color-magnitude diagrams, providing a natural ``index'' to our images. We also introduce the use of an arcsinh stretch that allows us to show faint objects while simultaneously preserving the structure of brighter objects in the field, such as the spiral arms of large galaxies. We believe that in addition to their aesthetic value, our images convey far more information than do the traditional ones, and we provide examples from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) imaging, the Hubble Deep Field (HDF), and Chandra to support our claims.4},

This decision is often made arbitrarily or subjectively, but it need not be. A jackknife or leave-one-out cross-validation likelihood is defined and employed as a scalar objective function for optimization of the locations and widths of the bins. The objective is justified as being related to the histogram's usefulness for predicting future data. The method works for data or histograms of any dimensionality.},

	Abstract = {We are developing automated systems to provide homogeneous calibration meta-data for heterogeneous imaging data, using the pixel content of the image alone where necessary. Standardized and complete calibration meta-data permit generative modeling: A good model of the sky through wavelength and time-that is, a model of the positions, motions, spectra, and variability of all stellar sources, plus an intensity map of all cosmological sources-could synthesize or generate any astronomical image ever taken at any time with any equipment in any configuration. We argue that the best-fit or highest likelihood model of the data is also the best possible astronomical catalog constructed from those data. A generative model or catalog of this form is the best possible platform for automated discovery, because it is capable of identifying informative failures of the model in new data at the pixel level, or as statistical anomalies in the joint distribution of residuals from many images. It is also, in some sense, an astronomer's ``theory of everything.''},

	Abstract = {We generalize the well-known mixtures of Gaussians approach to density estimation and the accompanying Expectation-Maximization technique for finding the maximum likelihood parameters of the mixture to the case where each data point carries an individual d-dimensional uncertainty covariance and has unique missing data properties. This algorithm reconstructs the error-deconvolved or "underlying" distribution function common to all samples, even when the individual data points are samples from different distributions, obtained by convolving the underlying distribution with the unique uncertainty distribution of the data point and projecting out the missing data directions. We show how this basic algorithm can be extended with Bayesian priors on all of the model parameters and a "split-and-merge" procedure designed to avoid local maxima of the likelihood. We apply this technique to a few typical astrophysical applications.},

@article{Sharp:2010,
	Abstract = {We report on the limitations of sky subtraction accuracy for long duration fibre-optic multi-object spectroscopy of faint astronomical sources during long duration exposures. We show that while standard sky subtraction techniques yield accuracies consistent with the Poisson noise limit for exposures of 1 hour duration, there are large scale systematic defects that inhibit the sensitivity gains expected on the summation of longer duration exposures. For the AAOmega system at the Anglo-Australian Telescope we identify a limiting systematic sky subtraction accuracy which is reached after integration times of 4-10 hours. We show that these systematic defects can be avoided through the use of the fibre nod-and-shuffle observing mode, but with potential cost in observing efficiency. Finally we demonstrate that these disadvantages can be overcome through the application of a Principle Components Analysis sky subtraction routine. Such an approach minimise systematic residuals across long duration exposures allowing deep integrations. We apply the PCA approach to over 200 hours of on-sky observations and conclude that for the AAOmega system the residual error in long duration observations falls at a rate proportional to t^-0.32 in contrast to the t^-0.5 rate expected from theoretical considerations. With this modest rate of decline, the PCA approach represents a more efficient mode of observation than the nod-and-shuffle technique for observations in the sky limited regime with durations of 10-100 hours (even before accounting for the additional signal-to-noise and targeting efficiency losses often associated with the N+S technique).[abridged]},

Both parametric fits through a two dimensional bulge disk decomposition as well as structural parameter measurements like concentration, asymmetry etc. are supported. The pipeline is designed to be easy to use yet flexible; individual software modules can be replaced with ease. A find-and-fit mode is available so that all galaxies in a image can be measured with a simple command. A parallel version of the Pymorph pipeline runs on computer clusters and a Virtual Observatory compatible web enabled interface is under development.},

	Abstract = {Scientific data sets continue to increase in both size and complexity. In the past, dedicated graphics systems at supercomputing centers were required to visualize large data sets, but as the price of commodity graphics hardware has dropped and its capability has increased, it is now in principle possible to view large complex data sets on a single workstation. To do this in practice, an investigator will need software that is written to take advantage of the relevant graphics hardware. The viewpoints visualization package described herein is an example of such software. Viewpoints is an interactive tool for exploratory visual analysis of large, high-dimensional (multivariate) data. It leverages the capabilities of modern graphics boards (GPUs) to run on a single workstation or laptop. Viewpoints is minimalist: it attempts to do a small set of useful things very well (or at least very quickly) in comparison to similar packages today. Its basic feature set includes linked scatter plots with brushing, dynamic histograms, normalization and outlier detection/removal. Viewpoints was originally designed for astrophysicists, but it has since being used in a variety of fields that range from astronomy, quantum chemistry, fluid dynamics, machine learning, bioinformatics, and finance to IT server log mining. In this paper, we describe the viewpoints package and show examples of its usage.},

@article{Cid-Fernandes:2005,
	Abstract = {The study of stellar populations in galaxies is entering a new era with the availability of large and high-quality data bases of both observed galactic spectra and state-of-the-art evolutionary synthesis models. In this paper we investigate the power of spectral synthesis as a means to estimate the physical properties of galaxies. Spectral synthesis is nothing more than the decomposition of an observed spectrum in terms of a superposition of a base of simple stellar populations of various ages and metallicities, producing as output the star formation and chemical histories of a galaxy, its extinction and velocity dispersion. Our implementation of this method uses the recent models of Bruzual & Charlot and observed spectra in the 3650-8000 {\AA} range. The reliability of this approach is studied by three different means: (1) simulations, (2) comparison with previous work based on a different technique, and (3) analysis of the consistency of results obtained for a sample of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).  We find that spectral synthesis provides reliable physical parameters as long as one does not attempt a very detailed description of the star formation and chemical histories. Robust and physically interesting parameters are obtained by combining the (individually uncertain) strengths of each simple stellar population in the base. In particular, we show that, besides providing excellent fits to observed galaxy spectra, this method is able to recover useful information on the distributions of stellar ages and, more importantly, stellar metallicities. Stellar masses, velocity dispersion and extinction are also found to be accurately retrieved for realistic signal-to-noise ratios.  We apply this synthesis method to a volume-limited sample of 50362 galaxies from the SDSS Data Release 2, producing a catalogue of stellar population properties. Emission lines are also studied, their measurement being performed after subtracting the computed starlight spectrum from the observed one. A comparison with recent estimates of both observed and physical properties of these galaxies obtained by other groups shows good qualitative and quantitative agreement, despite substantial differences in the methods of analysis. The confidence in the present method is further strengthened by several empirical and astrophysically reasonable correlations between synthesis results and independent quantities. For instance, we report the existence of strong correlations between stellar and nebular metallicities, stellar and nebular extinctions, mean stellar age and equivalent width of Halpha and 4000-{\AA} break, and between stellar mass and velocity dispersion.},

@article{Dye:2008,
	Abstract = {A new method of determining galaxy star formation histories (SFHs) is presented. Using the method, the feasibility of recovering SFHs with multiband photometry is investigated. The method divides a galaxy's history into discrete time intervals and reconstructs the average rate of star formation in each interval. This directly gives the total stellar mass. A simple linear inversion solves the problem of finding the most likely discretized SFH for a given set of galaxy parameters. It is shown how formulating the method within a Bayesian framework lets the data simultaneously select the optimal regularization strength and the most appropriate number of discrete time intervals for the reconstructed SFH. The method is demonstrated by applying it to monometallic synthetic photometric catalogues created with different input SFHs, assessing how the accuracy of the recovered SFHs and stellar masses depend on the photometric passband set, signal-to-noise ratio and redshift. The results show that reconstruction of SFHs using multiband photometry is possible, being able to distinguish an early burst of star formation from a late one, provided an appropriate passband set is used. Although the resolution of the recovered SFHs is on average inferior compared to what can be achieved with spectroscopic data, the multiband approach can process a significantly larger number of galaxies per unit exposure time.},

	Abstract = {Astronomical instruments make intensity measurements; any precise astronomical experiment ought to involve modeling those measurements. People make catalogues, but because a catalogue requires hard decisions about calibration and detection, no catalogue can contain all of the information in the raw pixels relevant to most scientific investigations. Here we advocate making catalogue-like data outputs that permit investigators to test hypotheses with almost the power of the original image pixels. The key is to provide users with approximations to likelihood tests against the raw image pixels. We advocate three options, in order of increasing difficulty: The first is to define catalogue entries and associated uncertainties such that the catalogue contains the parameters of an approximate description of the image-level likelihood function. The second is to produce a K-catalogue sampling in "catalogue space" that samples a posterior probability distribution of catalogues given the data. The third is to expose a web service or equivalent that can re-compute on demand the full image-level likelihood for any user-supplied catalogue.},

	Abstract = {Fitting the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of galaxies is an almost universally used technique that has matured significantly in the last decade. Model predictions and fitting procedures have improved significantly over this time, attempting to keep up with the vastly increased volume and quality of available data. We review here the field of SED fitting, describing the modelling of ultraviolet to infrared galaxy SEDs, the creation of multiwavelength data sets, and the methods used to fit model SEDs to observed galaxy data sets. We touch upon the achievements and challenges in the major ingredients of SED fitting, with a special emphasis on describing the interplay between the quality of the available data, the quality of the available models, and the best fitting technique to use in order to obtain a realistic measurement as well as realistic uncertainties. We conclude that SED fitting can be used effectively to derive a range of physical properties of galaxies, such as redshift, stellar masses, star formation rates, dust masses, and metallicities, with care taken not to over-interpret the available data. Yet there still exist many issues such as estimating the age of the oldest stars in a galaxy, finer details ofdust properties and dust-star geometry, and the influences of poorly understood, luminous stellar types and phases. The challenge for the coming years will be to improve both the models and the observational data sets to resolve these uncertainties. The present review will be made available on an interactive, moderated web page (sedfitting.org), where the community can access and change the text. The intention is to expand the text and keep it up to date over the coming years.},

	Abstract = {We present a high spatial resolution Halpha survey of 23 cooling flow clusters using the Maryland Magellan Tunable Filter (MMTF), covering 1-2 orders of magnitude in cooling rate, dM/dt, temperature and entropy. We find 8/23 (35%) of our clusters have complex, filamentary morphologies at Halpha, while an additional 7/23 (30%) have marginally extended or nuclear Halpha emission, in general agreement with previous studies of line emission in cooling flow cluster BCGs. A weak correlation between the integrated near-UV luminosity and the Halpha luminosity is also found for our complete sample, with a large amount of scatter about the expected relation for photoionization by young stars. We detect Halpha emission out to the X-ray cooling radius, but no further, in several clusters and find a strong correlation between the Halpha luminosity contained in filaments and the X-ray cooling flow rate of the cluster, suggesting that the warm ionized gas is linked to the cooling flow. Furthermore, we detect a strong enhancement in the cooling properties of the ICM coincident with the Halpha emission, compared to the surrounding ICM at the same radius. While the filaments in a few clusters may be entrained by buoyant radio bubbles, in general, the radially-infalling cooling flow model provides a better explanation for the observed trends. The correlation of the Halpha and X-ray properties suggests that conduction may be important in keeping the filaments ionized. The thinness of the filaments suggests that magnetic fields are an important part of channeling the gas and shielding it from the surrounding hot ICM.},

	Abstract = {A practical step-by-step guide to wavelet analysis is given, with examples taken from time series of the El Ni{\~n}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The guide includes a comparison to the windowed Fourier transform, the choice of an appropriate wavelet basis function, edge effects due to finite-length time series, and the relationship between wavelet scale and Fourier frequency. New statistical significance tests for wavelet power spectra are developed by deriving theoretical wavelet spectra for white and red noise processes and using these to establish significance levels and confidence intervals. It is shown that smoothing in time or scale can be used to increase the confidence of the wavelet spectrum. Empirical formulae are given for the effect of smoothing on significance levels and confidence intervals. Extensions to wavelet analysis such as filtering, the power Hovm{\"o}ller, cross-wavelet spectra, and coherence are described.
The statistical significance tests are used to give a quantitative measure of changes in ENSO variance on interdecadal time scales. Using new datasets that extend back to 1871, the Ni{\~n}o3 sea surface temperature and the Southern Oscillation Index show significantly higher power during 1880--1920 and 1960--90, and lower power during 1920--60, as well as a possible 15-yr modulation of variance. The power Hovm{\"o}ller of sea level pressure shows significant variations in 2--8-yr wavelet power in both longitude and time.},

	Abstract = {We have measured spatial and temporal variability in the -band sky brightness over the course of four nights above Cerro Tololo near Cerro Pachon, Chile, the planned site for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). Our wide-angle camera lens provided a 41$\,^{\circ}$ field of view and a 145'' pixel scale. We minimized potential system throughput differences by deploying a deep-depletion CCD and a filter that matches the proposed LSST y3 band (970 -1030 nm). Images of the sky  exhibited coherent wave structure, attributable to atmospheric gravity waves  at 90 km altitude, creating 3%-4% rms spatial sky flux variability on scales of about 2$\,^{\circ}$ and larger. Over the course of a full night, the y3 band additionally showed highly coherent temporal variability of up to a factor of 2 in flux. We estimate the mean absolute sky level to be approximately y3 = 17.8 mag(Vega), or y3 - 18.3 mag (AB). While our observations were made through a y3 filter, the relative  sky brightness variability should hold for all proposed y bands, whereas the  absolute levels should more strongly depend on spectral response. The spatial  variability presents a challenge to wide-field cameras that require  illumination correction strategies that make use of stacked sky flats. The  temporal variability may warrant an adaptive  band imaging strategy for LSST,  to take advantage of times when the sky is darkest.},

	Abstract = {The emission of the upper atmosphere introduces an additional variable component into observations of astronomical objects in the NIR 700 3,000 nm range. The subtraction of this component is not easy because it varies during the night by as much as 100% and it is not homogeneous over the sky. A program aimed at measuring and understanding the main characteristics of the atmospheric NIR emission was undertaken. A 512 × 512 CCD camera equipped with a RG780/2 mm filter is used to obtain images of the sky in a 36$\,^{\circ}$ × 36$\,^{\circ}$ field of view. The intensities of a given star and of the nearby region devoid of star in a 439 arcmin2 area are monitored during periods of time of several hours. The sky intensity measured in the 754 900 nm bandpass, reduced to zenith and zero airmass is comprised between mag20 and mag18.5 per arcsecond2. A diminution by a factor of two during the night is frequently observed. Intensity fluctuations having an amplitude of 15% and periods of 5 40 min are present in the images with a structure of regularly spaced stripes. The fluctuations of the NIR sky background intensity are due to (1) the chemical evolution of the upper atmosphere composition during the night and (2) dynamical processes such as tides with periods of 3 6 h or gravity waves with periods of several tens of minutes. We suggest that a monitoring of the sky background intensity could be set up when quantitative observations of astronomical objects require exposure times longer than ~10 min.

Adopting a representation this coarse reduces bandwidth for data acquisition, transmission, or storage, or permits better use of the system dynamic range, without sacrificing any information for downstream data analysis, including information on sources fainter than the minimum representable difference itself.},

	Abstract = { As panoramic photography becomes increasingly popular, there is a greater need for high-quality software to automatically create panoramic images. Existing algorithms either produce a rough "stitch" that cannot deal with common artifacts, or require user input. This paper presents methods for dealing with two artifacts that often occur in practice. Our first contribution is a method for dealing with objects that move between different views of a dynamic scene. If such moving objects are left in, they will appear blurry and "ghosted". Treating such regions as nodes in a graph, we use a vertex cover algorithm to selectively remove all but one instance of each object. Our second contribution is a method for continuously adjusting exposure across multiple images in order to eliminate visible shifts in brightness or hue. We compute exposure corrections on a block-by block basis, then smoothly interpolate the parameters using a spline to get spatially continuous exposure adjustment. Our enhancements, combined with previously published techniques for automatic image stitching, result in a high-quality automated stitcher that exhibits far fewer artifacts than existing software.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the ability of spectroscopic techniques to yield realistic star formation histories (SFHs) for the bulges of spiral galaxies based on a comparison with their observed broadband colors. Full spectrum fitting to optical spectra indicates that recent (within ~1 Gyr) star formation activity can contribute significantly to the V-band flux, whilst accounting for only a minor fraction of the stellar mass budget which is made up primarily of old stars. Furthermore, recent implementations of stellar population (SP) models reveal that the inclusion of a more complete treatment of the thermally pulsating asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) phase to SP models greatly increases the NIR flux for SPs of ages 0.2-2 Gyr. Comparing the optical--NIR colors predicted from population synthesis fitting, using models which do not include all stages of the TP-AGB phase, to the observed colors reveals that observed optical--NIR colors are too red compared to the model predictions. However, when a 1 Gyr SP from models including a full treatment the TP-AGB phase is used, the observed and predicted colors are in good agreement. This has strong implications for the interpretation of stellar populations, dust content, and SFHs derived from colors alone.},

@article{Silva:2010,
	Abstract = {The spectral energy distribution of galaxies is a complex function of the star formation history and geometrical arrangement of stars and gas in galaxies. The computation of the radiative transfer of stellar radiation through the dust distribution is time-consuming. This aspect becomes unacceptable in particular when dealing with the predictions by semi-analytical galaxy formation models populating cosmological volumes, to be then compared with multi-wavelength surveys. Mainly for this aim, we have implemented an artificial neural network algorithm into the spectro-photometric and radiative transfer code GRASIL in order to compute the spectral energy distribution of galaxies in a short computing time. This allows to avoid the adoption of empirical templates that may have nothing to do with the mock galaxies output by models. The ANN has been implemented to compute the dust emission spectrum (the bottleneck of the computation), and separately for the star-forming molecular clouds and the diffuse dust (due to their different properties and dependencies). We have defined the input neurons effectively determining their emission, which means this implementation has a general applicability and is not linked to a particular galaxy formation model. We have trained the net for the disc and spherical geometries, and tested its performance to reproduce the SED of disc and starburst galaxies, as well as for a semi-analytical model for spheroidal galaxies. We have checked that for this model both the SEDs and the galaxy counts in the Herschel bands obtained with the ANN approximation are almost superimposed to the same quantities obtained with the full GRASIL. We conclude that this method appears robust and advantageous, and will present the application to a more complex SAM in another paper.},

	Abstract = {The Montage software suite has proven extremely useful as a general engine for reprojecting, background matching, and mosaicking astronomical image data from a wide variety of sources.  The processing algorithms support all common World Coordinate System (WCS) projections and have been shown to be both astrometrically accurate and flux conserving.  The background `matching' algorithm does not remove background flux but rather finds the best compromise background based on all the input and matches the individual images to that.  The Infrared Science Archive (IRSA), part of the Infrared Processing and Analysis Center (IPAC) at Caltech, has now wrapped the Montage software as a CGI service and provided a compute and request management infrastructure capable of producing approximately 2 TBytes / day of  image mosaic output (e.g. from 2MASS and SDSS data).  Besides the basic Montage engine, this service makes use of a 16-node LINUX cluster (dual processor, dual core) and the ROME request management software developed by the National Virtual Observatory (NVO).  ROME uses EJB/database technology to manage user requests, queue processing and load balance between users, and  managing job monitoring and user notification.  The Montage service will be extended  to process user-defined data collections, including private data uploads.},

	Abstract = {We have built a reliable and robust system that takes as input an astronomical image, and returns as output the pointing, scale, and orientation of that image (the astrometric calibration or World Coordinate System information). The system requires no first guess, and works with the information in the image pixels alone; that is, the problem is a generalization of the "lost in space" problem in which nothing---not even the image scale---is known. After robust source detection is performed in the input image, asterisms (sets of four or five stars) are geometrically hashed and compared to pre-indexed hashes to generate hypotheses about the astrometric calibration. A hypothesis is only accepted as true if it passes a Bayesian decision theory test against a null hypothesis. With indices built from the USNO-B catalog and designed for uniformity of coverage and redundancy, the success rate is >99.9% for contemporary near-ultraviolet and visual imaging survey data, with no false positives. The failure rate is consistent with the incompleteness of the USNO-B catalog; augmentation with indices built from the Two Micron All Sky Survey catalog brings the completeness to 100% with no false positives. We are using this system to generate consistent and standards-compliant meta-data for digital and digitized imaging from plate repositories, automated observatories, individual scientific investigators, and hobbyists. This is the first step in a program of making it possible to trust calibration meta-data for astronomical data of arbitrary provenance.},

	Abstract = {The WCSTools package was originally developed to create and access world coordinate systems in FITS image headers.  In order to do that, programs and subroutines which access, modify, and extract information from FITS image headers and data, extract information from catalogs of sources, and manipulate sky, image, and time coordinates have been developed. Package functionality has always been available at both the subroutine level for developers of other packages, such as ds9, and at the scripting level for use in data processing pipelines. On the occasion of a major upgrade to the latest level of Mark Calabretta's WCSLIB library, lesser-known features, such as data and time format conversions and command line name to coordinate resolution will be presented along with descriptions of several other feature.},

This scheme has been incorporated by the Spitzer Science Center  (SSC) into its imaging products, and it is under consideration for wider use.  The SIP keywords are read and applied by the SSC's MOPEX mosaicking software, and by several standard analysis tools, including WCSTools, SAOImage, DS9, GAIA/Starlink AST, IDL ASTROLIB, and Drizzle. We provide definitions of how these keywords are used together with standard FITS World Coordinate System (WCS) keywords to relate pixel  coordinates to the sky.  Some examples illustrate the application of this scheme to actual distorted data.},

	Abstract = {We derive distributions of dust temperature and dust opacity across M31 at 45" resolution using the Spitzer data. With the opacity map and a standard dust model we de-redden the Ha emission yielding the first de-reddened Ha map of M31. We compare the emissions from dust, Ha, HI and H2 by means of radial distributions, pixel-to-pixel correlations and wavelet cross-correlations. The dust temperature steeply decreases from 30K near the center to 15K at large radii. The mean dust optical depth at the Ha wavelength along the line of sight is about 0.7. The radial decrease of the dust-to-gas ratio is similar to that of the oxygen abundance. On scales<2kpc, cold dust emission is best correlated with that of neutral gas and warm dust emission with that of ionized gas. Ha emission is slightly better correlated with emission at 70um than at 24um. In the area 6kpc<R< 17kpc, the total SFR is ~0.3Msun/yr. The Kennicutt-Schmidt law between SFR and total gas has a power-law index of 1.30+-0.05 in the radial range of R=7-11kpc increasing by about 0.3 for R=11-13kpc. The lack of H2 in the central region could be related to the lack of HI and the low opacity/high temperature of the dust. Since neither SFR nor SFE is well correlated with the surface density of H2 or total gas, other factors than gas density must play an important role in the formation of massive stars in M31. The molecular depletion time scale of 1.1 Gyr indicates that M31 is about three times less efficient in forming young massive stars than M33.},

	Abstract = {The distribution of chemical abundances and their variation in time are important tools to understand the chemical evolution of galaxies: in particular, the study of chemical evolution models can improve our understanding of the basic assumptions made for modelling our Galaxy and other spirals. To test a standard chemical evolution model for spiral disks in the Local Universe and study the influence of a threshold gas density and different efficiencies in the star formation rate (SFR) law on radial gradients (abundance, gas and SFR). We adopt a one-infall chemical evolution model where the Galactic disk forms inside-out by means of infall of gas, and we test different thresholds and efficiencies in the SFR. The model is scaled to the disk properties of three Local Group galaxies (the Milky Way, M31 and M33) by varying its dependence on the star formation efficiency and the time scale for the infalling gas into the disk. Using this simple model we are able to reproduce most of the observed constraints available in the literature for the studied galaxies. The radial oxygen abundance gradients and their time evolution are studied in detail. The present day abundance gradients are more sensitive to the threshold than to other parameters, while their temporal evolutions are more dependent on the chosen SFR efficiency. The most massive disks seem to have evolved faster (i.e. with more efficient star formation) than the less massive ones, thus suggesting a downsizing in star formation for spirals. The threshold and the efficiency of star formation play a very important role in the chemical evolution of spiral disks and an efficiency varying with radius can be used to regulate the star formation. The oxygen abundance gradient can steepen or flatten in time depending on the choice of this parameter},

	Abstract = {The methods of effective field theory are used to study generic theories of inflation with a single inflaton field and to perform a general analysis of the associated non-Gaussianities. We investigate the amplitudes and shapes of the various generic three-point correlators, the bispectra, which may be generated by different classes of single-field inflationary models. Besides the well-known results for the DBI-like models and the ghost inflationary theories, we point out that curvature-related interactions may give rise to large non-Gaussianities in the form of bispectra characterized by a flat shape which is rather uncommon in single-field models of inflation. In a subsequent work, we will perform a similar general analysis for the non-Gaussianities generated by the generic four-point correlator, the trispectrum.},

	Abstract = {We present a statistical characterization of the carbon-star to M-giant (C/M) ratio in the halo of M31. Based on application of pseudo-filter band passes to our Keck/DEIMOS spectra we measure the 81-77-color index of 1288 stars in the giant stellar stream and in halo fields out to large distances. From this well-established narrow-band system, supplemented by V-I colors, we find only a low number (five in total) of C-star candidates. The resulting low C/M ratio of 10% is consistent with the values in the M31 disk and inner halo from the literature. Although our analysis is challenged by small number statistics and our sample selection, there is an indication that the oxygen-rich M-giants occur in similar number throughout the entire halo. We also find no difference in the C-star population of the halo fields compared to the giant stream. The very low C/M ratio is at odds with the observed low metallicities and the presence of intermediate-age stars at large radii. Our observed absence of a substantial carbon star population in the these regions indicates that the (outer) M31 halo cannot be dominated by the debris of disk-like or SMC-type galaxies, but rather resemble the dwarf elliptical NGC 147.},

@article{Saglia:2010,
	Abstract = {We present new optical long-slit data along six position angles of the bulge region of M 31. We derive accurate stellar and gas kinematics reaching 5 arcmin from the center, where the disk light contribution is always less than 30%, and out to 8 arcmin along the major axis, where the disk provides 55% of the total light. We show that the velocity dispersions of McElroy (1983) are severely underestimated (by up to 50 km s-1). As a consequence, previous dynamical models have underestimated the stellar mass of M 31's bulge by a factor of 2. As a further consequence, the light-weighted velocity dispersion of the galaxy grows to 166 km s-1 and to 170 km s-1 if rotation is also taken into account, thus reducing the discrepancy between the predicted and measured mass of the black hole at the center of M 31 from a factor of 3 to a factor of 2. The kinematic position angle varies with distance, pointing to triaxiality, but a quantitative conclusion can be reached only after simultaneous proper dynamical modeling of the bulge and disk components is performed. We detect gas counterrotation near the bulge minor axis. We measure eight emission-corrected Lick indices. They are approximately constant on circles. Using simple stellar population models we derive the age, metallicity and alpha-element overabundance profiles. Except for the region in the inner arcsecs of the galaxy, the bulge of M 31 is uniformly old (>= 12 Gyr, with many best-fit ages at the model grid limit of 15 Gyr), slightly alpha-elements overabundant ([alpha/Fe] ≈ 0.2) and of solar metallicity, in agreement with studies of the resolved stellar components. The predicted u-g, g-r and r-i Sloan color profiles match the dust-corrected observations reasonably well, within the known limitations of current simple stellar population models. The stellar populations have approximately radially constant mass-to-light ratios (M/LR ≈ 4-4.5 M_o/L_o for a Kroupa IMF), which is in agreement with the stellar dynamical estimates based on our new velocity dispersions. In the inner arcsecs the luminosity-weighted age drops to 4-8 Gyr, while the metallicity increases to above three times the solar value. Starting from 6 arcmin from the center along the major axis, the mean age drops to <=8 Gyr with slight supersolar metallicity (≈ +0.1 dex) and alpha-element overabundance (≈ +0.2 dex) for a mass-to-light ratio M/LR <= 3 M_o/L_o. Diagnostic diagrams based on the [OIII]/Hbeta and [NI]/Hbeta emission line equivalent widths (EWs) ratios indicate that the gas is ionized by shocks outside 10 arcsec, but an AGN-like ionizing source could be present near the center. We speculate that a gas-rich minor merger happened some 100 Myr ago, causing the observed minor axis gas counterrotation, the recent star formation event and possibly some nuclear activity.

	Abstract = {The spatial distribution of stars in the nearby S0 galaxy NGC 5102 is investigated using images obtained with WIRCam and MegaCam on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. With the exception of gaps between detector elements, the entire galaxy is surveyed in r' and i', while the J and Ks data extend out to R GC ≈ 6 kpc, which corresponds to almost 7 disk scale lengths. A modest population of main-sequence stars with MV < -3.5 and ages ≈70 Myr are detected throughout the disk, with the majority located in the southern half of the galaxy. The stellar disk in the northern half of the galaxy is warped, following structure that is also seen in H I. Objects with photometric properties that are consistent with those of bright asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars are seen throughout the disk, and the ratio of C stars to bright M giants is consistent with an overall increase in the star formation rate within the past 1 Gyr. Star-forming activity during the interval 0.1-2 Gyr was more centrally concentrated than during the past ≈100 Myr. The structure of the disk changes near R GC ≈ 5 kpc (5.5 disk scale lengths), in the sense that the radial surface density profile defined by red supergiants (RSGs) and bright AGB stars levels off at larger radii. RSGs and bright AGB stars are traced out to a radius of 14 kpc (15.6 scale lengths) along the southern portion of the major axis, while a tentative detection is also made of bright AGB stars at a projected distance of ≈16 kpc along the southeast minor axis. A large clump of AGB stars that subtends ≈1 arcmin is identified to the west of the galaxy center. It is argued that this is the remnant of a companion galaxy that triggered past episodes of elevated star-forming activity.  ,,},

	Abstract = {Based on 13 nights of observations of four fields in NGC 300, we have set up an extensive sequence of stars with accurate BVI photometry covering a relatively large (25'×25') region centered on this galaxy. This sequence of standard stars is very useful for calibrating the photometry of variable stars and other objects in NGC 300 and other galaxies obtained from wide-field mosaic images. Our standard-star list contains B, V, and I measurements for 390 stars. The accuracy of the zero points in the V filter and B-V color is better than 0.02 mag, and about 0.03 mag for the V-I color. We found very good agreement between our measurements and those previously obtained by Walker for 26 stars near NGC 300. Based on observations obtained with the 1.3 m Warsaw telescope at the Las Campanas Observatory of the Carnegie Institution of Washington and with the 2.2 m ESO/Max-Planck-Institut telescope at the European Southern Observatory.},

	Abstract = {We have obtained deep imaging in the near-infrared J and K bands for two nearby fields in the bar of the LMC with the ESO New Technology Telescope, under exquisite seeing conditions. The K, J-K color-magnitude diagrams constructed from these data are of outstanding photometric quality and reveal the presence of several hundred red clump stars. Using the calibration of Alves for the K-band absolute magnitude of Hipparcos-observed red clump stars in the solar neighborhood, we derive a distance modulus to our observed LMC fields of 18.487 mag. Applying a correction for the tilt of the LMC bar with respect to the line of sight according to the geometrical model of van der Marel et al., the corresponding LMC barycenter distance is 18.501 mag. The random error on this result is +/-0.008 mag, whereas the systematic uncertainty on this distance result due to the photometric zero-point uncertainty in our LMC K-band photometry, to the uncertainty of the Hipparcos-based absolute magnitude calibration of red clump stars in the solar neighborhood, and to reddening uncertainties mounts up to +/-0.048 mag. If we adopt a K-band population correction of -0.03 mag, as done by Alves et al., to account for the difference in age and metallicity between the solar neighborhood and LMC red clump star populations, we obtain an LMC barycenter distance modulus of 18.471 mag from our data. This is in excellent agreement with the results of Alves et al. and those of another very recent study by Sarajedini et al. obtained from K-band photometry. However, we emphasize that current model predictions about the uncertainties of population corrections seem to indicate that errors up to about 0.12 mag may be possible, probably in any photometric band. Therefore, work must continue to tighten the constraints on these corrections. We also determine the mean red clump star magnitude in our LMC fields in the J band, which could be a useful alternative to the K band should future work reveal that population effect corrections for red clump stars in the J band are smaller or more reliably determined than those for the K band.

	Abstract = {We present a suite of semianalytic disk-bulge-halo models for the Andromeda galaxy (M31) that satisfy three fundamental conditions: (1) internal self-consistency, (2) consistency with observational data, and (3) stability of the disk against the formation of a central bar. The models are chosen from a set first constructed by Kuijken & Dubinski. We develop an algorithm to search the parameter space for this set in order to best match observations of the M31 rotation curve, inner velocity dispersion profile, and surface brightness profile. Models are obtained for a large range of bulge and disk masses; we find that the disk mass must be <~8×1010 Msolar and that the preferred value for the bulge mass is 2.5×1010 Msolar. N-body simulations are carried out to test the stability of our models against the formation of a bar within the disk. We also calculate the baryon fraction and halo concentration parameter for a subset of our models and show that the results are consistent with the predictions from cosmological theories of structure formation. In addition, we describe how gravitational microlensing surveys and dynamical studies of globular clusters and satellites can further constrain the models.},

@article{Navarro:1996,
	Abstract = {We use N-body simulations to investigate the structure of dark halos in the standard cold dark matter cosmogony. Halos are excised from simulations of cosmologically representative regions and are resimulated individually at high resolution. We study objects with masses ranging from those of dwarf galaxy halos to those of rich galaxy clusters. The spherically averaged density profiles of all our halos can be fitted over two decades in radius by scaling a simple "universal" profile. The characteristic over- density of a halo, or equivalently its concentration, correlates strongly with halo mass in a way that reflects the mass dependence of the epoch of halo formation. Halo profiles are approximately isothermal over a large range in radii but are significantly shallower than r -2 near the center and steeper than r-2 near the virial radius. Matching the observed rotation curves of disk galaxies requires disk mass-to-light ratios to increase systematically with luminosity. Further, it suggests that the halos of bright galaxies depend only weakly on galaxy luminosity and have circular velocities significantly lower than the disk rotation speed. This may explain why luminosity and dynamics are uncorrelated in observed samples of binary galaxies and of satellite/spiral systems. For galaxy clusters, our halo models are consistent both with the presence of giant arcs and with the observed structure of the intracluster medium, and they suggest a simple explanation for the disparate estimates of cluster core radii found by previous authors. Our results also highlight two shortcomings of the CDM model. CDM halos are too concentrated to be consistent with the halo parameters inferred for dwarf irregulars, and the predicted abundance of galaxy halos is larger than the observed abundance of galaxies. The first problem may imply that the core structure of dwarf galaxies was altered by the galaxy formation process, and the second problem may imply that galaxies failed to form (or remain undetected) in many dark halos.},

	Abstract = {The dark matter dominated Fornax dwarf spheroidal has five globular clusters orbiting at ~1kpc from its centre. In a cuspy cold dark matter halo the globulars would sink to the centre from their current positions within a few Gyr, presenting a puzzle as to why they survive undigested at the present epoch. We show that a solution to this timing problem is to adopt a cored dark matter halo. We use numerical simulations and analytic calculations to show that, under these conditions, the sinking time becomes many Hubble times; the globulars effectively stall at the dark matter core radius. We conclude that the Fornax dwarf spheroidal has a shallow inner density profile with a core radius constrained by the observed positions of its globular clusters. If the phase space density of the core is primordial then it implies a warm dark matter particle and gives an upper limit to its mass of ~0.5keV, consistent with that required to significantly alleviate the substructure problem.},

	Abstract = {We present a synthesis of recent photometric and kinematic data for several of the most dark matter dominated galaxies, the dwarf spheroidal Galactic satellites, and compare them to star clusters. There is a bimodal distribution in half-light radii, with stable star clusters always being smaller than ~30 pc, while stable galaxies are always larger than ~120 pc. We extend the previously known observational relationships and interpret them in terms of a more fundamental pair of intrinsic properties of dark matter itself: dark matter forms cored mass distributions, with a core scale length of greater than about 100 pc, and always has a maximum central mass density within a narrow range. The dark matter in dSph galaxies appears to be clustered such that there is a mean volume mass density within the stellar distribution which has the very low value of less than about 0.1 Msolar pc-3 (about 5 GeV/c2 cm-3). All dSph's have velocity dispersions at the edge of their light distributions equivalent to circular velocities of ~15 km s-1. The maximum central dark matter density derived is model dependent but is likely to have a characteristic value (averaged over a volume of radius 10 pc) of ~0.1 Msolar pc-3 for the favored cored dark mass distributions (where it is similar to the mean value), or ~60 M solar pc-3 (about 2 TeV/c2 cm-3) if the dark matter density distribution is cusped. Galaxies are embedded in dark matter halos with these properties; smaller systems containing dark matter are not observed. These values provide new information about the nature of the dominant form of dark matter.},

	Abstract = {We have performed TreeSPH simulations of disk galaxy formation in various warm dark matter (WDM) cosmologies. Our results indicate that for a range of WDM free-streaming masses, the disk galaxy formation angular momentum problem can be considerably alleviated (and, we speculate, perhaps even completely resolved) by going to the WDM structure formation scenario, without having to invoke stellar feedback processes. They also strongly suggest that part of the angular momentum problem is due to numerical effects, most likely related to the shock-capturing artificial viscosity used in smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). Furthermore, we find that we can match the observed I-band Tully-Fisher (TF) relation, provided that the mass-to-light ratio of disk galaxies is M/LI~=0.6-0.7. We argue that this is a fairly reasonable value compared to various dynamical and spectrophotometric estimates, including two given in this paper. Finally, we extensively discuss possible physical candidates for WDM particles. We find that the most promising are neutrinos with weaker or stronger interactions than normal, majorons (light pseudo-Goldstone bosons), or mirror- or shadow-world neutrinos.},

@article{Dalcanton:2001,
	Abstract = {We explore observed trends in the cores of a wide range of relaxed dark matter-dominated halos (about 7 orders of magnitude in mass) to constrain hypothetical dark matter candidates and scenarios of structure formation. First, we argue that neither generic warm dark matter (collisionless or collisional) nor self-interacting dark matter can be responsible for the observed cores on all scales. Both scenarios predict smaller cores for higher mass systems, in conflict with observations; some cores must instead have a dynamical origin. Second, we show that the mean core phase-space densities Q of dwarf spheroidal galaxies, rotating dwarf and low surface brightness galaxies, and clusters of galaxies decrease with increasing velocity dispersion like Q~sigma-3~M-1, as predicted by a simple scaling argument based on quietly merging equilibrium systems over a range of about 8 orders of magnitude in Q. We discuss the processes that set the overall normalization of the observed phase density hierarchy. We note the resemblance between the observed phase-space scaling behavior and density profiles of dark matter halos and stellar components in elliptical galaxies and conjecture that dark matter halos may suffer from the same systematic departures from homology as seen in elliptical galaxies, thus explaining the shallower density profiles observed in low-mass halos. Finally, we use the maximum observed phase-space density in dwarf spheroidal galaxies to fix a minimum mass for relativistically decoupled warm dark matter candidates of roughly 700 eV for thermal fermions and 300 eV for degenerate fermions.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the effects of alpha-element enhancement and the thermally pulsing-asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) stars on the surface brightness fluctuation (SBF) magnitudes and broadband colors of simple stellar populations and compare to the empirical calibrations. We consider a broad range of ages and metallicities using the recently updated Teramo BaSTI isochrones. We find that the alpha-element-enhanced I-band SBF magnitudes are about 0.35 mag brighter and their integrated V - I colors are about 0.02 mag redder, mostly because of oxygen-enhancement effects on the upper red giant branch and AGB. We also demonstrate, using both the Teramo BaSTI and Padova isochrones, the acute sensitivity of SBF magnitudes to the presence of TP-AGB stars, particularly in the near-IR, but in the I band as well. Empirical SBF trends therefore hold great promise for constraining this important but still highly uncertain stage of stellar evolution. In a similar vein, non-negligible disparities are found among several different models available in the literature due to intrinsic model uncertainties.},

@article{Young:2008,
	Abstract = {Since Baade's photographic study of M32 in the mid 1940s, it has been accepted as an established fact that M32 is a compact dwarf satellite of M31. The purpose of this paper is to report on the findings of our investigation into the nature of the existing evidence. We find that the case for M32 being a satellite of M31 rests upon Hubble Space Telescope (HST) based stellar population studies which have resolved red-giant branch (RGB) and red clump stars in M32 as well as other nearby galaxies. Taken in isolation, this recent evidence could be considered to be conclusive in favour of the existing view. However, the conventional scenario does not explain M32's anomalously high central velocity dispersion for a dwarf galaxy (several times that of either NGC 147, NGC 185 or NGC 205) or existing planetary nebula observations (which suggest that M32 is more than twice as distant as M31) and also requires an elaborate physical explanation for M32's inferred compactness. Conversely, we find that the case for M32 being a normal galaxy, of the order of three times as distant as M31, is supported by: (1) a central velocity dispersion typical of intermediate galaxies, (2) the published planetary nebula observations, and (3) known scaling relationships for normal early-type galaxies. However, this novel scenario cannot account for the high apparent luminosities of the RGB stars resolved in the M32 direction by HST observations. We are therefore left with two apparently irreconcilable scenarios, only one of which can be correct, but both of which suffer from potentially fatal evidence to the contrary. This suggests that current understanding of some relevant fields is still very far from adequate.},

@article{Liu:2000,
	Abstract = {We compute theoretical predictions for surface brightness fluctuations (SBFs) of single-burst stellar populations (SSPs) using models optimized for this purpose. We present results over a wide range of ages (from 1 to 17 Gyr) and metallicities (from 1/200 to 2.5 times solar) and for a comprehensive set of ground-based and space-based optical and infrared bandpasses. Our models agree well with existing SBF observations of Milky Way globular clusters and elliptical galaxies. Our results also provide refined theoretical calibrations and k-corrections that are needed to use SBFs as standard candles. We suggest that SBF distance measurements can be improved by (1) using a filter around 1 mum to minimize the influence of stellar population variations, and (2) using the integrated V-K galaxy color instead of V-Ic to calibrate I-band SBF distances. In addition, we show that available SBF observations set useful constraints on current population synthesis models, and we suggest SBF-based tests for future models. The existing SBF data favor particular choices of stellar evolutionary tracks and spectral libraries among the several choices allowed by comparisons based on only the integrated properties of galaxies. Also, the tightness of the empirical I-band SBF calibration as a function of V-Ic galaxy color is a useful constraint. It suggests that the model uncertainties in the lifetimes of the post-main-sequence evolutionary phases are probably less than +/-50% and that the initial mass function in elliptical galaxies is probably not much steeper than that in the solar neighborhood. Finally, we analyze the potential of SBFs for probing unresolved stellar populations in elliptical galaxies. Since SBFs depend on the second moment of the stellar luminosity function, they are sensitive to the brightest giant stars and provide complementary information to commonly used integrated light and spectra. In particular, we find that optical/near-infrared SBFs are much more sensitive to the metallicity than the age of a stellar population. Therefore, in combination with age-sensitive observables, SBF magnitudes and colors are a valuable complement to metal-line indices to break the age/metallicity degeneracy in elliptical galaxy studies. Our preliminary results suggest that the most luminous stellar populations of bright galaxies in nearby clusters have roughly solar metallicities and about a factor of 3 spread in age.},

While several past articles have included some review material, this is the first intended as a comprehensive review of the surface brightness fluctuation (SBF) method. The method is conceptually quite simple, the basic idea being that nearby (but unresolved) star clusters and galaxies appear "bumpy", while more distant ones appear smooth. This is quantified via a measurement of the amplitude of the Poisson fluctuations in the number of unresolved stars encompassed by a CCD pixel (usually in an image of an elliptical galaxy). Here, we describe the technical details and difficulties involved in making SBF measurements, discuss theoretical and empirical calibrations of the method, and review the numerous applications of the method from the ground and space, in the optical and near-infrared. We include discussions of stellar population effects and the "universality" of the SBF standard candle. A final section considers the future of the method.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the use of surface brightness fluctuations (SBF) measurements in optical and near-IR bandpasses for both stellar population and distance studies. New V-band SBF data are reported for five galaxies in the Fornax cluster and combined with literature data to define a V-band SBF distance indicator, calibrated against Cepheid distances to the Leo group and the Virgo and Fornax clusters. The colour dependence of the V-band SBF indicator is only ~15 per cent steeper than that found for the I band, and the mean `fluctuation colour' of the galaxies is <V-I>~2.4. We use new stellar population models, based on the latest Padua isochrones transformed empirically to the observational plane, to predict optical and near-IR SBF magnitudes and integrated colours for a wide range of population ages and metallicities. We examine the sensitivity of the predicted SBF-colour relations to changes in the isochrones, stellar transformations, and initial mass function. The new models reproduce fairly well the weak dependence of V and I SBF in globular clusters on metallicity, especially if the more metal-rich globulars are younger. Below solar metallicity, the near-IR SBF magnitudes depend mainly on age, while the integrated colours depend mainly on metallicity. This could prove a powerful new approach to the age-metallicity degeneracy problem; near-IR SBF observations of globular clusters would be an important test of the models. The models also help in understanding the (V-I) and (I-K) fluctuation colours of elliptical galaxies, with much less need for composite stellar populations than in previous models. However, in order to obtain theoretical calibrations of the SBF distance indicators, we combine the homogeneous population models into composite models and select out those ones with fluctuation colours consistent with observations. We are able to reproduce the observed range of elliptical galaxy (V-I) colours, the slopes of the V and I SBF distance indicators against (V-I) (fainter SBF in redder populations), and the flattening of the I-band relation for (V-I)<~1.0. The models also match the observed slope of I-band SBF against the Mg2 absorption index and explain the steep colour dependence found by Ajhar et al. for the HST/WFPC2 F814W-band SBF measurements. In contrast to previous models, ours predict that the near-IR SBF magnitudes will also continue to grow fainter for redder populations. The theoretical V-band SBF zero-point predicted by these models agrees well with the Cepheid-calibrated V-band empirical zero-point. However, the model zero-point is 0.15-0.27mag too faint in the I band and 0.24-0.36mag too faint in K. The zero-points for the I band (empirically the best determined) would come into close agreement if the Cepheid distance scale were revised to agree with the recent dynamical distance measured to NGC 4258. We note that the theoretical SBF calibrations are sensitive to the uncertain details of stellar evolution, and conclude that the empirical calibrations remain more secure. However, the sensitivity of SBF to these finer details potentially makes it a powerful, relatively unexploited, constraint for stellar evolution and population synthesis.},

	Abstract = {We present spectra of AGB stars in M31 for which observations had been previously secured using a four-band photometric system (FBPS). The FBPS had been used to identify M-, S-, and carbon-star (C-star) candidates, and we use the spectra to show that the FBPS did an excellent job at identifying C- and M-stars. Of the 48 C-stars for which spectra were obtained, 7 have strongly enhanced ^13^C bands (J-stars), 2 have strong Halpha emission, while 3 are found to exhibit enhanced Li absorption (Li-stars). Both the J- and Li-stars are fainter than predicted by current theoretical models, while the colors of the Halpha stars suggest they may be in the terminal phases of their evolution. The C_2_ and CN bandstrengths of the C-stars are measured, and no correlation between these bandstrengths and either M_bol_ or (V-I) is found. It is suggested that this lack of correlation is due to an age spread. The spectra of the first confirmed S-star in M31 is presented, and two evolutionary pathways are suggested to account for this star's high luminosity.},

	Abstract = {This Letter reports on the Galactic stellar structures that appear in the foreground of our Canada-France-Hawaii-Telecopse/MegaCam survey of the halo of the Andromeda galaxy. We recover the main sequence and main-sequence turnoff of the Triangulum-Andromeda structure recently found by Majewski and collaborators at a heliocentric distance of ~20 kpc. The survey also reveals another less populated main sequence at fainter magnitudes that could correspond to a more distant stellar structure at ~28 kpc. Both structures are smoothly distributed over the ~76 deg2 covered by the survey, although the closer one shows an increase in density by a factor of ~2 toward the northwest. The discovery of a stellar structure behind the Triangulum-Andromeda structure that itself appears behind the low-latitude stream that surrounds the Galactic disk gives further evidence that the inner halo of the Milky Way is of a spatially clumpy nature.  Based on observations obtained with MegaPrime/MegaCam, a joint project of CFHT and CEA/DAPNIA, at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT), which is operated by the National Research Council (NRC) of Canada, the Institut National des Science de l'Univers of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) of France, and the University of Hawaii.},

	Abstract = {We use data from the Isaac Newton Telescope Wide-Field Camera survey of M31 to determine the surface brightness profile of M31 along the southeast minor axis. We combine surface photometry and faint red giant branch star counts to trace the profile from the innermost regions out to a projected radius of 4$\,^{\circ}$ (~55 kpc), where muV~32 mag arcsec-2 this is the first time the M31 minor-axis profile has been mapped over such a large radial distance using a single data set. We confirm the finding by Pritchet & van den Bergh that the minor-axis profile can be described by a single de Vaucouleurs law out to a projected radius of 1.4d or ~20 kpc. Beyond this, the surface brightness profile flattens considerably and is consistent with either a power law of index about -2.3 or an exponential of scale length 14 kpc. The fraction of the total M31 luminosity contained in this component is ~2.5%. While it is tempting to associate this outer component with a true Population II halo in M31, we find that the mean color of the stellar population remains roughly constant at V-i~1.6 from 0.5d to 3.5d along the minor axis. This result suggests that the same metal-rich stellar population dominates both structural components.

We provide here new relations to estimate the TIR luminosity from various Spitzer bands, in particular from the 8 micron and 24 micron bands. To do so, we use 45" subregions within a subsample of nearby face-on spiral galaxies from the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey (SINGS) that have known oxygen abundances as well as integrated galaxy data from the SINGS, the Local Volume Legacy Survey (LVL) and Engelbracht et al. (2008) samples. Taking into account the oxygen abundances of the subregions, the star formation rate intensity, and the relative emission of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons at 8 micron, the warm dust at 24 micron and the cold dust at 70 micron and 160 micron we derive new relations to estimate the TIR luminosity from just one or two of the Spitzer bands. We also show that the metallicity and the star formation intensity must be taken into account when estimating the TIR luminosity from two wave bands, especially when data longward of 24 micron are not available.},

	Abstract = {Modern population synthesis models estimate that 50% of the restframe K-band light is produced by TP-AGB stars during the first Gyr of a stellar population, with a substantial fraction continuing to be produced by the TP-AGB over a Hubble time. Between 0.2 and 1.5 Gyr, intermediate mass stars evolve into TP-AGB C stars which, due to significant amounts of circumstellar dust, emit half their energy in the mid-IR. We combine these results using published mid-IR colors of Galactic TP-AGB M and C stars to construct simple models for exploring the contribution of the TP-AGB to 24micron data as a function of stellar population age. We compare these empirical models with an ensemble of galaxies in the CDFS from z=0 to z=2, and with high quality imaging in M81. Within the uncertainties, the TP-AGB appears responsible for a substantial fraction of the mid-IR luminosities of galaxies from z=0 to z=2, the maximum redshift to which we can test our hypothesis, while, at the same time, our models reproduce much of the detailed structure observed in mid-IR imaging of M81. The mid-IR is a good diagnostic of star formation over timescales of ~1.5 Gyr, but this implies that on-going star formation rates at z=1 may be overestimated by factors of ~1.5-6, depending on the nature of star formation events. Our results, if confirmed through subsequent work, have strong implications for the star formation rate density of the universe and the growth of stellar mass over time.},

	Abstract = {We present photometry of 104 M31 globular clusters (GCs) and GC candidates in 15 intermediate-band filters of the Beijing-Arizona-Taiwan-Connecticut photometric system. The GCs and GC candidates were selected from the Revised Bologna Catalog (v.3.5). We obtain the cluster ages by comparing the photometric data with up-to-date theoretical synthesis models. The photometric data used are Galaxy Evolution Explorer far- and near-ultraviolet and Two Micron All Sky Survey near-infrared JHK s magnitudes, combined with optical photometry. The ages of our sample clusters cover a large range, although most clusters are younger than 10 Gyr. Combined with the ages obtained in our series of previous papers focusing on the M31 GC system, we present the full M31 GC age distribution. The M31 GC system contains populations of young and intermediate-age GCs, as well as the "usual" complement of well-known old GCs, i.e., GCs of similar age as the majority of the Galactic GCs. In addition, young GCs (and GC candidates) are distributed nearly uniformly in radial distance from the center of M31, while most old GCs (and GC candidates) are more strongly concentrated.},

	Abstract = {We add a singlet right handed neutrino plus a charged and a neutral singlet scalars to the standard model. This extension includes a discrete symmetry such that we obtain a heavy sterile neutrino which couples only to the electron and the new scalars. In this sense the singlet neutrino does not mix with ordinary ones and thus has no effect on Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. However, such sterile neutrino can be in equilibrium with electroweak particles in the early Universe due to its couplings to electrons and also because the Higgs boson mixes with the singlet scalars. We obtain that the sterile neutrino constitutes a dark matter candidate and analyze its direct detection in the light of current experiments. Our results show that if such a sterile neutrino is realized in nature, and CDMS-II experiment confirms its positive signal, dark matter demands a rather light Higgs boson with new Physics at some 500 GeV scale.},

	Abstract = {The nature of the dark matter critically affects the large-scale structure of the universe. Under the assumptions that the universe is spatially flat with zero cosmological constant and that primordial perturbations were adiabatic with a Harrison-Zeldovich spectrum, neither hot dark matter (HDM) nor cold dark matter (CDM) appears consistent with the observed large-scale structure. Warm dark matter (WDM) is an intriguing alternative from the point of view of both cosmology and particle physics.   We consider a one-parameter family of WDM models. The linear power spectra for these models is calculated and compared with the corresponding spectra for CDM, HDM, and mixed dark matter (MDM), as well as the power spectrum derived from observations. Our linear analyses suggest that a model universe dominated by a particle whose mass-to-temperature ratio mx/Tx is increased by a factor of 2 as compared with the standard HDM neutrino gives a reasonable fit to the data on large (>8 h-1 Mpc) scales.  N-body simulations for this particular WDM model show features of both HDM and CDM. As in HDM, the first objects to collapse are large pancake-like structures. The final matter distribution is rather smooth, and structures as small as galaxy halos are excluded. However, there appear to be virialized rich clusters evident in the CDM but not in the HDM simulations. Unfortunately, a simple comparison of the matter distribution and its statistical properties with observations indicates that WDM, like CDM, has too much power at small scales. This is particularly evident in the small-scale pairwise velocity dispersion. The cluster multiplicity function has the wrong shape, with too many rich clusters being produced, although this conclusion is based on the simple assumption that light traces mass in groups of galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We propose a new and unique dark matter candidate: ~100 eV to ~10 keV sterile neutrinos produced via lepton-number-driven resonant Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein conversion of active neutrinos. The requisite lepton number asymmetries in any of the active neutrino flavors range from 10-3 to 10-1 of the photon number. The unique feature here is that the adiabaticity condition of the resonance strongly favors the production of lower energy sterile neutrinos. The resulting nonthermal (cold) energy spectrum can cause these sterile neutrinos to revert to nonrelativistic kinematics at an early epoch, so that free-streaming lengths at or below the dwarf galaxy scale are possible. Therefore, the main problem associated with light neutrino dark matter can be circumvented in our model.},

The constraints considered here include energy loss in core collapse supernovae, energy density limits at big bang nucleosynthesis, and those stemming from sterile neutrino decay: limits from observed cosmic microwave background anisotropies, diffuse extragalactic background radiation, and 6Li/D overproduction. Our calculations explicitly include matter effects, both effective mixing angle suppression and enhancement (MSW resonance), as well as quantum damping. We for the first time properly include all finite temperature effects, dilution resulting from the annihilation or disappearance of relativistic degrees of freedom, and the scattering-rate-enhancing effects of particle-antiparticle pairs (muons, tauons, quarks) at high temperature in the early universe.},

The minimal production scenario with a standard thermal history and negligible cosmological lepton number is in conflict with conservative radiative decay constraints from the cosmic X-ray background in combination with stringent small-scale structure limits from the Lyman-alpha forest. We show that entropy release through massive particle decay after production does not alleviate these constraints. We further show that radiative decay constraints from local group dwarf galaxies are subject to large uncertainties in the dark matter density profile of these systems. Within the strongest set of constraints, resonant production of cold sterile neutrino dark matter in nonzero lepton number cosmologies remains allowed.},

	Abstract = {Sterile neutrino with mass of several keV can be the cosmological dark matter, can explain the observed velocities of pulsars, and can play an important role in the formation of the first stars. We describe the production of sterile neutrinos in a model with an extended Higgs sector, in which the Majorana mass term is generated by the vacuum expectation value of a gauge-singlet Higgs boson. In this model the relic abundance of sterile neutrinos does not necessarily depend on their mixing angles, the free-streaming length can be much smaller than in the case of warm dark matter produced by neutrino oscillations, and, therefore, some of the previously quoted bounds do not apply. The presence of the gauge singlet in the Higgs sector has important implications for the electroweak phase transition, baryogenesis, and the upcoming experiments at the Large Hadron Collider and a Linear Collider.},

	Abstract = {The identity of dark matter is a question of central importance in both astrophysics and particle physics. In the past, the leading particle candidates were cold and collisionless, and typically predicted missing energy signals at particle colliders. However, recent progress has greatly expanded the list of well-motivated candidates and the possible signatures of dark matter. This review begins with a brief summary of the standard model of particle physics and its outstanding problems. We then discuss several dark matter candidates motivated by these problems, including WIMPs, superWIMPs, light gravitinos, hidden dark matter, sterile neutrinos, and axions. For each of these, we critically examine the particle physics motivations and present their expected production mechanisms, basic properties, and implications for direct and indirect detection, particle colliders, and astrophysical observations. Upcoming experiments will discover or exclude many of these candidates, and progress may open up an era of unprecedented synergy between studies of the largest and smallest observable length scales.},

	Abstract = {The discovery of neutrino masses suggests the likely existence of gauge singlet fermions that participate in the neutrino mass generation via the seesaw mechanism. The masses of the corresponding degrees of freedom can range from well below the electroweak scale to the Planck scale. If some of the singlet fermions are light, the sterile neutrinos appear in the low-energy effective theory. They can play an important role in astrophysics and cosmology. In particular, sterile neutrinos with masses of several keV can account for cosmological dark matter, which can be relatively warm or cold, depending on the production mechanism. The same particles can explain the observed velocities of pulsars because of the anisotropy in their emission from a cooling neutron star born in a supernova explosion. Decays of the relic sterile neutrinos can produce a flux of X-rays that can affect the formation of the first stars. Existing and future X-ray telescopes can be used to search for the relic sterile neutrinos.},

	Abstract = {We revisit the well known discrepancy between the observed number of Milky Way (MW) dwarf satellite companions and the predicted population of cold dark matter (CDM) subhalos, in light of the dozen new low-luminosity satellites found in imaging data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and our recent calibration of the SDSS satellite detection efficiency, which implies a total satellite population far larger than these dozen discoveries. We combine a detailed dynamical model for the CDM subhalo population with simple, physically motivated prescriptions for assigning a stellar content to each subhalo, then apply observational selection effects and compare to the current observational census. Reconciling the observed satellite population with CDM predictions still requires strong mass-dependent suppression of star formation in low-mass subhalos: models in which the stellar mass is a constant fraction F *(Omega b /Omega m ) of the subhalo mass M sat at the time it becomes a satellite fail for any choice of F *. However, previously advocated models that invoke suppression of gas accretion after reionization in halos with circular velocity V circ <= V crit ≈ 35 km s-1 can reproduce the observed satellite counts for -15 <= MV <= 0. Successful models require F * ≈ 10-3 in halos with V circ>V crit and strong suppression of star formation before reionization in halos with V circ lsim 10 km s-1 models without pre-reionization suppression predict far too many satellites with -5 <= MV <= 0. In this successful model, the dominant fraction of stars formed after reionization at all luminosities. Models that match the satellite luminosity distribution also match the observed heliocentric radius distribution, and they reproduce the observed characteristic stellar velocity dispersion sigma* ≈ 5-10 km s-1 of the SDSS dwarfs given the observed sizes (~50-200 pc) of their stellar distributions. The model satellites have M(<300 pc) ~ 107 M sun as observed even though their present-day total halo masses span more than two orders of magnitude; the constancy of central masses mainly reflects the profiles of CDM halos. Our modeling shows that natural physical mechanisms acting within the CDM framework can quantitatively explain the properties of the MW satellite population as it is presently known, thus providing a convincing solution to the "missing satellite" problem.},

	Abstract = {We revisit Lyman-alpha bounds on the dark matter mass in Lambda Warm Dark Matter (LambdaWDM) models, and derive new bounds in the case of mixed Cold plus Warm models (LambdaCWDM), using a set up which is a good approximation for several theoretically well-motivated dark matter models. We combine WMAP5 results with two different Lyman-alpha data sets, including observations from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We pay a special attention to systematics, test various possible sources of error, and compare the results of different statistical approaches. Expressed in terms of the mass of a non-resonantly produced sterile neutrino, our bounds read mNRP >= 8 keV (frequentist 99.7% confidence limit) or mNRP >= 12.1 keV (Bayesian 95% credible interval) in the pure LambdaWDM limit. For the mixed model, we obtain limits on the mass as a function of the warm dark matter fraction FWDM. Within the mass range studied here (5 keV < mNRP < ∞), we find that any mass value is allowed when FWDM < 0.6 (frequentist 99.7% confidence limit); similarly, the Bayesian joint probability on (FWDM, 1/mNRP) allows any value of the mass at the 95% confidence level, provided that FWDM < 0.35.},

We focus on fitting the angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) in detail which is possible using a flat Universe with and the usual baryonic and dark energy components. One cannot match the CMB if there is more than one massive sterile neutrino, nor with three active neutrinos of 2eV. This model has the same expansion history as the Lambda cold dark matter (LambdaCDM) model and only differs at the galactic scale, where the modified dynamics outperform LambdaCDM comprehensively. We discuss how an 11eV sterile neutrino can explain the dark matter of galaxy clusters without influencing individual galaxies and potentially match the matter power spectrum.},

@article{Berne:2010,
	Abstract = {Mid-infrared astronomy (operating at wavelengths ranging from 2 to 25 $\mu$m) has progressed significantly in the last decades, thanks to the improvement of detector techniques and the growing diameter of telescopes. Space observatories benefit from the absence of atmospheric absorption, allowing to reach the very high sensitivities needed to perform 3D hyperspectral observations, but telescopes are limited in diameter ($< 1$ meter) and therefore provide observations at low angular resolution (typically a few seconds of arc). On the other hand, ground-based facilities suffer from strong atmospheric absorption but use large telescopes (above 8m diameter) to perform sub-arcsecond angular resolution imaging through selected windows in the mid-infrared range. In this Paper, we present a method based on Lee and Seung's Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to merge data from space and ground based mid-infrared (mid-IR) telescopes in order to combine the best sensitivity, spectral coverage and angular resolution. We prove the efficiency of this technique when applied to real mid-IR astronomical data. We suggest that this method can be applied to any combination of low and high spatial resolution positive hyperspectral datasets, as long as the spectral variety of the data allows decomposition into components using NMF.},

We point out that in a particular variation of the inert doublet model, sterile neutrinos can account for the dark matter in the Universe and may be either cold or warm dark matter candidates, even for masses much larger than the keV range. These Inert-Sterile neutrinos, produced non-thermally in the early Universe, would be stable and have very small couplings to Standard Model particles, rendering very difficult their detection in either direct or indirect dark matter searches.

	Abstract = {We present a family of robust tracer mass estimators to compute the enclosed mass of galaxy haloes from samples of discrete positional and kinematical data of tracers, such as halo stars, globular clusters and dwarf satellites. The data may be projected positions, distances, line of sight velocities or proper motions. Forms of the estimator tailored for the Milky Way galaxy and for M31 are given. Monte Carlo simulations are used to quantify the uncertainty as a function of sample size. For the Milky Way, the satellite sample consists of 26 galaxies with line-of-sight velocities. We find that the mass of the Milky Way within 300 kpc is ~ 0.9 x 10^12 solar masses assuming velocity isotropy. However, the mass estimate is sensitive to the anisotropy and could plausibly lie between 0.7 - 3.4 x 10^12 solar masses. Incorporating the proper motions of 6 Milky Way satellites into the dataset, we find ~ 1.4 x 10^12 solar masses. The range here if plausible anisotropies are used is still broader, from 1.2 - 2.7 x 10^12 solar masses. For M31, there are 23 satellite galaxies with measured line-of-sight velocities, but only M33 and IC 10 have proper motions. We use the line of sight velocities and distances of the satellite galaxies to estimate the mass of M31 within 300 kpc as ~ 1.4 x 10^12 solar masses assuming isotropy. There is only a modest dependence on anisotropy, with the mass varying between 1.3 -1.6 x 10^12 solar masses. Given the uncertainties, we conclude that the satellite data by themselves yield no reliable insights into which of the two galaxies is actually the more massive.},

It is shown that density perturbation spectrum of gravitinos is relatively flat between galactic and cluster scales, unlike the massive neutrino case. If gravitinos form the dark matter, initial adiabatic fluctuations lead to a hierarchical picture of clustering. Galaxies form first, but dissipation is necessary for their survival.},

	Abstract = {The large-scale cosmic background anisotropy detected by the COBE Differential Microwave Radiometer (DMR) instrument is compared to the sensitive previous measurements on various angular scales, and to the predictions of a wide variety of models of structure formation driven by gravitational instability. The observed anisotropy is consistent with all previously measured upper limits and with a number of dynamical models of structure formation. For example, the data agree with an unbiased cold dark matter (CDM) model with H0 = 50 km/s Mpc and Delta-M/M = 1 in a 16 Mpc radius sphere. Other models, such as CDM plus massive neutrinos (hot dark matter (HDM)), or CDM with a nonzero cosmological constant are also consistent with the COBE detection and can provide the extra power seen on 5-10,000 km/s scales.},

	Abstract = {It is argued here that the success of the cosmological cold dark matter (CDM) model can be retained and the new observations of very large scale cosmological structures can be accommodated in a spatially flat cosmology in which as much as 80 percent of the critical density is provided by a positive cosmological constant. In such a universe, expansion was dominated by CDM until a recent epoch, but is now governed by the cosmological constant. This constant can also account for the lack of fluctuations in the microwave background and the large number of certain kinds of objects found at high redshift.},

	Abstract = {The cold dark matter (CDM) theory of the formation of structure in the universe has suffered recent setbacks from observational evidence which suggests that there is more large-scale structure than CDM can explain. This evidence may force a fundamental revision or even abandonment of the theory or may simply reflect a modulation of the galaxy distribution by processes associated with galaxy formation. Better understanding of galaxy formation is needed before the demise of CDM is declared.},

	Abstract = {The simplest model that can accommodate a viable nonbaryonic dark matter candidate is the standard electroweak theory with the addition of right-handed (sterile) neutrinos. We consider a single generation of neutrinos with a Dirac mass mu and a Majorana mass M for the right-handed component. If M>>mu (standard hot dark matter corresponds to M=0), then sterile neutrinos are produced via oscillations in the early Universe with energy density independent of M. However, M is crucial in determining the large scale structure of the Universe; for M~100 eV, sterile neutrinos make an excellent warm dark matter candidate.},

	Abstract = {We present radial velocities for a sample of 723 planetary nebulae in the disc and bulge of M31, measured using the WYFFOS fibre spectrograph on the William Herschel Telescope. Velocities are determined using the [OIII]lambda5007 emission line. Rotation and velocity dispersion are measured to a radius of 50arcmin (11.5kpc), the first stellar rotation curve and velocity dispersion profile for M31 to such a radius. Our kinematics are consistent with rotational support at radii well beyond the bulge effective radius of 1.4kpc, although our data beyond a radius of 5kpc are limited. We present tentative evidence for kinematic substructure in the bulge of M31 to be studied fully in a later work. This paper is part of an ongoing project to constrain the total mass, mass distribution and velocity anisotropy of the disc, bulge and halo of M31.},

The all GC system shows strong rotation, with rotation amplitude of vrot~190 km s-1, and weak rotation persists even for the outermost samples at |Y|>=5 kpc, where Y represents the projected distance from the major axis. The rotation-corrected velocity dispersion for the GC system is estimated to be sigmap,r~130 km s-1, and it increases from sigmap,r~120 km s-1 at |Y|<1 kpc to sigmap,r~150 km s-1 at |Y|>=5 kpc. These results are very similar to those for the metal-poor GCs. This shows that there is a dynamically hot halo in M31 that is rotating but primarily pressure-supported. We have identified 50 ``friendless'' GCs, and they appear to rotate around the major axis of M31. Both metal-rich GCs and metal-poor GCs show strong rotation in the inner region. The rotation for the faint GCs is stronger than that for the bright GCs. We have identified 56 GCs and GC candidates with X-ray detection including 39 GCs with measured velocities. The majority of X-ray-emitting GCs follow the disk rotation. We have derived a rotation curve of M31 using the GCs at |Y|<=0.6 kpc. We have estimated the dynamical mass of M31 using ``Projected Mass Estimator (PME)'' and ``Tracer Mass Estimator (TME)'' as MPME=5.5+0.4-0.3×1011 Msolar out to a radius of ~55 kpc and MTME=19.2+1.4-1.3×1011 Msolar for a radius of ~100 kpc, respectively. We finally discuss the implication of these results and compare the kinematics of GCs with that of planetary nebulae in M31.

	Abstract = {We present a catalogue of positions, magnitudes and velocities for 3300 emission-line objects found by the Planetary Nebula Spectrograph in a survey of the Andromeda galaxy, M31. Of these objects, 2615 are found likely to be planetary nebulae (PNe) associated with M31. The survey area covers the whole of M31's disc out to a radius of . Beyond this radius, observations have been made along the major and minor axes, and the Northern Spur and Southern Stream regions. The calibrated data have been checked for internal consistency and compared with other catalogues. With the exception of the very central, high surface brightness region of M31, this survey is complete to a magnitude limit of m5007 ~ 23.75, 3.5 mag into the PN luminosity function.  We have identified emission-line objects associated with M31's satellites and other background galaxies. We have examined the data from the region tentatively identified as a new satellite galaxy, Andromeda VIII, comparing it to data in the other quadrants of the galaxy. We find that the PNe in this region have velocities that appear to be consistent with membership of M31 itself.  The luminosity function of the surveyed PNe is well matched to the usual smooth monotonic function. The only significant spatial variation in the luminosity function occurs in the vicinity of M31's molecular ring, where the luminosities of PNe on the near side of the galaxy are systematically ~0.2 mag fainter than those on the far side. This difference can be explained naturally by a modest amount of obscuration by the ring. The absence of any difference in luminosity function between bulge and disc suggests that the sample of PNe is not strongly populated by objects whose progenitors are more massive stars. This conclusion is reinforced by the excellent agreement between the number counts of PNe and the R-band light.  The number counts of kinematically selected PNe also allow us to probe the stellar distribution in M31 down to very faint limits. There is no indication of a cut-off in M31's disc out to beyond four scalelengths, and no signs of a spheroidal halo population in excess of the bulge out to 10 effective bulge radii.  We have also carried out a preliminary analysis of the kinematics of the surveyed PNe. The mean streaming velocity of the M31 disc PNe is found to show a significant asymmetric drift out to large radii. Their velocity dispersion, although initially declining with radius, flattens out to a constant value in the outer parts of the galaxy. There are no indications that the disc velocity dispersion varies with PN luminosity, once again implying that the progenitors of PNe of all magnitudes form a relatively homogeneous old population. The dispersion profile and asymmetric drift results are shown to be mutually consistent, but require that the disc flares with radius if the shape of its velocity ellipsoid remains invariant.},

	Abstract = {The Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) 5-year data provide stringent limits on deviations from the minimal, six-parameter Lambda cold dark matter model. We report these limits and use them to constrain the physics of cosmic inflation via Gaussianity, adiabaticity, the power spectrum of primordial fluctuations, gravitational waves, and spatial curvature. We also constrain models of dark energy via its equation of state, parity-violating interaction, and neutrino properties, such as mass and the number of species. We detect no convincing deviations from the minimal model. The six parameters and the corresponding 68% uncertainties, derived from the WMAP data combined with the distance measurements from the Type Ia supernovae (SN) and the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) in the distribution of galaxies, are: Omega b  h 2 = 0.02267+0.00058 -0.00059, Omega c  h 2 = 0.1131 $\pm$ 0.0034, OmegaLambda = 0.726 $\pm$ 0.015, ns = 0.960 $\pm$ 0.013, tau = 0.084 $\pm$ 0.016, and \Delta _{\cal R}^2 = (2.445\pm 0.096)\times 10^{-9} at k = 0.002 Mpc-1. From these, we derive sigma8 = 0.812 $\pm$ 0.026, H 0 = 70.5 $\pm$ 1.3 km s-1 Mpc-1, Omega b  = 0.0456 $\pm$ 0.0015, Omega c  = 0.228 $\pm$ 0.013, Omega m  h 2 = 0.1358+0.0037 -0.0036, z reion = 10.9 $\pm$ 1.4, and t 0 = 13.72 $\pm$ 0.12 Gyr. With the WMAP data combined with BAO and SN, we find the limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of r < 0.22(95%CL), and that ns > 1 is disfavored even when gravitational waves are included, which constrains the models of inflation that can produce significant gravitational waves, such as chaotic or power-law inflation models, or a blue spectrum, such as hybrid inflation models. We obtain tight, simultaneous limits on the (constant) equation of state of dark energy and the spatial curvature of the universe: -0.14 < 1 + w < 0.12(95%CL) and -0.0179 < Omega k  < 0.0081(95%CL). We provide a set of "WMAP distance priors," to test a variety of dark energy models with spatial curvature. We test a time-dependent w with a present value constrained as -0.33 < 1 + w 0 < 0.21 (95% CL). Temperature and dark matter fluctuations are found to obey the adiabatic relation to within 8.9% and 2.1% for the axion-type and curvaton-type dark matter, respectively. The power spectra of TB and EB correlations constrain a parity-violating interaction, which rotates the polarization angle and converts E to B. The polarization angle could not be rotated more than -5fdg9 < Deltaalpha < 2fdg4 (95% CL) between the decoupling and the present epoch. We find the limit on the total mass of massive neutrinos of ∑m nu < 0.67 eV(95%CL), which is free from the uncertainty in the normalization of the large-scale structure data. The number of relativistic degrees of freedom (dof), expressed in units of the effective number of neutrino species, is constrained as N eff = 4.4 $\pm$ 1.5 (68%), consistent with the standard value of 3.04. Finally, quantitative limits on physically-motivated primordial non-Gaussianity parameters are -9 < f local NL < 111 (95% CL) and -151 < f equil NL < 253 (95% CL) for the local and equilateral models, respectively.

	Abstract = {Combining Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations and accurate 2D bulge/disc decompositions, we present a new study to investigate the effects of dust attenuation on the apparent structural properties of the disc and bulge of spiral galaxies. We find that dust affects the results from such decompositions in ways which cannot be identified when one studies dust effects on bulge and disc components separately. In particular, the effects of dust in galaxies hosting pseudo-bulges might be different from those in galaxies hosting classical bulges, even if their dust content is identical. Confirming previous results, we find that disc scale lengths are overestimated when dust effects are important. In addition, we also find that bulge effective radii and Sersic indices are underestimated. Furthermore, the apparent attenuation of the integrated disc light is underestimated, whereas the corresponding attenuation of bulge light is overestimated. Dust effects are more significant for the bulge parameters, and, combined, they lead to a strong underestimation of the bulge-to-disc ratio, which can reach a factor of two in the V band, even at relatively low galaxy inclinations and dust opacities. Nevertheless, it never reaches factors larger than about three, which corresponds to a factor of two in bulge-to-total ratio. Such effect can have an impact on studies of the black hole/bulge scaling relations.},

	Abstract = {(Abridged) We assemble a sample of 3258 low-redshift galaxies from the SDSS DR6 with complementary photometric observations by GALEX, 2MASS and IRAS at far-ultraviolet and infrared wavelengths. We use a recent, simple but physically motivated model to interpret the observed spectral energy distributions of the galaxies in this sample in terms of statistical constraints on physical parameters describing the star formation history and dust content. The focus on a subsample of 1658 galaxies with highest S/N observations enables us to investigate most clearly several strong correlations between various derived physical properties of galaxies. We find that the typical dust mass of a star-forming correlates remarkably well with the star formation rate (SFR). We also find that the dust-to-stellar mass ratio, the ratio of dust mass to star formation rate and the fraction of dust luminosity contributed by the diffuse interstellar medium all correlate strongly with specific SFR. A comparison with recent models of chemical and dust evolution of galaxies suggests that these correlations could arise, at least in part, from an evolutionary sequence. As galaxies form stars, their ISM becomes enriched in dust, while the drop in gas supply makes the specific SFR decrease. Interestingly, as a result, a young, actively star-forming galaxy with low dust-to-gas ratio may still be highly dusty because it contains large amounts of interstellar gas. This may be important for the interpretation of the infrared emission from young, gas-rich star-forming galaxies at high redshift. Our study provides a useful local reference for future statistical studies of the star formation and dust properties of galaxies at high redshifts.},

	Abstract = {We present a large set of theoretical isochrones, whose distinctive features mostly reside on the greatly-improved treatment of the thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) phase. Essentially, we have coupled the TP-AGB tracks described in Paper I, at their stages of pre-flash quiescent H-shell burning, with the evolutionary tracks for the previous evolutionary phases from Girardi et al. (2000, A&AS, 141, 371). Theoretical isochrones for any intermediate value of age and metallicity are then derived by interpolation in the grids. We take care that the isochrones keep, to a good level of detail, the several peculiarities present in these TP-AGB tracks - e.g., the cool tails of C-type stars owing to the use of proper molecular opacities as convective dredge-up occurs along the TP-AGB; the bell-shaped sequences in the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram for stars with hot-bottom burning; the changes of pulsation mode between fundamental and first overtone; the sudden changes of mean mass-loss rates as the surface chemistry changes from M- to C-type; etc. Theoretical isochrones are then converted to about 20 different photometric systems - including traditional ground-based systems, and those of recent major wide-field surveys such as SDSS, OGLE, DENIS, 2MASS, UKIDSS, etc., - by means of synthetic photometry applied to an updated library of stellar spectra, suitably extended to include C-type stars. Finally, we correct the predicted photometry for the effect of circumstellar dust during the mass-losing stages of the AGB evolution, which allows us to improve the results for the optical-to-infrared systems, and to simulate mid- and far-IR systems such as those of Spitzer and AKARI. We illustrate the most striking properties of these isochrones by means of basic comparisons with observational data for the Milky Way disc and the Magellanic Clouds. Access to the data is provided both via a web repository of static tables (http://stev.oapd.inaf.it/dustyAGB07 and CDS), and via an interactive web interface (http://stev.oapd.inaf.it/cmd), which provides tables for any intermediate value of age and metallicity, for several photometric systems, and for different choices of dust properties.},

	Abstract = {The Local Group galaxies constitute a fundamental step in the definition of cosmic distance scale. Therefore, obtaining accurate distance determinations to the galaxies in the Local Group, and notably to the Andromeda Galaxy (M 31), is essential for determining the age and evolution of the Universe. With this ultimate goal in mind, we started a project of using eclipsing binaries as distance indicators to M 31. Eclipsing binaries have been proved to yield direct and precise distances that are essentially assumption-free. To do so, high-quality photometric and spectroscopic data were needed. As a first step in the project, broad band photometry (in Johnson B and V) was obtained in a region (34'× 34') in the north eastern quadrant of the galaxy over 5 years. The data, containing more than 250 observations per filter, were reduced by means of the so-called difference image analysis technique and the DAOPHOT program. A catalog with 236 238 objects with photometry in both B and V passbands was obtained. The catalog is the deepest (V<25.5 mag) obtained so far in the studied region and it contains 3964 identified variable stars, with 437 eclipsing binaries and 416 Cepheids. The most suitable eclipsing binary candidates for distance determination were selected according to their brightness and from the modelling of the obtained light curves. The resulting sample includes 24 targets with photometric errors around 0.01 mag. Detailed analysis (including spectroscopy) of some 5-10 of these eclipsing systems should result in a distance determination to M 31 with a relative uncertainty of 2-3% and essentially free of systematic errors, thus representing the most accurate and reliable determination to date.},

	Abstract = {We have imaged five 7' x 7' fields in M31 spanning galactocentric radii from 4 to 32 kpc along the SW semi-major axis. The fields were observed through two broadband (V and I) and two narrowband (CN and TiO) filters. The broadband data were used to construct I, (V - I) color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) and, in some of our fields, we found significant numbers of stars in the Cepheid instability strip. A distance modulus for the Cepheids in the middle field was found that agreed well with other values in the literature. The width of the giant branch (GB) in the I, (V-I) CMD of all five fields was investigated, and we show that in four of the fields a likely explanation for the GB width is a combination of both metallicity and mass variations. Using the broadband data, the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) luminosity functions (LFs) were measured in the five fields, and we show that differences exist between these LFs. We speculate on how the different star-forming histories in the fields may lead to the observed AGB LFs and GB widths. Using the narrowband data along with the broadband data we separated the AGB stars into carbon-rich (C) and oxygen-rich (M) type . The carbon stars LFs were used to obtain an estimate for the distance modulus of M31 which agrees with the value derived from Cepheids. The ratio of C- to M-stars (C/M) is believed to be an indicator of gaseous chemical abundance at the time of formation of these stars. We show that the C/M ratio increases smoothly with galactocentric distance, suggesting an inverse correlation with metallicity. This is the first demonstration of this effect within a single extragalactic system. We find that differences in the width of the GB and the AGB LFs do not significantly affect the C/M ratio. We consider the effect of the increasing C/M ratio on the ISM in M31, and cite evidence in favor of a model where the grain composition in M31 is a function of galactocentric distance.},

The large field surveyed allows a reliable foreground estimate of M stars, leading to a C/M ratio of 0.64, when giants as early as M0 are counted. Analysis of the photometric properties of the C star population reveals a narrow MI distribution with a mean MI of -4.69, with a dispersion of +/-0.28.

We found 945 C stars with <I0>=19.94 and sigma=0.47. The surface density of C stars along the major axis of M31 follows an exponential profile with a scale length of 4.85+/-0.35 kpc, in agreement with adopted values for the scale length of the disk population. Our survey partially overlaps with the recently discovered G1 density enhancement by Ferguson et al. We confirm that no AGB star excess is detectable in the surveyed part of the clump. The C/M ratio, along the major axis, is derived over a distance range of 7 kpc. The strong C/M gradient seen contrasts with results of previous studies of the C stars in M31.},

	Abstract = {We present detailed modeling of the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the spiral galaxies NGC 891, NGC 4013 and NGC 5907 in the far-infrared (FIR) and sub-millimeter (submm) wavelengths. The model takes into account the emission of the diffuse dust component, which is heated by the UV and optical radiation field produced by the stars, as well as the emission produced locally in star forming HII complexes. Radiative transfer simulations in the optical bands are used to constrain the stellar and dust geometrical parameters and the dust mass. We find that the submm emission predicted by our model cannot account for the observed fluxes at these wavelengths. Two scenarios that could account for the "missing" submm flux are examined. In the first scenario dust additional to that derived from the optical wavelengths is embedded in the galaxy in the form of a thin disk. This additional dust disk, which is not detectable in the optical and which is associated with the young stellar population, gives rise to additional submm emission, and makes the total flux match the observed values. The other scenario examines the possibility that the average emissivity at submm wavelengths of the dust grains found both in a diffuse component and in denser environments (e.g. molecular gas clouds) is higher than the values widely used in Galactic environments. This enhanced emissivity reproduces the observed FIR and submm fluxes with the dust mass equal to that derived from the optical observations. In the second scenario, we treat the submm emissivity as a free parameter and calculate its nominal value by fitting our model to the observed SED. We find a dust emissivity which is ~ 3 times the often-used values for our Galaxy. Both scenarios can equally well reproduce the observed 850 mum surface brightness for all three galaxies. However, we argue that the scenario of having more dust embedded in a second disk is not supported by the near infrared observations. At 2.16 mum, the model images with a second dust disk reveal a prominent dust lane which is not present in the observations. Thus, the enhanced emissivity at submm wavelengths is a real possibility and the Galactic submillimeter dust emissivity may be underestimated.},

	Abstract = {We use the radiation transfer simulation of Xilouris et al. (\cite{xilouris1999}) to constrain the quantity of dust in three nearby spiral galaxies (NGC 4013, NGC 5907 and NGC 4565). The predicted visual optical depth from the model is compared with the thermal continuum radiation detected from NGC 4013 and NGC 5907 at 850 mum and from NGC 4565 at 1.2 mm. The former is based on SCUBA images of NGC 4013 and NGC 5907, reduced and presented for the first time in this work. The comparison of visual optical depth and 850 mum (1.2 mm) emission yields the emissivity of dust grains in the submillimeter (millimeter) waveband. We infer a value of 1.2 × 104 for the emissivity at 850 mum which is a factor 4 higher than the benchmark, semi-empirical model of Draine & Lee (\cite{draine1984}). At 1.2 mm our values are a factor 1.5 higher than this model. Our estimates are more closely aligned with recent measurements carried out in the laboratory on amorphous carbon and silicate particulates. A comparison between the distribution of 850 mum (1.2 mm) surface brightness and the intensity levels in the 12CO(1-0) and 21 cm lines underlines the spatial association between dust detected in the submillimeter/millimeter waveband and molecular gas clouds. We suggest that the relatively high emissivity values that we derive may be attributable to amorphous, fluffy grains situated in denser gas environments.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the evolution of the opacity of galaxies as a function of redshift, using simple assumptions about the metal and dust enrichment of the gas and the distribution of dust in galaxies. The method presented in this paper uses an iterative procedure to reconstruct the intrinsic star formation rate (SFR) density of galaxies as a function of redshift, by correcting the observed UV emission for the obscuring effects of the dust produced by the star formation itself. Where necessary, gas inflows/outflows are included to dilute/remove the excess of metals produced by the stars for fixed yield. The iterative procedure converges to multiple solutions for the intrinsic SFR density, divided into two basic classes. The first class of solutions predicts a relatively large amount of UV attenuation at high redshift, with A_1500{\AA}=1.9 mag at z~3, and smaller attenuations at low redshift (z<1), with A_2800{\AA}=1.25 mag. The SFR density of this set of solutions is constant for z>~1.2 and declines for z<1.2 it resembles in shape the monolithic collapse scenario for star formation. The second class of solutions predicts relatively low-UV attenuations at high redshift, with A_1500{\AA}=0.75 mag at z~3, and larger attenuations at low redshift, with A_2800{\AA}=1.50 mag at z<1. The SFR density in this case has a peak at z~=1.2. The advantages and shortcomings of both classes are analyzed in the light of available observational constraints, including the opacity of galaxies at 0<=z<=1 and the intensity and spectral energy distribution of the cosmic infrared background from the COBE DIRBE and FIRAS data. We conclude that both classes of models are acceptable within the current uncertainties, but the monolithic collapse class matches the available observations better than the other one. We also investigate the dependence of our solutions on the different model assumptions.},

	Abstract = {The Lyman decrement associated with the cumulative effect of HI in QSO absorption systems along the line of sight provides a distinctive feature for identifying galaxies at z>~2.5. Colour criteria, which are sensitive to the presence of a Lyman continuum break superposed on an otherwise flat UV spectrum, have been shown, through Keck spectroscopy, to successfully identify a substantial population of star-forming galaxies at 3<~z<~3.5. Such objects have proven to be surprisingly elusive in field galaxy redshift surveys; quantification of their surface densities and morphologies is crucial for determining how and when galaxies formed. The Hubble Deep Field (HDF) observations offer the opportunity to exploit the ubiquitous effect of intergalactic absorption and obtain useful statistical constraints on the redshift distribution of galaxies to considerably fainter limits than the current spectroscopic limits. We model the HI cosmic opacity as a function of redshift, including scattering in resonant lines of the Lyman series and Lyman continuum absorption, and use stellar population synthesis models with a wide variety of ages, metallicities, dust contents and redshifts to derive colour selection criteria that provide a robust separation between high-redshift and low-redshift galaxies. From the HDF images we construct a sample of star-forming galaxies at 2<~z<~4.5. While none of the ~60 objects in the HDF having known Keck/Low-Resolution Imaging Spectrograph (LRIS) spectroscopic redshifts in the range 0<~z<~1.4 is found to contaminate our high-redshift sample, our colour criteria are able to efficiently select the 2.6<~z<~3.2 galaxies identified by Steidel et al. The ultraviolet (and blue) dropout technique opens up the possibility of investigating cosmic star and element formation in the early Universe. We set a lower limit to the ejection rate of heavy elements per unit comoving volume from Type II supernovae at <z>=2.75 of ~=3.6x10^-4 M_solar yr^-1 Mpc^-3 (for q_0=0.5 and H_0=50 km s^-1 Mpc^-1), which is 3 times higher than the local value but still 4 times lower than the rate observed at z~=1. At <z>=4, our lower limit to the cosmic metal ejection rate is ~=3 times lower than the <z>=2.75 value. We discuss the implications of these results on models of galaxy formation, and on the chemical enrichment and ionization history of the intergalactic medium.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes the Fifth Data Release (DR5) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). DR5 includes all survey quality data taken through 2005 June and represents the completion of the SDSS-I project (whose successor, SDSS-II, will continue through mid-2008). It includes five-band photometric data for 217 million objects selected over 8000 deg2 and 1,048,960 spectra of galaxies, quasars, and stars selected from 5713 deg2 of that imaging data. These numbers represent a roughly 20% increment over those of the Fourth Data Release; all the data from previous data releases are included in the present release. In addition to ``standard'' SDSS observations, DR5 includes repeat scans of the southern equatorial stripe, imaging scans across M31 and the core of the Perseus Cluster of galaxies, and the first spectroscopic data from SEGUE, a survey to explore the kinematics and chemical evolution of the Galaxy. The catalog database incorporates several new features, including photometric redshifts of galaxies, tables of matched objects in overlap regions of the imaging survey, and tools that allow precise computations of survey geometry for statistical investigations.},

	Abstract = {Aims:We used chemical evolution models for galaxies of different morphological type to perform a detailed study of the evolution of the cosmic dust properties in different environments: the solar neighbourhood, elliptical galaxies and dwarf irregular galaxies. Thanks to the uptodate observations available in the solar vicinity, we intend to study the effects of dust in the chemical evolution of different types of galaxies and, at the same time, to refine investigation of the parameter space to satisfactorily fine-tune the parameters in our study. Methods: We have considered dust production from low and intermediate mass stars, supernovae Ia, supernovae II, and both dust destruction and dust accretion processes in a detailed model of chemical evolution for the solar vicinity. Then, by means of the same dust prescriptions, but adopting different galactic models (different star formation histories and the presence of galactic winds), we extended our study to ellipticals and dwarf irregular galaxies. In all these systems, dust evolution was calculated by means of chemical evolution models that relax the instantaneous recycling approximation and already reproduce the main features of the various galaxies.  Results: We have investigated how the assumption of different star formation histories affects the dust production rates, dust depletion, the dust accretion, and destruction rates. We predict dust-to-gas and dust-to-metal ratios in very good agreement with those observed in the solar vicinity. We show how the inclusion of the dust treatment is helpful in solving the so-called Fe discrepancy, as observed in the hot gaseous halos of local ellipticals, and in reproducing the chemical abundances observed in the Lyman Break Galaxies. Finally, our new models can be very useful in future detailed spectro-photometric studies of galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We present models of photometric evolution of galaxies in which the effects of a dusty interstellar medium have been included with particular care. A chemical evolution code follows the star formation rate, the gas fraction, and the metallicity, basic ingredients for the stellar population synthesis. The latter is performed with a grid of integrated spectra of simple stellar populations (SSP) of different ages and metallicities, in which the effects of dusty envelopes around asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars are included. The residual fraction of gas in the galaxy is divided into two phases: the star-forming molecular clouds and the diffuse medium. The relative amount is a model parameter. The molecular gas is subdivided into clouds of given mass and radius: it is supposed that each SSP is born within the cloud and progressively escapes it. The emitted spectrum of the star-forming molecular clouds is computed with a radiative transfer code. The diffuse dust emission (cirrus) is derived by describing the galaxy as an axially symmetric system, in which the local dust emissivity is consistently calculated as a function of the local field intensity due to the stellar component. Effects of very small grains, subject to temperature fluctuations, as well as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are included. The model is compared and calibrated with available data of normal and starburst galaxies in the local universe, in particular new broadband and spectroscopic Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) observations. It will be a powerful tool to investigate the star formation, the initial mass function (IMF), supernova rate (SNR) in nearby starbursts and normal galaxies, as well as to predict the evolution of luminosity functions of different types of galaxies at wavelengths covering four decades.},

	Abstract = {We present photometric evolution of galaxies in which, in addition to the stellar component, the effects of an evolving dusty interstellar medium have been included with particular care. Starting from the work of Calura, Pipino & Matteucci (2008), in which chemical evolution models have been used to study the evolution of both the gas and dust components of the interstellar medium in spiral, elliptical and irregular galaxies, it has been possible to combine these models with a spectrophotometric stellar synthesis code that includes dust reprocessing (GRASIL) (Silva 1998) to analyse the evolution of the Spectral Energy Distributions (SED) of these galaxies. We test our models against observed SEDs both in the local universe and at high redshift. The importance of following the dust evolution is investigated by comparing our results with those obtained by adopting simple assumptions to treat this component. Possible errors from assuming a Milky Way dust composition and a dust-to-gas ratio scaling with the metallicity particularly in young galaxies, ellipticals and low metallicity galaxies are highlighted.},

	Abstract = {In the Local Group spiral galaxy M33, we investigate the correlation between the star formation rate (SFR) surface density, Sigma_SFR, and the gas density Sigma_gas (molecular, atomic, and total). We also explore whether there are other physical quantities, such as the hydrostatic pressure and dust optical depth, which establish a good correlation with Sigma_SFR. We use the Ha, far-ultraviolet (FUV), and bolometric emission maps to infer the SFR locally at different spatial scales, and in radial bins using azimuthally averaged values. Most of the local analysis is done using the highest spatial resolution allowed by gas surveys, 180 pc. The Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) law, Sigma_SFR \propto (Sigma_gas)^n is analyzed by three statistical methods. At all spatial scales, with Ha emission as a SFR tracer, the KS indices n are always steeper than those derived with the FUV and bolometric emissions. We attribute this to the lack of Ha emission in low luminosity regions where most stars form in small clusters with an incomplete initial mass function at their high mass end. For azimuthally averaged values the depletion timescale for the molecular gas is constant, and the KS index is n_H2 = 1.1 +- 0.1. Locally, at a spatial resolution of 180 pc, the correlation between Sigma_SFR and Sigma_gas is generally poor, even though it is tighter with the molecular and total gas than with the atomic gas alone. Considering only positions where the CO J=1-0 line is above the 2-sigma detection threshold and taking into account uncertainties in Sigma_H2 and Sigma_SFR, we obtain a steeper KS index than obtained with radial averages: n_H2 = 2.22 +- 0.07 (for FUV and bolometric SFR tracers), flatter than that relative to the total gas (n_Htot = 2.59 +- 0.05).

@article{Gonzalez:2003,
	Abstract = {Recently, we have developed and calibrated the Synthetic Field Method to derive the total extinction through disk galaxies. The method is based on the number counts and colors of distant background field galaxies that can be seen through the foreground object; it is the only method capable of determining extinction without a priori assumptions about the dust properties or its spatial distribution, and it has been successfully applied to NGC 4536 and NGC 3664, two late-type galaxies located, respectively, at 16 and 11 Mpc. Here we study the applicability of the Synthetic Field Method to Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images of galaxies in the Local Group and show that background galaxies cannot be easily identified through these nearby objects, even with the best resolution available today. In the case of M31, each pixel in the HST images contains 50-100 stars, and the background galaxies cannot be seen because of the intrinsic granularity due to strong surface brightness fluctuations. In the LMC, on the other hand, there is only about one star every 6 linear pixels, and the lack of detectable background galaxies results from a ``secondary'' granularity, introduced by structure in the wings of the point-spread function (PSF). The success of the Synthetic Field Method in NGC 4536 and NGC 3664 is a natural consequence of the reduction of the intensity of surface brightness fluctuations with distance. When the dominant confusion factor is structure in the PSF wings, as is the case of HST images of the LMC and would be the case of M31 images obtained with a 10 m diffraction-limited optical telescope, it becomes possible, in principle, to improve the detectability of background galaxies by subtracting the stars in the foreground object. However, a much better characterization of optical PSFs than is currently available would be required for an adequate subtraction of the wings. Given the importance of determining the dust content of Local Group galaxies, efforts should be made in that direction.  Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.},

@article{Calzetti:1997,
	Abstract = {The reddening properties and the star formation history of a sample of 19 starburst galaxies are investigated using multiwavelength spectroscopy and infrared broad band photometry. New photometric data in the J, H, and K bands of the central starburst regions are supplemented with previously published spectra, covering the wavelength range 0.12-2.2 mu m. In the infrared, the reddening value derived for the stellar continuum is in agreement with that of the ionized gas, but the two values diverge at shorter wavelengths; in the UV, the mean optical depth of the dust in front of the stars is smaller, being only 60%, than the optical depth of the dust in front of the nebular gas. This difference can be better understood if the UV-bright stellar population and the ionized gas are not co-spatial. A model of foreground clumpy dust, with different covering factors for the gas and the stars, is proposed to account for the difference in reddening. A ``template starburst spectrum'', derived by combining the reddening-corrected UV, optical, and infrared data of all the galaxies in the sample, is used to investigate the star formation history of the galaxies. Spectral synthesis models indicate that the observed UV emission can be attributed to a stellar population which is undergoing active star formation at a constant rate since ~ 2x10(7) yr, in agreement with the supernova rates derived from the [FeII] emission line in the infrared. At least two, and probably more, intermediate age populations (age<2x10(9) yr) contribute to the optical and infrared emission, while populations older than ~ 2x10(9) yr do not contribute significantly to the template. The stellar composition of the template spectrum suggests episodic star formation over the last 10(9) yr, with star formation rates as large as or larger than the present rates. The synthetic stellar populations are generated according to an Initial Mass Function (IMF) with Salpeter slope (alpha =2.35) in the mass range 0.1-100 Msun, and reproduce a number of observational constraints, such as the spectral energy distribution of the template spectrum, the equivalent width of the atomic hydrogen emission lines, and the mass-to-light ratios; the data, then, do not provide indication for a high-mass-star truncated or a low-mass-star deficient IMF in starburst galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We present a new model for computing the spectral evolution of stellar populations at ages between 1 × 105 and 2 × 1010 yr at a resolution of 3 {\AA} across the whole wavelength range from 3200 to 9500 {\AA} for a wide range of metallicities. These predictions are based on a newly available library of observed stellar spectra. We also compute the spectral evolution across a larger wavelength range, from 91 {\AA} to 160 mum, at lower resolution. The model incorporates recent progress in stellar evolution theory and an observationally motivated prescription for thermally pulsing stars on the asymptotic giant branch. The latter is supported by observations of surface brightness fluctuations in nearby stellar populations. We show that this model reproduces well the observed optical and near-infrared colour-magnitude diagrams of Galactic star clusters of various ages and metallicities. Stochastic fluctuations in the numbers of stars in different evolutionary phases can account for the full range of observed integrated colours of star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds. The model reproduces in detail typical galaxy spectra from the Early Data Release (EDR) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We exemplify how this type of spectral fit can constrain physical parameters such as the star formation history, metallicity and dust content of galaxies. Our model is the first to enable accurate studies of absorption-line strengths in galaxies containing stars over the full range of ages. Using the highest-quality spectra of the SDSS EDR, we show that this model can reproduce simultaneously the observed strengths of those Lick indices that do not depend strongly on element abundance ratios. The interpretation of such indices with our model should be particularly useful for constraining the star formation histories and metallicities of galaxies.},

	Abstract = {The total ultraviolet (UV) flux (from 1412 to 2718 {\aa}) of M101 is compared on a pixel-to-pixel basis with the total far-infrared (FIR) flux (from 60 to 170 mum), using the maps of the galaxy taken by GALEX in the near-UV and far-UV and by ISOPHOT at 60, 100 and 170 mum. The main result of this investigation is the discovery of a tight dependence of the FIR/UV ratio on radius, with values monotonically decreasing from ~4 in the nuclear region to nearly zero towards the edge of the optical disk. Although the tightness of this depencence is in part attributable to resolution effects, the result is consistent with the presence of a large-scale distribution of diffuse dust having a face-on optical depth which decreases with radius and which dominates over the more localized variations in opacity between the arm and interarm regions. We also find a trend for the FIR/UV ratio to take on higher values in the regions of diffuse interarm emission than in the spiral-arm regions, at a given radius. This is interpreted quantitatively in terms of the escape probability of UV photons from spiral arms and their subsequent scattering in the interarm regions, and in terms of the larger relative contribution of optical photons to the heating of the dust in the interarm regions.},

	Abstract = {We present a two-dimensional (2-D) fitting algorithm (GALFIT, Version 3) with new capabilities to study the structural components of galaxies and other astronomical objects in digital images. Our technique improves on previous 2-D fitting algorithms by allowing for irregular, curved, logarithmic and power-law spirals, ring and truncated shapes in otherwise traditional parametric functions like the Sersic, Moffat, King, Ferrer, etc., profiles. One can mix and match these new shape features freely, with or without constraints, apply them to an arbitrary number of model components and of numerous profile types, so as to produce realistic-looking galaxy model images. Yet, despite the potential for extreme complexity, the meaning of the key parameters like the Sersic index, effective radius or luminosity remain intuitive and essentially unchanged. The new features have an interesting potential for use to quantify the degree of asymmetry of galaxies, to quantify low surface brightness tidal features beneath and beyond luminous galaxies, to allow more realistic decompositions of galaxy subcomponents in the presence of strong rings and spiral arms, and to enable ways to gauge the uncertainties when decomposing galaxy subcomponents. We illustrate these new features by way of several case studies that display various levels of complexity.},

	Abstract = {We report the first detection of very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray emission above 140 GeV from PKS 1424+240, a BL Lac object with an unknown redshift. The photon spectrum above 140 GeV measured by VERITAS is well described by a power law with a photon index of 3.8 +- 0.5_stat +- 0.3_syst and a flux normalization at 200 GeV of (5.1 +- 0.9_stat +- 0.5_syst) x 10^{-11} TeV^-1 cm^-2 s^-1, where stat and syst denote the statistical and systematical uncertainty, respectively. The VHE flux is steady over the observation period between MJD 54881 and 55003 (2009 February 19 to June 21). Flux variability is also not observed in contemporaneous high energy observations with the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). Contemporaneous X-ray and optical data were also obtained from the Swift XRT and MDM observatory, respectively. The broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) is well described by a one-zone synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model favoring a redshift of less than 0.1. Using the photon index measured with Fermi in combination with recent extragalactic background light (EBL) absorption models it can be concluded from the VERITAS data that the redshift of PKS 1424+240 is less than 0.66.},

	Abstract = {Aims. I present the Monte Carlo radiative transfer code TRADING (Transfer of RAdiation through Dust In Galaxies). The code self-consistently computes the extinction of radiation in a dusty medium (including absorption and scattering) and the dust emission.  Methods: A binary-tree adaptive grid is used for the description of the dust distribution. Dust radiation is computed at thermal equilibrium or under stochastic heating conditions, for a distribution of grains of different radii and materials. The code is applied to the case of a clumpy galactic disk, including both diffuse dust and a distribution of spherical clouds modelled on the GMCs of local galaxies. Diffuse and localised sources of starlight are used, with independent spectra. Results: A model is provided for the edge-on galaxy NGC 891. The SED of the galaxy from the UV to the submm/mm range can be well reproduced by a bulge/disk configuration of old stars together with an extended dust disk, as suggested by the analysis of optical/near-infrared images; a clumpy dust distribution of the same mass as the diffuse dust disk, together with a UV emitting component, half of which is in the form of a diffuse disk and half in sources embedded in clouds. In total, it is found that about 35% of the bolometric radiation is absorbed (and emitted) by dust; that absorption of starlight from the old population contributes to about 60% of the dust emission. A significant component of the dust emission from clouds is due to absorption of diffuse radiation. Radial profiles of dust emission in a clumpy disk are almost independent of the wavelength, with the exception of the wavelength range on the Wien side of the thermal equilibrium peak.},

	Abstract = {We create a model for recovering the intrinsic, absorption-corrected surface brightness distribution of a galaxy and apply the model to the M31. We construct a galactic model as a superposition of axially symmetric stellar components and a dust disc to analyse the intrinsic absorption efects. Dust column density is assumed to be proportional to the far-infrared flux of the galaxy. Along each line of sight, the observed far-infrared spectral energy distribution is approximated with modified black body functions considering dust components with different temperatures, allowing to determine the temperatures and relative column densities of the dust components. We apply the model to the nearby galaxy M31 using the Spitzer Space Telescope far-infrared observations for mapping dust distribution and temperature. A warm and a cold dust component are distinguished. The temperature of the warm dust in M31 varies between 56 and 60 K and is highest in the spiral arms; the temperature of the cold component is mostly 15-19 K and rises up to about 25 K at the centre of the galaxy. The intensity-weighted mean temperature of the dust decreases from T ~32 K at the centre to T ~20 K at R ~7 kpc and outwards. We also calculate the intrinsic UBVRIL surface brightness distributions and the spatial luminosity distribution. The intrinsic dust extinction in the V-colour rises from 0.25 mag at the centre to 0.4-0.5 mag at R = 6-13 kpc and decreases smoothly thereafter. The calculated total extinction-corrected luminosity of M31 is L_B = (3.64 pm 0.15) 10^10L_sun, corresponding to an absolute luminosity M_B = (-20.89 pm 0.04) mag. Of the total B-luminosity, 20% (0.24 mag) is obscured from us by the dust inside M31. The intrinsic shape of the bulge is slightly prolate in our best-fit model.},

	Abstract = {We introduce and publicly release a new code, ADAPTSMOOTH, which serves to smooth astronomical images in an adaptive fashion, in order to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). The adaptive smoothing scheme allows to take full advantage of the spatially resolved photometric information contained in an image in that at any location the minimal smoothing is applied to reach the requested S/N. Support is given to match more images on the same smoothing length, such that proper estimates of local colours can be done, with a big potential impact on multi-wavelength studies of extended sources (galaxies, nebulae). Different modes to estimate local S/N are provided. In addition to classical arithmetic-mean averaging mode, the code can operate in median averaging mode, resulting in a significant enhancement of the final image quality and very accurate flux conservation. To this goal also other code options are implemented and discussed in this paper. Finally, we analyze in great detail the effect of the adaptive smoothing on galaxy photometry, in particular in terms of surface brightness (SB) profiles and aperture photometry: deviations in SB with respect to the original image can be limited to <0.01 mag, with flux difference in apertures of less than 0.001 mag.},

@article{Schlegel:1998,
	Abstract = {We present a full-sky 100 mu m map that is a reprocessed composite of the COBE/DIRBE and IRAS/ISSA maps, with the zodiacal foreground and confirmed point sources removed. Before using the ISSA maps, we remove the remaining artifacts from the IRAS scan pattern. Using the DIRBE 100 and 240 mu m data, we have constructed a map of the dust temperature so that the 100 mu m map may be converted to a map proportional to dust column density. The dust temperature varies from 17 to 21 K, which is modest but does modify the estimate of the dust column by a factor of 5. The result of these manipulations is a map with DIRBE quality calibration and IRAS resolution. A wealth of filamentary detail is apparent on many different scales at all Galactic latitudes. In high-latitude regions, the dust map correlates well with maps of H I emission, but deviations are coherent in the sky and are especially conspicuous in regions of saturation of H I emission toward denser clouds and of formation of H2 in molecular clouds. In contrast, high-velocity H I clouds are deficient in dust emission, as expected. To generate the full-sky dust maps, we must first remove zodiacal light contamination, as well as a possible cosmic infrared background (CIB). This is done via a regression analysis of the 100 mu m DIRBE map against the Leiden-Dwingeloo map of H I emission, with corrections for the zodiacal light via a suitable expansion of the DIRBE 25 mu m flux. This procedure removes virtually all traces of the zodiacal foreground. For the 100 mu m map no significant CIB is detected. At longer wavelengths, where the zodiacal contamination is weaker, we detect the CIB at surprisingly high flux levels of 32 +/- 13 nW m-2 sr-1 at 140 mu m and of 17 +/- 4 nW m-2 sr-1 at 240 mu m (95% confidence). This integrated flux ~2 times that extrapolated from optical galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field. The primary use of these maps is likely to be as a new estimator of Galactic extinction. To calibrate our maps, we assume a standard reddening law and use the colors of elliptical galaxies to measure the reddening per unit flux density of 100 mu m emission. We find consistent calibration using the B-R color distribution of a sample of the 106 brightest cluster ellipticals, as well as a sample of 384 ellipticals with B-V and Mg line strength measurements. For the latter sample, we use the correlation of intrinsic B-V versus Mg2 index to tighten the power of the test greatly. We demonstrate that the new maps are twice as accurate as the older Burstein-Heiles reddening estimates in regions of low and moderate reddening. The maps are expected to be significantly more accurate in regions of high reddening. These dust maps will also be useful for estimating millimeter emission that contaminates cosmic microwave background radiation experiments and for estimating soft X-ray absorption. We describe how to access our maps readily for general use.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents an overview of the radiative transfer problem of calculating the spectral line intensity and polarization that emerges from a (generally magnetized) astrophysical plasma composed of atoms and molecules whose excitation state is significantly influenced by radiative transitions produced by an anisotropic radiation field. The numerical solution of this non-LTE problem of the 2nd kind is facilitating the physical understanding of the second solar spectrum and the exploration of the complex magnetism of the extended solar atmosphere, but much more could be learned if high-sensitivity polarimeters were developed also for the present generation of night-time telescopes. Interestingly, I find that the population ratio between the levels of some resonance line transitions can be efficiently modulated by the inclination of a weak magnetic field when the anisotropy of the incident radiation is significant, something that could provide a new diagnostic tool in astrophysics.},

	Abstract = {We study the stellar populations of a sample of 14 elliptical galaxies in the Virgo cluster. Using spectra with high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N >~ 100{\AA}-1) we propose an alternative approach to the standard side-band method to measure equivalent widths (EWs). Our boosted median continuum is shown to map the EWs more robustly than the side-band method, minimizing the effect from neighbouring absorption lines and reducing the uncertainty at a given S/N. Our newly defined line strengths are more successful at disentangling the age-metallicity degeneracy. We concentrate on Balmer lines (Hbeta, Hgamma, Hdelta), the G band and the combination [MgFe] as the main age and metallicity indicators. We go beyond the standard comparison of the observations with simple stellar populations (SSPs) and consider four different models to describe the star formation histories, either with a continuous star formation rate or with a mixture of two different SSPs. These models improve the estimates of the more physically meaningful mass-weighted ages. Composite models are found to give more consistent fits among individual line strengths and agree with an independent estimate using the spectral energy distribution. A combination of age- and metallicity-sensitive spectral features allows us to constrain the average age and metallicity. For a Virgo sample of elliptical galaxies our age and metallicity estimates correlate well with stellar mass or velocity dispersion, with a significant threshold around 5 × 1010Msolar above which galaxies are uniformly old and metal rich. This threshold is reminiscent of the one found by Kauffmann et al. in the general population of Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxies at a stellar mass 3 × 1010Msolar. In a more speculative way, our models suggest that it is formation epoch and not formation time-scale what drives the mass-age relationship of elliptical galaxies.},

	Abstract = {This paper outlines a method for reducing astrometric data to derive the closest approach time and distance to the center of an occultation shadow for a single observer. The method applies to CCD frames, strip scans, or photographic plates and uses a set of field stars of unknown positions to define a common coordinate system for all frames. The motion of the occulting body is used to establish the transformation between this common coordinate system and the celestial coordinate system of the body's ephemeris. This method is demonstrated by application to the Tr60 occultation by Triton on 1993 July 10 UT. Over an interval of 4 nights that included the occultation time, 80 frames of Triton and Tr60 were taken near the meridian with the U.S. Naval Observatory (USNO) 60-inch astrometric reflector. Application of the method presented here to these data yields a closest approach distance of 359 +- 133 km (corresponding to 0.017 +- 0.0076 arcsec) for the occultation chord obtained with the Kuiper Airborne Observatory (KAO). Comparison of the astrometric closest approach time with the KAO light-curve midtime shows a difference of 2.2 +- 4.1 sec. Relative photometry of Triton and Tr60, needed for photometric calibration of the occultation light curve, is also presented. (SECTION: The Solar System)},

	Abstract = {The ACS Nearby Galaxy Survey Treasury (ANGST) is a systematic survey to establish a legacy of uniform multi-color photometry of resolved stars for a volume-limited sample of nearby galaxies (D < 4 Mpc). The survey volume encompasses 69 galaxies in diverse environments, including close pairs, small and large groups, filaments, and truly isolated regions. The galaxies include a nearly complete range of morphological types spanning a factor of ~104 in luminosity and star formation rate. The survey data consist of images taken with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), supplemented with archival data and new Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) imaging taken after the failure of ACS. Survey images include wide field tilings covering the full radial extent of each galaxy, and single deep pointings in uncrowded regions of the most massive galaxies in the volume. The new wide field imaging in ANGST reaches median 50% completenesses of m F475W = 28.0 mag, m F606W = 27.3 mag, and m F814W = 27.3 mag, several magnitudes below the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB). The deep fields reach magnitudes sufficient to fully resolve the structure in the red clump. The resulting photometric catalogs are publicly accessible and contain over 34 million photometric measurements of >14 million stars. In this paper we present the details of the sample selection, imaging, data reduction, and the resulting photometric catalogs, along with an analysis of the photometric uncertainties (systematic and random), for both ACS and WFPC2 imaging. We also present uniformly derived relative distances measured from the apparent magnitude of the TRGB.},

	Abstract = {We present resolved stellar photometry of NGC 2976 obtained with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) as part of the ACS Nearby Galaxy Survey Treasury (ANGST) program. The data cover the radial extent of the major axis of the disk out to 6 kpc, or ~6 scale lengths. The outer disk was imaged to a depth of M_F606W ~ 1, and an inner field was imaged to the crowding limit at a depth of M_F606W ~ -1. Through detailed analysis and modeling of these CMDs we have reconstructed the star formation history of the stellar populations currently residing in these portions of the galaxy, finding similar ancient populations at all radii but significantly different young populations at increasing radii. In particular, outside of the well-measured break in the disk surface brightness profile, the age of the youngest population increases with distance from the galaxy center, suggesting that star formation is shutting down from the outside-in. We use our measured star formation history, along with H I surface density measurements, to reconstruct the surface density profile of the disk during previous epochs. Comparisons between the recovered star formation rates and reconstructed gas densities at previous epochs are consistent with star formation following the Schmidt law during the past 0.5 Gyrs, but with a drop in star formation efficiency at low gas densities, as seen in local galaxies at the present day. The current rate and gas density suggest that rapid star formation in NGC 2976 is currently in the process of ceasing from the outside-in due to gas depletion. This process of outer disk gas depletion and inner disk star formation was likely triggered by an interaction with the core of the M81 group >~1 Gyr ago that stripped the gas from the galaxy halo and/or triggered gas inflow from the outer disk toward the galaxy center.},

In this paper we present radial profiles of stellar and 8 μm emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) for 11 spiral galaxies to investigate whether the interstellar medium in these galaxies contains a central concentration above that expected from the exponential disk. In general, we find that the two-dimensional CO and PAH emission morphologies are similar, and that they exhibit similar radial profiles. We find that in 6 of the 11 galaxies there is a central excess in the 8 μm and CO emission above the inward extrapolation of an exponential disk. In particular, all four barred galaxies in the sample have strong central excesses in both 8 μm and CO emission. These correlations suggest that the excess seen in the CO profiles is, in general, not simply due to a radial increase in the CO emissivity. In the inner disk, the ratio of the stellar to the 8 μm radial surface brightness is similar for 9 of the 11 galaxies, suggesting a physical connection between the average stellar surface brightness and the average gas surface brightness at a given radius. We also find that the ratio of the CO to 8 μm PAH surface brightness is consistent over the sample, implying that the 8 μm PAH surface brightness can be used as an approximate tracer of the interstellar medium.},

	Abstract = {We present and analyse high-quality Submillimetre Common-User Bolometer Array (SCUBA) 850- and 450-μm images of 14 local spiral galaxies, including the detection of dust well out into the extended disc in many cases. We use these data in conjunction with published far-infrared flux densities from IRAS and ISO, and millimetre-wave measurements from ground-based facilities to deduce the global properties of the dust in these galaxies, in particular temperature and mass. We find that simple two-temperature greybody models of fixed dust emissivity index β= 2 and with typical temperatures of 25 < Twarm < 40 K and 10 < Tcold < 20 K provide good fits to the overall spectral energy distributions. The dust mass in the cold component correlates with the mass in atomic hydrogen and the mass in the warm component correlates with the mass in molecular hydrogen. These results thus fit the simple picture in which the cold dust is heated predominantly by the interstellar radiation field, while the hot dust is heated predominantly by OB stars in more active regions, although we argue that there is some mixing. The mean gas-to-dust mass ratio is 120 +/- 60, very similar to that found within our own galaxy and roughly a factor of 10 lower than that derived from IRAS data alone. The gas-to-dust mass ratios in the warm, molecular component are on average higher than those in the cold, atomic component. We compare our modelling results with similar results for more luminous spiral galaxies selected at far-infrared wavelengths by the SCUBA Local Universe Galaxy Survey. We find that whilst the total dust mass distributions of the two samples are indistinguishable, they have significantly different dust temperature distributions in both the warm and cold components. We suggest that this difference might be related to the level of star formation activity in these systems, with the more active galaxies having more intense interstellar radiation fields and higher dust temperatures.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes efficient algorithms that automatically take two or more catalogs of objects with instrumental coordinates and magnitudes and matches them. The challenges are that the instrumental coordinates may be only partially overlapping, at a different scale, rotated, or even inverted (flipped). The object magnitudes may be derived from different passbands so that the relative magnitudes of the objects differ. Also, the catalog may not contain all the same objects to to differences in separating close objects or to partial overlap between images. Finally, the catalog positions and magnitudes are subject to noise in the images from which they were derived. The algorithms are applicable to any automated cataloging system. However, the implementation described here is part of the Faint Object Classification and Analysis System (FOCAS). FOCAS automatically produces catalogs of objects from digital images. The algorithms described here first take a subsample of the brightest objects from the catalog, and other catalogs. Then all the objects in the catalogs are matched based on the transformed reference coordinates. (SECTION: Computing and Data Analysis)},

Most of these radial profiles are fitted well by an exponential model, and the derived 850-μm scalelengths are proportional to the HI scalelengths. From this relation, it is found that the metallicity gradients of these galaxies are much shallower than previous studies, unless the dust temperature is constant within the disc, or a significant component of molecular gas exists at large radii that is not traced by CO observations.},

@article{Bellazzini:2003,
	Abstract = {We have obtained HST-WFPC2 F555W and F814W photometry for 16 fields in the vicinity of the luminous nearby spiral galaxy M 31, sampling the stellar content of the disk and the halo at different distances from the center, from ~ 20 to ~ 150 arcmin (i.e. ~ 4.5 to 35 kpc), down to limiting V and I magnitudes of ~ 27.
The Color-Magnitude Diagrams (CMD) obtained for each field show the presence of complex stellar populations, including an intermediate age/young population and older populations with a wide range of metallicity. Those fields superposed on the disk of M 31 generally show a blue plume of stars which we identify with main sequence members. According to this interpretation, we find that the star formation rate over the last 0.5 Gyr has varied dramatically with location in the disk.

The most evident feature of all the CMDs is a prominent Red Giant Branch (RGB) with a descending tip in the V band, characteristic of metallicity higher than 1/10 Solar. A red clump is clearly detected in all of the fields, and a weak blue horizontal branch is frequently present.

The metallicity distributions, obtained by comparison of the RGB stars with globular cluster templates, all show a long, albeit scantly populated, metal-poor tail and a main component peaking at [Fe/H] ~ - 0.6. The most noteworthy characteristic of the abundance distributions is their overall similarity in all the sampled fields, covering a wide range of environments and galactocentric distances. Nevertheless, a few interesting differences and trends emerge from the general uniformity of the metallicity distributions. For example, the median [Fe/H] shows a slight decrease with distance along the minor axis (Y) up to Y =~ 20 arcmin , but the metallicity gradient completely disappears beyond this limit. Also, in some fields a very metal-rich ([Fe/H] >=-0.2) component is clearly present.

Whereas the fraction of metal-poor stars seems to be approximately constant (within few percent) in all fields, the fraction of metal-rich and, especially, very-metal-rich stars varies with position and seems to be more prominent in those fields superposed on the disk and/or with the presence of streams or substructures \cite[e.g.][]{iba01}. This might indicate and possibly trace interaction effects with some companion, e.g. M 32.

	Abstract = {We present mid-infrared (MIR) maps for a sample of 18 early-type galaxies observed at 4.5, 6.7 and 15 μ m with the ISOCAM instrument on board the ISO satellite with a 6'' spatial resolution. We model the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) of these galaxies using the stellar evolutionary synthesis model P{\'E}GASE and we derive the MIR excess over the stellar component. We then explore the nature of this excess in terms of dust and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon molecules (PAHs). We find that out of 18 galaxies, 10 show excess at 6.7 μ m (due to the presence of PAH features) and 14 show excess at 15 μ m (due to the presence of warm dust). In two galaxies, where a more complete wavelength coverage exists, an excess around 9.7 μ m is seen (presumably due to silicate dust emission), while two other galaxies are totally devoid of dust. We also examine the morphology of the galaxies in these wavelengths by plotting the azimuthally averaged radial profiles as well as the MIR color profiles. We find that for the majority of the galaxies the 4.5 μ m emission is well described by a de Vaucouleurs profile. The 6.7 μ m and 15 μ m emission is smoothly distributed throughout the galaxy while only a few galaxies show MIR emission which is more concentrated close to the center. Two dwarf galaxies in our sample show patchy distributions of the MIR emission while two other galaxies show edge-on disks. With color-color diagrams we delineate the regions occupied by late-type and early-type galaxies. Finally we show that the MIR excess found in strong radio galaxies like NGC 4486 (M87) can be explained by synchrotron emission.

It is found that the color-magnitude diagrams of the inner and outer disk regions contain similar features - blue supergiants of spectral type A, F, and G fainter than V about 18.5, as well as a population of red superginats. The mean extinction in the inner disk appears to be higher than that in the outer disk. Comparison with evolutionary tracks indicates that most of the stars detected in the inner and outer disk regions have masses less than or equal to 40 solar, suggesting that extremely massive stars are either heavily reddened or entirely absent. The outer disk luminosity functions in all three bandpasses follow power laws, with exponents similar to those observed in other galaxies. The distance modulus of NGC 253 is less than or equal to 27.0.},

	Abstract = {Broadband near-infrared images are used to probe the photometric properties of the brightest asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars within 2' of the centers of the dwarf elliptical galaxies NGC 147, NGC 185, and NGC 205. Sequences originating from oxygen-rich M giants and C stars are clearly distinguished on the (K, H-K) and (K, J-K) color-magnitude diagrams. Based on the peak brightness and color of the M giant sequences, ages of 1 and 0.1 Gyr are predicted for the most recent significant star-forming events in NGC 185 and NGC 205, respectively. The bolometric luminosity function of M giants in NGC 205 is flatter than in NGC 185, in agreement with studies at wavelengths shortward of 1 μm. The most luminous AGB stars in NGC 147 are well mixed with fainter stars throughout the area surveyed in this galaxy, and the peak brightness of the M giant sequence indicates that the most recent significant star-forming activity occurred ~3 Gyr in the past.
The C star contents of the three galaxies are compared in two ways. First, the notion of a specific frequency measurement for C stars, in which C star counts per unit magnitude are normalized to a common integrated K-band brightness using published surface photometry, is introduced. The specific frequencies of C stars outside the areas of most recent star formation agree in all three galaxies. Second, comparisons are made using the integrated brightness from C stars, which is normalized to the integrated light from M giants and the integrated light from all stars. The fractional contribution made by C stars to the total AGB light in the K-band is found to be highest in NGC 147 and lowest in the central regions of NGC 205, which is qualitatively consistent with model predictions. The fractional contribution that C stars make to the total K-band light is found to be constant both within and between galaxies, with C stars contributing 2% of the total K-band light. We conclude that, when averaged over timescales of a few gigayears, these galaxies have turned similar fractions of gas and dust, normalized according to total galaxy mass, into stars. We argue that the material for star formation likely originated in well-regulated reservoirs and demonstrate that the mass of gas needed to fuel star formation during intermediate epochs could have been supplied by winds from evolved stars. Finally, multiepoch data are used to investigate the incidence of long-period variables (LPVs) in NGC 185 and NGC 205. While tight constraints cannot be placed on the LPV content of NGC 205, roughly 70% of the stars with MK between -7.5 and -8.0 in the central regions of NGC 185 appear to be LPVs with amplitudes similar to those of LPVs in the LMC.

	Abstract = {We have obtained Johnson V and Gunni photometry for a large number of Local Group galaxies using the Isaac Newton Telescope Wide Field Camera (INT WFC). The majority of these galaxies are members of the M31 subgroup and the observations are deep enough to study the top few magnitudes of the red giant branch in each system. We previously measured the location of the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) for Andromeda I, Andromeda II and M33 to within systematic uncertainties of typically <0.05 mag. As the TRGB acts as a standard candle in old, metal-poor stellar populations, we were able to derive distances to each of these galaxies. Here we derive TRGB distances to the giant spiral galaxy M31 and 13 additional dwarf galaxies - NGC 205, 185, 147, Pegasus, WLM, LGS3, Cetus, Aquarius, And III, V, VI, VII and the newly discovered dwarf spheroidal And IX. The observations for each of the dwarf galaxies were intentionally taken in photometric conditions. In addition to the distances, we also self-consistently derive the median metallicity of each system from the colour of their red giant branches. This allows us to take into account the small metallicity variation of the absolute I magnitude of the TRGB. The homogeneous nature of our data and the identical analysis applied to each of the 17 Local Group galaxies ensures that these estimates form a reliable set of distance and metallicity determinations that are ideal for comparative studies of Local Group galaxy properties.},

@article{Holwerda:2007a,
	Abstract = {The quantity of dust in a spiral disk can be estimated using the dust's typical emission or the extinction of a known source. In this paper we compare two techniques, one based on emission and one on absorption, applied to sections of 14 disk galaxies. The two measurements reflect, respectively, the average and apparent optical depth of a disk section. Hence, they depend differently on the average number and optical depth of ISM structures in the disk. The small-scale geometry of the cold ISM is critical for accurate models of the overall energy budget of spiral disks. ISM geometry, relative contributions of different stellar populations, and dust emissivity are all free parameters in galaxy spectral energy distribution (SED) models; they are also sometimes degenerate, depending on wavelength coverage. Our aim is to constrain the typical ISM geometry. The apparent optical depth measurement comes from the number of distant galaxies seen in Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images through the foreground disk, calibrated with the synthetic field method (SFM). We discuss what can be learned from the SFM measurement alone regarding ISM geometry. We measure the IR flux in images from the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxy Survey in the same section of the disk that was covered by HST. A physical model of the dust is fit to the SED to estimate the dust surface density, mean temperature, and brightness in these disk sections. The surface density is subsequently converted into the average optical depth estimate. The two measurements generally agree, and the SED model finds mostly cold dust (T < 25 K). The ratios between the measured average and apparent optical depths of the disk sections imply optically thin (τc = 0.4) clouds in these disks. Optically thick disks are likely to have more than a single cloud along the line of sight.},

	Abstract = {The "Synthetic Field Method" (SFM) was introduced by Gonz{\'a}lez et al. (1998, ApJ, 506, 152) to calibrate numbers of distant galaxies as a probe of extinction in a foreground spiral disk. Gonz{\'a}lez et al. (2003, AJ, 125, 1182) studied the effect of the foreground disk on these numbers using simulations of current and future instruments for fields in the LMC, M 31 and NGC 4536, a galaxy in Virgo. They concluded that: (1) the brighter centers of disks were unsuitable; (2) the granularity of the disk at a fixed surface brightness is the limiting factor in the detection of distant galaxies; and (3) the optimum distance for measurements would be that of the Virgo cluster for the current instruments on board HST. At this distance the foreground disk is smoothed with distance, improving detection of distant background galaxies. Holwerda et al. (2005a, AJ, 129, 1381) automated the SFM and Holwerda et al. (2005b, AJ, 129, 1396) applied it to a large set of WFPC2 fields. In this paper, the quality of the extinction measurement in these fields is compared to their distance, granularity, surface brightness and structure. The average surface brightness of the of a field is shown to directly influence the accuracy of the SFM. This restricts meaningful measurements to the disks of spiral galaxies. Large structures such as spiral arms have a similar effect. The granularity or small scale structure in a field influences the detection of distant galaxies, limiting the SFM measurements in nearby disks. From the trends in the accuracy and maximum practical field-of-view considerations, the minimum and maximum distance for SFM application, approximately 5 and 35 Mpc respectively. Using the same instrument and detection method, the relations with SFM parameters and field characteristics can be used to forgo the synthetic fields altogether. For the wealth of ACS fields becoming available in the archive, these relations can be used to select those fields based on expected SFM accuracy.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we explore the relation between dust extinction and stellar light distribution in disks of spiral galaxies. Extinction influences our dynamical and photometric perception of disks, since it can distort our measurement of the contribution of the stellar component. To characterize the total extinction by a foreground disk, Gonz{\'a}lez et al. (1998, ApJ, 506, 152) proposed the "Synthetic Field Method" (SFM), which uses the calibrated number of distant galaxies seen through the foreground disk as a direct indication of extinction. The method is described in Gonz{\'a}lez et al. (1998, ApJ, 506, 152) and Holwerda et al. (2005a, AJ, 129, 1381). To obtain good statistics, the method was applied to a set of HST/WFPC2 fields (Holwerda et al. 2005b, AJ, 129, 1396) and radial extinction profiles were derived, based on these counts. In the present paper, we explore the relation of opacity with surface brightness or color from 2MASS images, as well as the relation between the scalelengths for extinction and light in the I band. We find that there is indeed a relation between the opacity (AI) and the surface brightness, particularly at the higher surface brightnesses. No strong relation between near infrared (H-J, H-K) color and opacity is found. The scalelengths of the extinction are uncertain for individual galaxies but seem to indicate that the dust distribution is much more extended than the stellar light. The results from the distant galaxy counts are also compared to the reddening derived from the Cepheids light-curves (Freedman et al. 2001, ApJ, 553, 47). The extinction values are consistent, provided the selection effect against Cepheids with higher values of AI is taken into account. The implications from these relations for disk photometry, M/L conversion and galaxy dynamical modeling are briefly discussed.},

	Abstract = {The opacity of spiral galaxy disks, from counts of distant galaxies, is compared to HI column densities. The opacity measurements are calibrated using the "Synthetic Field Method" from Gonz{\'a}lez et al. (1998, ApJ, 506, 152), Holwerda et al. (2005a, AJ, 129, 1381). When compared for individual disks, the HI column density and dust opacity do not seem to be correlated as HI and opacity follow different radial profiles. To improve statistics, an average radial opacity profile is compared to an average HI profile. Compared to dust-to-HI estimates from the literature, more extinction is found in this profile. This difference may be accounted for by an underestimate of the dust in earlier measurements due to their dependence on dust temperature. Since the SFM is insensitive to the dust temperature, the ratio between the SFM opacity and HI could very well be indicative of the true ratio. Earlier claims for a radially extended cold dust disk were based on sub-mm observations. A comparison between sub-mm observations and counts of distant galaxies is therefore desirable. We present the best current example of such a comparison, M 51, for which the measurements seem to agree. However, this remains an area where improved counts of distant galaxies, sub-mm observations and our understanding of dust emissivity are needed.},

	Abstract = {Dust extinction can be determined from the number of distant field galaxies seen through a spiral disk. To calibrate this number for the crowding and confusion introduced by the foreground image, Gonz{\'a}lez et al. and Holwerda et al. developed the Synthetic Field Method (SFM), which analyzes synthetic fields constructed by adding various deep exposures of unobstructed background fields to the candidate foreground galaxy field. The advantage of the SFM is that it gives the average opacity for the area of a galaxy disk without making assumptions about either the distribution of absorbers or of the disk starlight. However, it is limited by poor statistics on the surviving field galaxies, hence the need to combine a larger sample of fields. This paper presents the first results for a sample of 32 deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/WFPC2 archival fields of 29 spiral galaxies. The radial profiles of average dust extinction in spiral galaxies based on calibrated counts of distant field galaxies is presented here, both for individual galaxies and for composites from our sample. The effects of inclination, spiral arms, and Hubble type on the radial extinction profile are discussed. The dust opacity of the disk apparently arises from two distinct components: an optically thicker (AI=0.5-4 mag) but radially dependent component associated with the spiral arms and a relatively constant optically thinner disk (AI~0.5 mag). These results are in complete agreement with earlier work on occulted galaxies. The early-type spiral disks in our sample show less extinction than the later types. Low surface brightness galaxies, and possibly Sd's, appear effectively transparent. The average color of the field galaxies seen through foreground disks does not appear to change with radius or opacity. This gray behavior is most likely due to the patchy nature of opaque clouds. The average extinction of a radial annulus and its average surface brightness seem to correlate for the brighter regions. This leads to the conclusion that the brighter parts of the spiral disk, such as spiral arms, are also the ones with the most extinction associated with them.},

	Abstract = {Dust extinction in spiral disks can be estimated from the counts of background field galaxies, provided the deleterious effects of confusion introduced by structure in the image of the foreground spiral disk can be calibrated. Gonz{\'a}lez et al. developed a method for this calibration, the Synthetic Field Method (SFM), and applied this concept to a Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 image of NGC 4536. The SFM estimates the total extinction through the disk without requiring assumptions about the distribution of absorbers or disk light. The poor statistics, however, result in large errors in individual measurements. We report on improvements to and automation of the SFM that render it suitable for application to large archival data sets. To illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of this new method, the results on NGC 1365, an SBb galaxy, and NGC 4536, an SABbc, are presented. The extinction estimate for NGC 1365 is AI=0.6+0.6-0.7 at 0.45R25, and for NGC 4536 it is AI=1.6+1.0-1.3 at 0.75R25. The results for NGC 4536 are compared with those of Gonz{\'a}lez et al. The automation is found to limit the maximum depth to which field galaxies can be found. Taking this into account, our results agree with those of Gonz{\'a}lez et al. We conclude that this method can only give an inaccurate measure of extinction for a field covering a small solid angle. An improved measurement of disk extinction can be done by averaging the results over a series of HST fields, thereby improving the statistics. This can be achieved with the automated method, trading some completeness limit for speed. The results from this set of fields are reported in a companion paper by Holwerda et al.},

@article{Gonzalez:1998,
	Abstract = {We describe a new direct method for determining the opacity of foreground galaxies that does not require any a priori assumptions about the spatial distribution or the reddening law of the obscuring material. The method is to measure the colors and counts of background galaxies that can be identified through the foreground system. The method is calibrated and the effects of confusion and obscuration are decoupled by adding various versions of a suitable deep-reference frame containing only field galaxies with known properties into the image of the foreground galaxy and analyzing these ``synthetic field'' images in the same way as the real images. We test the method on Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 archived images of two galaxies that are quite different: NGC 4536 is a large Sc spiral, and NGC 3664 is a small Magellanic irregular. The reference frames are taken from the Hubble Deep Field. From the background galaxy counts, NGC 4536 shows an extinction of A_I ~ 1 mag in the northwestern arm region and A_I < 0.5 mag in the corresponding interarm region (no correction for inclination has been attempted). However, from the galaxy colors, the same reddening of E(V-I) ~ 0.2 is observed in both the arm and the interarm regions. In the interarm region, the combination of extinction and reddening can be explained by a diffuse component with a Galactic reddening law (R_V ~ 3). In the spiral arm, however, the same diffuse, low-opacity component seems to coexist with regions of much higher opacity. Since the exposures are shorter, the results for NGC 3664 are less clear but also appear to be consistent with a two-component distribution.},

Using diameter-limited and magnitude-limited subsamples, it can discriminate between the opaque and transparent cases with the axis-ratio distribution test. Results support the traditional view that Sc galaxies are semitransparent, but the brightness difference between face-on and edge-on can be as large as 1.0 to 1.5 mag. Analyzing surface-brightness profiles at various radii, it is seen that the central regions are essentially opaque, and the outer regions nearly fully transparent. It is shown that conclusions differ from those of Valentijn, because of neglect to take secondary inclination effects into account.},

	Abstract = {The opacity of spiral galaxies is examined by modelling the dust and stellar content of individual galaxies. The three dimensional model that we use assumes exponential distributions for the dust and the stars in the disk, while the R(1/4) law is used to describe the bulge. In this model, both absorption and scattering by the dust are taken into account. The model is applied to five late-type spiral galaxies (NGC 4013, IC 2531, UGC 1082, NGC 5529 and NGC 5907) using their optical (and near infrared for IC 2531) surface photometry. For these galaxies we have determined the scalelengths and scaleheights of the stars and the dust in the disk, the bulge characteristics, the inclination angle and the face-on optical depth. Computation of the dust masses, as well as the extinction as a function of the wavelength, are also reported. Having analyzed a total of seven galaxies thus far, the five galaxies mentioned above plus UGC 2048 and NGC 891 presented in (Xilouris et al. 1997, 1998), we are able to draw some general conclusions, the most significant of which are: 1) The face-on central optical depth is less than one in all optical bands, indicating that typical spiral galaxies like the ones that we have modelled would be completely transparent if they were to be seen face-on. 2) The dust scaleheight is about half that of the stars, which means that the dust is more concentrated near the plane of the disk. 3) The dust scalelength is about 1.4 times larger than that of the stars and the dust is more radially extended than the stars. 4) The dust mass is found to be about an order of a magnitude more than previously measured using the IRAS fluxes, indicating the existence of a cold dust component. The gas-to-dust mass ratio calculated is close to the value derived for our Galaxy. 5) The derived extinction law matches quite well the Galactic extinction law, indicating a universal dust behaviour.},

We find that the re-radiation of the dust, estimated from the far-infrared emission, is on average only 31+/-1 percent of the bolometric luminosity of a spiral galaxy, indicating that less than one third of the stellar radiation is absorbed and then re-radiated by dust in a spiral disk. Applying a radiation transfer model which assumes a "Sandwich" configuration for the spiral disk, and fully takes into account the effect of scattering, we find for our sample a median of the face-on blue (4400A) optical depth τ_B_=0.49 and the mean <τ_B_>=0.60+/-0.04, indicating that most spiral galaxies in our sample are not opaque for blue light (τ_B_<1).},

	Abstract = {A sample of more than 1700 galaxies for which I band CCD images, redshifts, and H I lines velocity widths are available is used to study the dependence on luminosity of the main photometric parameters of spiral disks. For some derivations, the sample is complemented by other data in the public domain. The impact of sample selection criteria on the distribution function of observed parameters is monitored vis-a-vis sample visibility functions and by inspecting the properties of Monte Carlo simulations of the data. Significant dependences on luminosity are found for the disk central surface brightness and for the relations that convert isophotal radii, scale lengths, and magnitudes to the edge-on perspective. These dependences are tightly wedded to the extinction processes that operate in disks. The amount of internal extinction at I band depends both on disk inclination and galaxy luminosity: more luminous edge-on galaxies appear to be dimmed more than less luminous ones. Corrections of the isophotal radius at μ_I_ = 23.5 mag arcsec^- 2^ to the face-on perspective are larger for intrinsically faint galaxies. At that isophote, the less luminous galaxies appear to be completely transparent while the photometric profiles of highly inclined, luminous objects may still be affected by extinction. The relative amount of internal extinction suggests that the ratio of scale heights for the stellar and dust components of the disk decreases with increasing luminosity. Adoption of inadequate extinction laws that do not take into account the luminosity dependence can affect the slope of the Tully- Fisher relation and may introduce nonlinearity, resulting in both a luminosity bias and an inclination bias in the predicted galaxy distances.},

@article{Masters:2003,
	Abstract = {In order to study the effects of internal extinction in spiral galaxies, we search for correlations of near-infrared (NIR) photometric parameters with inclination. We use data from the Two Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS) Extended Source Catalog (XSC) on 15,224 spiral galaxies for which we also have redshifts. For 3035 of the galaxies, I-band photometry is available, which is included in the analysis. From the simple dependence of reddening on inclination we derive a lower limit to the difference in magnitude between the face-on and edge-on aspect of 0.9, 0.3, and 0.1 mag in I (0.81 μm), J (1.25 μm), and H (1.65 μm) bands. We find that the faintest isophotal radius reported in the XSC (at the 21st mag arcsec-2 level) is closer to the centers of the galaxies than other common isophotal measures (e.g., the 23.5 mag arcsec-2 radius in I band) and argue that it should not be assumed to represent an outer isophote at which galaxies are transparent at all viewing angles. A simple linear extinction law [i.e., ΔM=γlog(a/b)] is not adequate for the full range of disk inclinations, and we adopt both a bilinear and a quadratic law. A simple photometric model is used to explain the observed behavior. Internal extinction depends on galaxy luminosity. We show that for galaxies with a Ks total magnitude dimmer than -20, -20.7, and -20.9 the data indicate zero extinction in J, H, and Ks, respectively, while disk opacity increases monotonically with increasing disk luminosity.},

	Abstract = {We present optical and IR surface photometry of M51 (NGC 5194) at B, V, R, I, J, K, and CO(2.3 μm). These data are used to establish whether K band (2.2 μm) images of spiral galaxies provide reliable maps of stellar surface mass density features such as massive spiral arms or bars. The main distorting agents in the mapping at shorter wavelengths are dust extinction and luminous young stars. From modeling the color changes across the main dust lanes in M51, we find the optical depths to be ˜0.5 in the K band. For these optical depths the K band flux is attenuated by only ≲10% even in the dust lanes. From monitoring the gravity-sensitive CO(2.3 μm) index across the spiral arms we find that young, red supergiants do not distort significantly the K band image except in one small patch. OB associations are visible in the K band images but only cover a very small fraction of the spiral arms. On this basis, we conclude that K band images of face-on galaxies do trace the massive disk star population and allow a mapping of the azimuthal variation in the surface mass density of the stellar disk. In M51 we find the surface mass density contrast (arm/interarm) to range from 1.8 to 3, comparable to results from N-body simulations of the galaxy's tidal encounter with NGC 5195. This density contrast is larger than the light contrast in I band images, where the spiral arm crest is affected by dust extinction. The spiral arm amplitudes in M51 clearly show smooth, strong radial variations, with a maximum at ˜130" and minima at 45" and 170". These variations may arise from interference of a pre-existing spiral pattern with the tidally induced spiral arms. An ongoing K band imaging study of a sample of spiral galaxies will yield a more representative picture of the role of bars and massive spiral arm features.},

	Abstract = {Interstellar dust in the Magellanic Clouds, with a weak or nearly absent 2175 A extinction feature, may be of interest in studies of galaxies in early stages of chemical evolution. To this inquiry, we extend the graphite-silicate grain model, introduced by Mathis, Rumpl, and Nordsieck and developed by Draine and Lee (1984) from the Milky Way to the Magellanic Clouds. We find that the empirical extinction curves in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds can be reproduced by adjusting only the relative abundances of graphite and silicate grains, while leaving all other model properties fixed to those appropriate for the Galactic extinction curve. Using the graphite-silicate models, we calculate the absorption and scattering optical depths, the mass-density ratio of interstellar dust to neutral hydrogen, and the Kramers-Kronig relation for all three galaxies. We also present a fitting function for the three extinction curves, valid not only over the observed range of wavelengths but also over the full range as predicted by the models. All the quantities we derived here are independent of the dust-to-gas ratios in the Milky Way and the Magellanic Clouds, and can be applied to other galaxies if they contain Galactic or Magellanic-type dust.},

The fraction of binary systems is estimated from the color distribution of objects near the main sequence (MS) with a method analogous to that introduced by Rubenstein & Bailyn. We have unequivocally detected a significant population of binary systems with a radial distribution that has been significantly influenced by mass segregation. In the inner region of the cluster (r<1rh~=1.6rc) the binary fraction (fb) lies in the range 0.08-0.38 regardless of the assumed distribution of mass ratios, F(q). The most probable fb lies between 0.10 and 0.20 depending on the adopted F(q). On the other hand, in the outer region (r>=1rh), fb must be less than 0.10, and the most likely value is 0.0, independently of the adopted F(q). The detected population of binaries is dominated by primordial systems. The specific frequency of blue stragglers (BSs) is exceptionally high, suggesting that the BS production mechanism via binary evolution can be very efficient. A large population of BSs is possible even in low-density environments if a sufficient reservoir of primordial binaries is available. The observed distribution of BSs in the color-magnitude diagram is not compatible with a rate of BS production that has been constant in time, if it is assumed that all the BSs are formed by the merging of two stars.

For exactly edge-on galaxies, the distribution of optical rotation velocity along the midplane of the disk reflects the degree of opacity. For inclined galaxies, dust obscuration can be measured from the asymmetric luminosity distribution in the direction parallel to the minor axis. We applied these two opacity tests to a sample of galaxies. The results suggest that spiral disks are not optically thick as claimed by other recent studies.},

	Abstract = {A 2.4-micron map of the northern Galactic plan is used to determine the 3D luminosity distribution of the Milky Way. The radial surface brightness profile of the disk is found to have an exponential scale length of 3.0 kpc. In the solar neighborhood, the scale height is about 247 pc, which is in agreement with star counts perpendicular to the Galactic plane. The scale height is not constant with the radius but decreases to about 165 pc. To the first order, the bulge can be represented by an oblate spheroid with an axis ratio of 0.61. The 2.2-micron/12-micron flux ratio for the bulge is typical of other dust-free spheroidal systems. Luminosity fluctuations along the Galactic plane are found to be caused chiefly by variations in the line-of-sight extinction.},

	Abstract = {I present preliminary BV resolved stellar photometry of the M31 disc measured from the data set of the NOAO/CTIO Local Group Survey. I have performed detailed analyses of the star-formation histories in and around three currently active regions in the M31 disc: OB 78, OB 102 and the north-east spiral arm. The results suggest that low Hα emission from OB 78 compared with other active regions is directly related to the details of the recent star formation histories of the regions. In addition, while every active region I analysed shows a recent increase in star formation activity, some active regions also contain overdensities of stars with ages <~100 Myr compared with adjacent regions. The adjacent regions show a relatively constant, low star formation rate over the past 100 Myr. There is no significant difference between the stellar populations on either side of the active regions. This symmetry provides no obvious signature of recent propagation of star formation near these currently active regions of the M31 disc.},

@article{Kong:2004,
	Abstract = {We compile a new sample of 115 nearby, non-Seyfert galaxies spanning a wide range of star formation activities, from starburst to nearly dormant, based on ultraviolet observations with various satellites. We combine these observations with infrared observations to study the relation between ratio of total far-infrared to ultraviolet luminosity and ultraviolet spectral slope (the IRX-UV relation). We show that, at fixed ultraviolet spectral slope, quiescent star-forming galaxies in our sample have systematically lower ratio of total far-infrared to ultraviolet luminosity than starburst galaxies. The strengths of spectral indices sensitive to star formation history, such as the 4000-{\AA} spectral discontinuity and the Hα emission equivalent width, correlate well with distance from the mean relation for starburst galaxies in the IRX-UV diagram, while there is little or no correlation between the dust-sensitive Hα/Hβ ratio and this distance. This is strong observational evidence that the star formation history is relevant to the second parameter affecting the IRX-UV relation. We show that these results can be understood in the framework of the simple model of Charlot & Fall for the transfer of starlight through the interstellar medium in galaxies. We confirm that, for starburst galaxies, the tight IRX-UV relation can be understood most simply as a sequence in overall dust content. In addition, we find that the broadening of the relation for quiescent star-forming galaxies can be understood most simply as a sequence in the ratio of present to past-averaged star formation rate. We use a library of Monte Carlo realizations of galaxies with different star formation histories and dust contents to quantify the accuracy to which the ultraviolet attenuation AFUV of a galaxy can be estimated from either the ratio of far-infrared to ultraviolet luminosity or the ultraviolet spectral slope. We provide simple formulae for estimating AFUV as a function of either of these observational quantities and show that the accuracy of these estimates can be significantly improved if some constraints are available on the ratio of present to past-averaged star formation rate.},

@article{Buat:1996,
	Abstract = {We have used a radiation transfer model to estimate the extinction in galactic disks considering their ultraviolet, optical and infrared emission and applied this model to a sample of 152 disk galaxies observed both in ultraviolet (UV) (2000A) and far-infrared (FIR) by IRAS. The sample galaxies are found to exhibit a moderate extinction at 2000A: 0.9 and 0.2 magnitude in average for Sa-Scd and Sd-Irr galaxies respectively. Most of the dust heating is due to the UV non-ionizing radiation (912-3650A). The optical depth estimated with our model does not correlate with the atomic hydrogen surface density whereas a positive correlation is found with the molecular and total (HI plus H_2_) surface densities. The presence of a strong selection bias in our sample toward galaxies with a low extinction is dismissed by a comparison between the UV and FIR detections in two selected fields. A calibration of the FIR (40-120μm) luminosity in quantitative star formation rate is performed by a comparison with the intrinsic UV luminosity (i.e. corrected from extinction) at 2000A for Sb-Irr galaxies. Although the mean relation found between the FIR luminosity and the recent star formation rate is in agreement with previous determinations, the dispersion of this calibration amounts a factor ~2 (1σ). The cause for this dispersion is found different when considering the galaxies with low and high UV optical depth: the variation of the optical depth explains most of the dispersion in galaxies optically thin at UV wavelengths whereas the relative contribution to the dust heating by the UV photons compared to that by the optical photons becomes an important factor at large UV optical depths.},

	Abstract = {IR emission spectra are calculated for dust heated by starlight, for mixtures of amorphous silicate and graphitic grains, including varying amounts of PAH particles. The models are constrained to reproduce the average Milky Way extinction curve. The calculations include the effects of single-photon heating. Updated IR absorption properties for the PAHs are presented that are consistent with observed emission spectra, including those newly obtained by Spitzer. We find a size distribution for the PAHs giving emission band ratios consistent with the observed spectra of the Milky Way and other galaxies. Emission spectra are presented for a wide range of starlight intensities. We calculate how the efficiency of emission into different IR bands depends on PAH size; the strong 7.7 μm emission feature is produced mainly by PAH particles containing <103 C atoms. We also calculate how the emission spectrum depends on U, the starlight intensity relative to the local interstellar radiation field. The submillimeter and far-infrared emission is compared to the observed emission from the local interstellar medium. Using a simple distribution function, we calculate the emission spectrum for dust heated by a distribution of starlight intensities, such as occurs within galaxies. The models are parameterized by the PAH mass fraction qPAH, the lower cutoff Umin of the starlight intensity distribution, and the fraction γ of the dust heated by starlight with U>Umin. We present graphical procedures using Spitzer IRAC and MIPS photometry to estimate the parameters qPAH, Umin, and γ, the fraction fPDR of the dust luminosity coming from photodissociation regions with U>100, and the total dust mass Mdust.},

	Abstract = {Physical dust models are presented for 65 galaxies in SINGS that are strongly detected in the four IRAC bands and three MIPS bands. For each galaxy we estimate (1) the total dust mass, (2) the fraction of the dust mass contributed by PAHs, and (3) the intensity of the starlight heating the dust grains. We find that spiral galaxies have dust properties resembling the dust in the local region of the Milky Way, with similar dust-to-gas ratio and similar PAH abundance. The observed SEDs, including galaxies with SCUBA photometry, can be reproduced by dust models that do not require ``cold'' (T<~10 K) dust. The dust-to-gas ratio is observed to be dependent on metallicity. In the interstellar media of galaxies with AO≡12+log10(O/H)>8.1, grains contain a substantial fraction of interstellar Mg, Si, and Fe. Galaxies with AO<8.1 and extended H I envelopes in some cases appear to have global dust-to-gas ratios that are low for their measured oxygen abundance, but the dust-to-gas ratio in the regions where infrared emission is detected generally appears to be consistent with a substantial fraction of interstellar Mg, Si, and Fe being contained in dust. The PAH index qPAH, the fraction of the dust mass in the form of PAHs, correlates with metallicity. The nine galaxies in our sample with AO<8.1 have a median qPAH=1.0%, whereas galaxies with AO>8.1 have a median qPAH=3.55%. The derived dust masses favor a value XCO~4×1020 cm-2 (K km s-1)-1 for the CO-to-H2 conversion factor. Except for some starbursting systems (Mrk 33, Tol 89, NGC 3049), dust in the diffuse ISM dominates the IR power.},

@article{Pahre:1998,
	Abstract = {The physical origins of the fundamental plane (FP) scaling relations are investigated using large samples of early-type galaxies observed at optical and near-infrared wavelengths. The slope a in the FP relation r_eff ~ sigma^a_0<Sigma>^b_eff is shown to increase systematically with wavelength from the U band (lambda ~ 0.35 μm) through the K band (lambda ~ 2.2 μm). A distance-independent construction of the observables is described that provides an accurate measurement of the change in the FP slope between any pair of bandpasses. The variation of the FP slope with wavelength is strong evidence of systematic variations in stellar content along the elliptical galaxy sequence, but is insufficient to discriminate between a number of simple models for possible physical origins of the FP. The intercept of the diagnostic relationship between log D_K/D_V and log sigma_0 shows no significant dependence on environment within the uncertainties of the Galactic extinction corrections, demonstrating the universality of the stellar population contributions at the level of Delta(V - K) = 0.03 mag to the zero point of the global scaling relations. Several other constraints on the properties of early-type galaxies-the slope of the Mg_2-sigma_0 relation, the slope of the FP in the K band, the effects of stellar population gradients, and the effects of deviations of early-type galaxies from a dynamically homologous family-are included to construct an empirical, self-consistent model that provides a complete picture of the underlying physical properties that are varying along the early-type galaxy sequence. The fundamental limitations to providing accurate constraints on the individual model parameters (variations in age and metallicity, and the size of the homology breaking) appear to be subtle variations between stellar population synthesis models and poorly constrained velocity dispersion aperture effects. This empirical approach nonetheless demonstrates that there are significant systematic variations in both age and metallicity along the elliptical galaxy sequence, and that a small, but systematic, breaking of dynamical homology (or a similar, wavelength-independent effect) is required. The intrinsic thickness of the FP can then be easily understood as small variations in age and metallicity, as well as deviations from a homology at any particular point along the FP. The model parameters will be better constrained by measurements of the change of the slope of the FP with redshift; predictions for this evolution with redshift are described. This model for the underlying physical properties that produce the FP scaling relations provides a comprehensive framework for future investigations of the global properties of early-type galaxies and their evolution.},

@article{Jorgensen:1996,
	Abstract = {We have analysed the shape of the Fundamental Plane (FP) for a sample of 226 E and S0 galaxies in 10 clusters of galaxies. We find that the distribution of galaxies is well approximated by a plane of the form log r_e=1.24 log sigma-0.82 log <I>_e+gammafor photometry obtained in Gunn r. This result is in good agreement with previous determinations. The FP has a scatter of 0.084 in log r_e. For galaxies with velocity dispersion larger than 100 km s^-1 the scatter is 0.073. If the FP is used for distance determinations this scatter is equivalent to 17 per cent uncertainties on distances to single galaxies. We find that the slope of the FP is not significantly different from cluster to cluster. Selection effects and measurement errors can introduce biases in the derived slope. The residuals of the FP correlate weakly with the velocity dispersion and the surface brightness. Some of the coefficients used in the literature give rather strong correlations between the residuals and absolute magnitudes. This implies that galaxies need to be selected in a homogeneous way to avoid biases of derived distances on the level of 5-10 per cent or smaller. The FP has significant intrinsic scatter. No other structural parameters like ellipticity or isophotal shape can reduce the scatter significantly. This is in contradiction to simple models, which predict that the presence of discs in E and S0 galaxies can introduce scatter in the FP. It remains unknown what the source of scatter is. It is therefore unknown whether this source produces systematic errors in distance determinations. The Mg_2-sigma relation for the cluster galaxies differs slightly from cluster to cluster. Galaxies in clusters with lower velocity dispersions have systematically lower Mg_2. The effect can be caused by both age and metallicity variations. With the current stellar population models, the best agreement with our results regarding the FP is if the offsets are mainly caused by differences in metallicity. Most of the distances that we derive from the FP imply small peculiar motions (<1000 km s^-1). The zero point of the FP must therefore be quite stable. Only for one cluster, located 28 deg from the direction towards the `Great Attractor', do we find a peculiar motion of 1300 km s^-1. This motion is reduced to 890 km s^-1 if we use the FP corrected for the offset of the Mg_2-sigma relation. This confirms earlier suggestions that the residuals from the Mg_2-sigma relation can be used to flag galaxies with deviant populations, and possibly to correct the distance determinations for the deviations.},

This relation holds over five decades in mass. Galaxy color, stellar fraction, and Υ* are correlated with each other and with Md, in the sense that more massive galaxies tend to be more evolved. There is a systematic dependence of the degree of maximality of disks on surface brightness. High surface brightness galaxies typically have Υ*~3/4 of the maximum disk value, while low surface brightness galaxies typically attain ~1/4 of this amount.},

	Abstract = {Results are reported from an analysis of the structural properties of dynamically hot galaxies which combines central velocity dispersion, effective surface brightness, and effective radius into a new 3-space (k), in which the axes are parameters that are physically meaningful. Hot galaxies are found to divide into groups in k-space that closely parallel conventional morphological classifications, namely, luminous ellipticals, compacts, bulges, bright dwarfs, and dwarf spheroidals. A major sequence is defined by luminous ellipticals, bulges, and most compacts, which together constitute a smooth continuum in k-space. Several properties vary smoothly with mass along this continuum, including bulge-to-disk ratio, radio properties, rotation, degree of velocity anisotropy, and 'unrelaxed'. A second major sequence is comprised of dwarf ellipticals and dwarf spheroidals. It is suggested that mass loss is a major factor in hot dwarf galaxies, but the dwarf sequence cannot be simply a mass-loss sequence, as it has the wrong direction in k-space.},

	Abstract = {We analyze the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) UV and the optical spectra of 39 starburst and blue compact galaxies in order to study the average properties of dust extinction in extended regions of galaxies. The optical spectra have been obtained using an aperture which matches that of IUE, so comparable regions within each galaxy are sampled. The data from the 39 galaxies are compared with five models for the geometrical distribution of dust, adopting as extinction laws both the Milky Way and the Large Magellanic Cloud laws. The commonly used uniform dust screen is included among the models. We find that none of the five models is in satisfactory agreement with the data. In order to understand the discrepancy between the data and the models, we have derived an extinction law directly from the data in the UV and optical wavelength range. The resulting curve is characterized by an overall slope which is more gray than the Milky Way extinction law's slope, and by the absence of the 2175 A dust feature. Remarkably, the difference in optical depth between the Balmer emission lines Halpha and Hbeta is about a factor of 2 larger than the difference in the optical depth between the continuum underlying the two Balmer lines. We interpret this discrepancy as a consequence of the fact that the hot ionizing stars are associated with dustier regions than the cold stellar population is. The absence of the 2175 A dust feature can be due either to the effects of the scattering and clumpiness of the dust or to a chemical composition different from that of the Milky Way dust grains. Disentangling the two interpretations is not easy because of the complexity of the spatial distribution of the emitting regions. The extinction law of the UV and optical spectral continua of extended regions can be applied to the spectra of medium- and high-redshift galaxies, where extended regions of a galaxy are, by necessity, sampled.},

	Abstract = {We present an analysis of an occulting galaxy pair, serendipitously discovered in the ACS Nearby Galaxy Survey Treasury observations of NGC 253 taken with the Hubble Space Telescope's (HST) Advanced Camera for Surveys in F475W, F606W, and F814W (SDSS -- g, broad V, and I). The foreground disk system (at z <= 0.06) shows a dusty disk much more extended than the starlight, with spiral lanes seen in extinction out to 1.5 R 25, approximately 6 half-light radii. This pair is the first where extinction can be mapped reliably out to this distance from the center. The spiral arms of the extended dust disk show typical extinction values of A F475W ~ 0.25, A F606W ~ 0.25, and A F814W ~ 0.15. The extinction law inferred from these measures is similar to that of the local Milky Way, and we show that the smoothing effects of sampling at limited spatial resolution (<57 pc, in these data) flattens the observed function through mixing of regions with different extinction. This galaxy illustrates the diversity of dust distributions in spirals, and the limitations of adopting a single dust model for optically similar galaxies. The ideal geometry of this pair of overlapping galaxies and the high sampling of HST data make this data set ideal to analyze this pair with three separate approaches to overlapping galaxies: (1) a combined fit, rotating copies of both galaxies, (2) a simple flip of the background image, and (3) an estimate of the original fluxes for the individual galaxies based on reconstructions of their proper isophotes. We conclude that in the case of high-quality data such as these, isophotal models are to be preferred},

	Abstract = {The study of the opacities of spiral galaxies is focused here on the optical depth in the blue band in the regions of the discs between the effective radius and the 26 mag arcsec^-2^ blue isophote. A sample of galaxies drawn from the ESO-LV catalogue is explored using completeness tests which employ the V/V_max_ technique. The results allow a comparison between results from various inclination tests that use different photometric parameters and sample selection criteria. For Sb-Sc galaxies, isophotal diameters do not increase with inclination in complete samples, but do so in incomplete samples. This result explains part of the diversity of the literature. An additional analysis, incorporating the effect of interlopers in a diameter-selected sample, employs log N-log diameter distributions and provides new results on the transparency in the outer regions for several central surface brightness `families' of Sb, Sc and Sd galaxies. These results and earlier findings match well, and suggest an average overall picture of the optical depth at various locations in the discs of these galaxies. Sb galaxies and high surface brightness galaxies of later type (Sc, Sd) are found to have low C values (optically thick, high internal extinctions) over the whole of their discs, while the fainter surface brightness Sc and Sd galaxies are best modelled with C= 0.5-0.6 at the effective radius (semi-transparent) and C = 0.7-0.9 at the 26 mag arcsec^-2^ isophote (nearly transparent). A relatively large optical depth and a corresponding low overall disc C value at the outer radii are best understood in terms of an obscuring component with a scaleheight of the same order as that of the stars and a scalelength larger than that of the stars. The IRAS 60-micron data are not really mapping this componen},

	Abstract = {Growing evidence for the existence of two classes of ellipticals calls for a comparison of the properties of their globular cluster systems. I compiled information on the properties of 53 globular cluster systems of faint and bright early-type galaxies, and investigated them in the light of the properties of the parent galaxies. The properties of globular cluster systems appear to separate into two classes rather than to follow continuous relations with their host galaxy properties. The "faint" systems have a low specific frequency (less than about 5), less than roughly 1500 globular clusters, a relatively low metallicity ([Fe/H]<-1.2), and a steep density profile that follows the galaxy light. These systems appear essentially unperturbed, and are hosted by faint (about M_V_>-21.5), disky early-type galaxies with unresolved cores. On the other hand, "bright" globular cluster systems had a higher efficiency in producing globular clusters and have higher specific frequencies (higher than 5). They have larger number of globular clusters (more than 2000), have flat density profiles (α>-1.7) and their color distributions are often broad, and show several peaks or gradients in many cases. Finally the mean metallicity is higher than in "faint" globular cluster systems. "Bright" globular cluster systems show all signs predicted for globular cluster systems that experienced a merger event, and are associated with bright (about M_V_<-21.5) boxy ellipticals with resolved cores. I conclude that every galaxy is likely to have formed globular clusters during the early proto-galactic collapse, but "bright" systems were enriched and disturbed during merger events. These two classes of globular cluster systems support the idea that major merger events could be a cause for the dichotomy of early-type galaxies.},

	Abstract = {Variations in the number of globular clusters per unit galaxy luminosity, which is the specific frequency, and the mass of globular clusters per unit total available mass, are reviewed. Correlations with galaxy luminosity and morphology, and with the properties of the associated galactic clusters are discussed, as are the color distributions of globular cluster populations. Several models for the origin of these variations are summarized, including the tidal stripping and interaction/starburst models. Most of the variations in the specific frequency for elliptical galaxies result from variations in the ratio of total mass to light with a nearly constant efficiency for conversion of gas into globular cluster mass. Smaller additional variations may come from tidal stripping, particularly in cD galaxies.},

The results, including luminosity profiles, photometric parameters, integrated luminosity distribution, ellipticity and position angle variation, are presented. The ellipticity and position angle variations reach up to 5 arc mins, much fainter than any previous study. The accuracy of the present data is checked by comparing them with the surface photometry in the literature. It is found that the zero-point about 0.12 mag brighter than the calibration of de Vaucouleurs and Capaccioli (1979), which agrees with the values 0.10-0.15 mag difference claimed by recent observations. The systematic differences is found to be less than about 0.1 mag.},

	Abstract = {We present images, integrated photometry, and surface-brightness and color profiles for a total of 1034 nearby galaxies recently observed by the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) satellite in its far-ultraviolet (FUV; λeff=1516 {\AA}) and near-ultraviolet (NUV; λeff=2267 {\AA}) bands. Our catalog of objects is derived primarily from the GALEX Nearby Galaxies Survey (NGS) supplemented by galaxies larger than 1' in diameter serendipitously found in these fields and in other GALEX exposures of similar of greater depth. The sample analyzed here adequately describes the distribution and full range of properties (luminosity, color, star formation rate [SFR]) of galaxies in the local universe. From the surface brightness profiles obtained we have computed asymptotic magnitudes, colors, and luminosities, along with the concentration indices C31 and C42. We have also morphologically classified the UV surface brightness profiles according to their shape. This data set has been complemented with archival optical, near-infrared, and far-infrared fluxes and colors. We find that the integrated (FUV-K) color provides robust discrimination between elliptical and spiral/irregular galaxies and also among spiral galaxies of different subtypes. Elliptical galaxies with brighter K-band luminosities (i.e., more massive) are redder in (NUV-K) color but bluer in (FUV-NUV) (a color sensitive to the presence of a strong UV upturn) than less massive ellipticals. In the case of the spiral/irregular galaxies our analysis shows the presence of a relatively tight correlation between the (FUV-NUV) color (or, equivalently, the slope of the UV spectrum, β) and the total infrared-to-UV ratio. The correlation found between (FUV-NUV) color and K-band luminosity (with lower luminosity objects being bluer than more luminous ones) can be explained as due to an increase in the dust content with galaxy luminosity. The images in this Atlas along with the profiles and integrated properties are publicly available through a dedicated Web page.},

	Abstract = {In this paper and a companion paper we present the DIRTY model, a Monte Carlo radiative transfer code, self-consistently including dust heating and emission and accounting for the effects of the transient heating of small grains. The code is completely general: the density structure of the dust, the number and type of heating sources, and their geometric configurations can be specified arbitrarily within the model space. Source photons are tracked through the scattering and absorbing medium using Monte Carlo techniques, and the effects of multiple scattering are included. The dust-scattering, -absorbing, and -emitting properties are calculated from realistic dust models derived by fitting observed extinction curves in Local Group galaxies, including the Magellanic Clouds and the Milky Way. The dust temperature and the emitted dust spectrum are calculated self-consistently from the absorbed energy, including the effects of temperature fluctuations in small grains. Dust self-absorption is also accounted for, allowing the treatment of high optical depths, by treating photons emitted by the dust as an additional heating source and adopting an iterative radiative transfer scheme. As an illustrative case, we apply the DIRTY radiative transfer code to starburst galaxies wherein the heating sources are derived from stellar evolutionary synthesis models. Within the context of the starburst model, we examine the dependence of the ultraviolet to far-infrared spectral energy distribution, dust temperatures, and dust masses predicted by DIRTY on variations of the input parameters.},

	Abstract = {We present the DIRTY (DustI Radiative Transfer, Yeah!) radiative transfer model in this paper and a companion paper. This model computes the polarized radiative transfer of photons from arbitrary distributions of stars through arbitrary distributions of dust using Monte Carlo techniques. The dust re-emission is done self-consistently with the dust absorption and scattering and includes all three important emission paths: equilibrium thermal emission, nonequilibrium thermal emission, and the aromatic features emission. The algorithm used for the radiative transfer allows for the efficient computation of the appearance of a model system as seen from any viewing direction. We present a simple method for computing an upper limit on the output quantity uncertainties for Monte Carlo radiative transfer models that use the weighted photon approach.},

In particular, we present the full asymptotic expansion for the dimensionless scale factor b(m) that is introduced when referring the profile to the standard effective radius. Surprisingly, our asymptotic analysis turns out to be useful even for values of m as low as unity, thus providing a unified analytical tool for observational and theoretical investigations based on the R1/m law for the entire range of interesting photometric profiles, from spiral to elliptical galaxies.},

	Abstract = {Using the standard dynamical theory of spherical systems, we calculate the properties of spherical galaxies and clusters whose density profiles obey the universal form first obtained in high-resolution cosmological N-body simulations by Navarro, Frenk & White (NFW). We adopt three models for the internal kinematics: isotropic velocities, constant anisotropy and increasingly radial Osipkov-Merritt anisotropy. Analytical solutions are found for the radial dependence of the mass, gravitational potential, velocity dispersion, energy and virial ratio and we test their variability with the concentration parameter describing the density profile and amount of velocity anisotropy. We also compute structural parameters, such as half-mass radius, effective radius and various measures of concentration. Finally, we derive projected quantities, the surface mass density and line-of-sight as well as aperture-velocity dispersion, all of which can be directly applied in observational tests of current scenarios of structure formation. On the mass scales of galaxies, if constant mass-to-light is assumed, the NFW surface density profile is found to fit Hubble-Reynolds laws well. It is also well fitted by S{\'e}rsic R1/m laws, for m~=3, but in a much narrower range of m and with much larger effective radii than are observed. Assuming in turn reasonable values of the effective radius, the mass density profiles imply a mass-to-light ratio that increases outwards at all radii.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the dependence of the total-IR (TIR) to ultraviolet (UV) luminosity ratio method for calculating the UV dust attenuation A(UV) from the age of the underlying stellar populations by using a library of spectral energy distributions for galaxies with different star formation histories. Our analysis confirms that the TIR/UV versus A(UV) relation varies significantly with the age of the underlying stellar population: that is, for the same TIR/UV ratio, systems with low specific star formation rate (SSFR) suffer a lower UV attenuation than starbursts. Using a sample of nearby field and cluster spiral galaxies, we show that the use of a standard (i.e. age-independent) TIR/UV versus A(UV) relation leads to a systematic overestimate up to 2 mag of the amount of UV dust attenuation suffered by objects with low SSFR and in particular HI-deficient star-forming cluster galaxies. This result points out that the age-independent TIR/UV versus A(UV) relation cannot be used to study the UV properties of large samples of galaxies including low star-forming systems and passive spirals. Therefore, we give some simple empirical relations from which the UV attenuation can be estimated taking into account its dependence on the age of the stellar populations, providing a less biased view of UV properties of galaxies.},

	Abstract = {A total of 730 discrete dust clouds in M31 is identified and some of their characteristics are catalogued. In size, the dust clouds resemble the LMC sample, though they span a larger range, all the way from the resolution limit up to over 2 kpc. Both in size and in complexity of structure they are like the 'large dust complexes' of the Galaxy. The number density of clouds falls off steeply with radius, as nearly the inverse first power of the distance from the nucleus, measured in the plane of the galaxy. They virtually all lie within 50 arcmin of the center. Comparison with high-resolution H I maps shows surprisingly poor agreement. Although the dust and gas seem to agree in position in the NE and SE quadrants, they are almost anticorrelated in the other two quadrants. Furthermore, contrary to expectation, a rectified face-on map of the positions of the dust clouds shows no discernible spiral structure.},

	Abstract = {Large-scale dust heating and cooling in the diffuse medium of M31 is studied using the high-resolution (HiRes) IRAS maps in conjunction with UV, optical (UBV), and H I maps. A dust heating/cooling model is developed based on a radiative transfer model which assumes a "sandwich" configuration of dust and stars and takes fully into account the effect of scattering of dust grains. The model is applied to a complete sample of "cells" (small areas of size 2' x 2') generated from the above maps. The sample covers the M3 1 disk in the galactocentric radius range 2-14 kpc and includes only the cells for which the contribution of the discrete sources to the 60 microns surface brightness is negligible (<20%). This effectively excludes most of the bright arm regions from our analysis. We find the following:
1. The mean optical depth (viewed from the inclination angle of 77$\,^{\circ}$) increases with radius from τν ∼0.7 at r = 2 kpc outward, reaches a peak of ∼1.6 near 10 kpc, and stays quite flat out to 14 kpc, where the signal falls below the 5 σ level.

2. A correlation between τν and H I surface density is suggested by the similarity between their radial profiles. Significant differences are found between the radial profiles of the H2 gas (estimated from CO) and of the dust (from τν), which are most probably caused by the large uncertainty in the CO-to-H2 conversion factor, and to the underrepresentation of H2-rich regions in the sample of cells of diffuse regions.

3. The τν/N(H I) ratio decreases with increasing radius in the disk of M31, with an exponential law fit yielding an e-folding scale length of 9.6 + 0.4 kpc.

4. The optical depth adjusted for this gradient, τν,c is strongly and linearly correlated with N(H I) over 1.5 orders of magnitude of column density, indicating that at a given radius r the dust column density is proportional to the H I gas column density, with the proportionality factor decreasing with increasing r.

5. With the assumption that the ratio of τν to dust column density is the same as that in the solar neighborhood, the portion of the M31 disk at radii between 2 and 14 kpc contains 1.9$\pm$0.6 × 107 Msun of dust, yielding a global dust-to-total gas mass ratio of 9.0$\pm$2.7 × 10-3, very close to solar neighborhood value.

6. The nonionizing UV radiation, mainly caused by B stars (4-20 Msun), contributes only 27% of the heating of the diffuse dust in M31. Throughout the M31 disk, heating of the diffuse dust is dominated by optical radiation from stars at least a billion years old.},

	Abstract = {Models for the transfer of ultraviolet, visual, and near-infrared radiation within a variety of spherical geometries are presented which are intended to approximate different types of dusty environments within galaxies. Objects approximated by these models include normal and 'starbust galaxies', active galactic nuclei and QSOs, colliding systems with a widely dispersed interstellar medium, and elliptical galaxies. The models are based on a complete spherically symmetric 3D Monte Carlo simulation which covers a large range of dust optical depths for 10 photometric bands. It is calculated that 'bluing' due to scattering partially compensates for reddening by extinction. It is considered to be an effective process that reduces some observational consequencies of large amounts of dust so that common techniques for estimating the amount of dust fail by large factors.},

	Abstract = {In this Paper I present a new two-dimensional decomposition technique, which models the surface photometry of a galaxy with an exponential light profile for both bulge and disk and, when necessary, with a Freeman bar. The new technique was tested for systematic errors on both artificial and real data and compared with widely used one-dimensional decomposition techniques, where the luminosity profile of the galaxy is used. The comparisons indicate that a decomposition of the two-dimensional image of the galaxy with an exponential light profile for both bulge and disk yields the most reproducible and representative bulge and disk parameters. An extensive error analysis was made to determine the reliability of the model parameters. If the model with an exponential bulge profile is a reasonable description of a galaxy, the maximum errors in the derived model parameters are of order 20%. The uncertainties in the model parameters will increase, if the exponential bulge function is replaced by other often used bulge functions as the de Vaucouleurs law. All decomposition methods were applied to the optical and near-infrared data set presented by de Jong & van der Kruit (1994), which comprises 86 galaxies in six passbands.},

	Abstract = {We present accurate surface photometry in the B, V, R, I, H and K passbands of 86 spiral galaxies. The galaxies in this statistically complete sample of undisturbed spirals were selected from the UGC to have minimum diameters of 2' and minor over major axis ratios larger than 0.625. This sample has been selected in such a way that it can be used to represent a volume limited sample. The observation and reduction techniques are described in detail, especially the not often used driftscan technique for CCDs and the relatively new techniques using near-infrared (near-IR) arrays. For each galaxy we present radial profiles of surface brightness. Using these profiles we calculated the integrated magnitudes of the galaxies in the different passbands. We performed internal and external consistency checks for the magnitudes as well as the luminosity profiles. The internal consistency is well within the estimated errors. Comparisons with other authors indicate that measurements from photographic plates can show large deviations in the zero-point magnitude. Our surface brightness profiles agree within the errors with other CCD measurements. The comparison of integrated magnitudes shows a large scatter, but a consistent zero-point. These measurements will be used in a series of forthcoming papers to discuss central surface brightnesses, scalelengths, colors and color gradients of disks of spiral galaxies.},

	Abstract = {The stellar and dust content of spiral galaxies as function of radius has been investigated using near-infrared and optical broadband surface photometry of 86 face-on spiral galaxies. Colors of galaxies correlate with the azimuthally averaged local surface brightness both within and among galaxies, with the lower surface brightness regions being bluer. The colors formed from different passband combinations correlate strongly indicating that they probably arise from the same physical process. A 3D radiative transfer model was developed to calculate the effect of dust absorption and scattering on the luminosity and color profiles of galaxies. Stellar synthesis models were used to investigate the effects of the star formation history and the metallicity on the broadband color profiles. Combining all optical and near-infrared data shows that the color gradients in this sample of face-on galaxies are best explained by a combined stellar age and metallicity gradient across the disk, with the outer regions being on average younger and of lower metallicity. Dust reddening probably plays only a minor role, as the dust models cannot produce reddening profiles that are compatible with the observations. The observed color differences implicate substantial M/Llambda_ differences, both within galaxies and among galaxies. The variations are such that the "missing light" problem derived from rotation fitting becomes even worse. Late-type galaxies (T>=6) have lower metallicities and are often of younger average age than earlier types and have therefore an entirely different M/Llambda_ in most passbands. The near-infrared passbands are recommended for studies where the M/Llambda_ ratios should not vary too much.},

@article{Dutton:2007,
	Abstract = {We use observed rotation velocity-luminosity (VL) and size-luminosity (RL) relations to single out a specific scenario for disk galaxy formation in the ΛCDM cosmology. Our model involves four independent lognormal random variables: dark halo concentration c, disk spin λgal, disk mass fraction mgal, and stellar mass-to-light ratio ΥI. A simultaneous match of the VL and RL zero points with adiabatic contraction requires low-c halos, but this model has V2.2~1.8Vvir (where V2.2 and Vvir are the circular velocity at 2.2 disk scale lengths and the virial radius, respectively), which will be unable to match the luminosity function (LF). Similarly models without adiabatic contraction but standard c also predict high values of V2.2/Vvir. Models in which disk formation induces an expansion rather than the commonly assumed contraction of the dark matter halos have V2.2~1.2Vvir, which allows a simultaneous fit of the LF. This may result from nonspherical, clumpy gas accretion, where dynamical friction transfers energy from the gas to the dark matter. This model requires low λgal and mgal values, contrary to naive expectations. However, the low λgal is consistent with the notion that disk galaxies predominantly survive in halos with a quiet merger history, while a low mgal is also indicated by galaxy-galaxy lensing. The smaller than expected scatter in the RL relation and the lack of correlation between the residuals of the VL and RL relations, respectively, imply that the scatter in λgal and in c needs to be smaller than predicted for ΛCDM halos, again consistent with the idea that disk galaxies preferentially reside in halos with a quiet merger history.},

	Abstract = {We analyze the photometric properties of a sample of Sbc-Sc galaxies with known redshifts, single-dish H I profiles, and Charge Coupled Device (CCD) I band images. We derive laws that relate the measured isophotal radius at muI = 23.5, magnitude, scale length, and H I flux to the face-on aspect. We find spiral galaxies to be substantially less transparent than suggested in most previous determinations, but not as opaque as claimed by Valentijn (1990). Regions in the disk farther than two or three scale lengths from the center are close to completely transparent. In addition to statistically derived relations for the inclination dependence of photometric parameters, we present the results of a modeling exercise that utilizes the 'triplex' model of Disney et al. (1989) to obtain upper limits of the disk opacity. Within the framework of that model, and with qualitative consideration of the effects of scattering on extinction, we estimate late spiral disks at I band to have central optical depths tauI(0) less than 5 and dust absorbing layers with scale heights on the order of half that of the stellar component or less. We discuss our results in light of previous determinations of internal extinction relations and point out the substantial impact of internal extinction on the scatter of the Tully-Fisher relation. We also find that the visual diameters by which large catalogs are constructed (UGC, ESO-Uppsala) are nearly proportional to face-on isophotal diameters.},

The principal tests described involve minimization of the scatter in four distance-independent combinations of the observable parameters. The tests are applied in an attempt to resolve the diameter scale problem and to optimize the procedures that correct luminosities and diameters as functions of galaxy tilt and local obscuration.

	Abstract = {As part of a continuing program to estimate the distances to planetary nebulae (PNe), we have applied an expansion parallax algorithm to four objects: NGC 2392, NGC 3242, NGC 6210, and NGC 6572. The algorithm requires two Epochs of data obtained at the VLA at λ6 cm. With 6 years between Epochs, we have measured the angular expansion rate of three of the above PNe, NGC 6572, NGC 6210, and NGC 3242 with errors of 20, 25, and 40%, respectively. We did not detect the expansion of NGC 2392, but were able to ascertain an upper limit to the expansion rate. By combining the detected angular expansion rate with the Doppler expansion velocity and assuming uniform expansion, we have directly computed the distances to NGC 6572, NGC 6210, and NGC 3242 with accuracies that represent significant improvements over the current estimates in the literature. For most of the nebulae thus surveyed, our expansion parallax distances are all at least as large as recent Shklovsky distances determined by statistical methods.},

	Abstract = {We show that using mid-IR color selection to find active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is as effective in dense stellar fields such as the Magellanic Clouds as it is in extragalactic fields with low stellar densities using comparisons between the Spitzer Deep Wide Field Survey data for the NOAO Deep Wide Field Survey B{\"o}otes region and the SAGE Survey of the Large Magellanic Cloud. We use this to build high-purity catalogs of ~5000 AGN candidates behind the Magellanic Clouds. Once confirmed, these quasars will expand the available astrometric reference sources for the Clouds and the numbers of quasars with densely sampled, long-term (>decade) monitoring light curves by well over an order of magnitude and potentially identify sufficiently bright quasars for absorption line studies of the interstellar medium of the Clouds.},

	Abstract = {We describe TRILEGAL, a new populations synthesis code for simulating the stellar photometry of any Galaxy field. The code attempts to improve upon several technical aspects of star count models, by: dealing with very complete input libraries of evolutionary tracks; using a stellar spectral library to simulate the photometry in virtually any broad-band system; being very versatile allowing easy changes in the input libraries and in the description of all of its ingredients - like the star formation rate, age-metallicity relation, initial mass function, and geometry of Galaxy components. In a previous paper (Groenewegen et al. 2002, Paper I), the code was first applied to describe the very deep star counts of the CDFS stellar catalogue. Here, we briefly describe its initial calibration using EIS-deep and DMS star counts, which, as we show, are adequate samples to probe both the halo and the disc components of largest scale heights (oldest ages). We then present the changes in the calibration that were necessary to cope with some improvements in the model input data, and the use of more extensive photometry datasets: now the code is shown to successfully simulate also the relatively shallower 2MASS catalogue, which probes mostly the disc at intermediate ages, and the immediate solar neighbourhood as sampled by Hipparcos - in particular its absolute magnitude versus colour diagram -, which contains a somewhat larger fraction of younger stars than deeper surveys. Remarkably, the same model calibration can reproduce well the star counts in all the above-mentioned data sets, that span from the very deep magnitudes of CDFS (16<R<23) to the very shallow ones of Hipparcos (V<8). Significant deviations (above 50 percent in number counts) are found just for fields close to the Galactic Center (since no bulge component was included) and Plane, and for a single set of South Galactic Pole data. The TRILEGAL code is ready to use for the variety of wide-angle surveys in the optical/infrared that will become available in the coming years.},

@article{Gilbert:2009,
	Abstract = {Extensive photometric and spectroscopic surveys of the Andromeda galaxy (M31) have discovered tidal debris features throughout M31's stellar halo. We present stellar kinematics and metallicities in fields with identified substructure from our on-going SPLASH survey of M31 red giant branch stars with the DEIMOS spectrograph on the Keck II 10 m telescope. Radial velocity criteria are used to isolate members of the kinematically cold substructures. The substructures are shown to be metal-rich relative to the rest of the dynamically hot stellar population in the fields in which they are found. We calculate the mean metallicity and average surface brightness of the various kinematical components in each field, and show that, on average, higher surface brightness features tend to be more metal-rich than lower surface brightness features. Simulations of stellar halo formation via accretion in a cosmological context are used to illustrate that the observed trend can be explained as a natural consequence of the observed dwarf galaxy mass-metallicity relation. A significant spread in metallicity at a given surface brightness is seen in the data; we show that this is due to time effects, namely, the variation in the time since accretion of the tidal streams' progenitor onto the host halo. We show that in this theoretical framework a relationship between the alpha-enhancement and surface brightness of tidal streams is expected, which arises from the varying times of accretion of the progenitor satellites onto the host halo. Thus, measurements of the alpha-enrichment, metallicity, and surface brightness of tidal debris can be used to reconstruct the luminosity and time of accretion onto the host halo of the progenitors of tidal streams.},

	Abstract = {Since the Hipparcos mission and recent large scale surveys in the optical and the near-infrared, new constraints have been obtained on the structure and evolution history of the Milky Way. The population synthesis approach is a useful tool to interpret such data sets and to test scenarios of evolution of the Galaxy. We present here new constraints on evolution parameters obtained from the Besan{\c c}on model of population synthesis and analysis of optical and near-infrared star counts. The Galactic potential is computed self-consistently, in agreement with Hipparcos results and the observed rotation curve. Constraints are posed on the outer bulge structure, the warped and flared disc, the thick disc and the spheroid populations. The model is tuned to produce reliable predictions in the visible and the near-infrared in wide photometric bands from U to K. Finally, we describe applications such as photometric and astrometric simulations and a new classification tool based on a Bayesian probability estimator, which could be used in the framework of Virtual Observatories. As examples, samples of simulated star counts at different wavelengths and directions are also given.},

	Abstract = {A comprehensive study of the measurement of star formation histories from colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) is presented, with an emphasis on a variety of subtle issues involved in the generation of model CMDs and maximum likelihood solution. Among these are the need for a complete sampling of the synthetic CMD, the use of proper statistics for dealing with Poisson-distributed data (and a demonstration of why χ 2 must not be used), measuring full uncertainties in all reported parameters, quantifying the goodness-of-fit, and questions of binning the CMD and incorporating outside information. Several example star formation history measurements are given. Two examples involve synthetic data, in which the input and recovered parameters can be compared to locate possible flaws in the methodology (none were apparent) and measure the accuracy with which ages, metallicities and star formation rates can be recovered. Solutions of the histories of seven Galactic dwarf spheroidal companions (Carina, Draco, Leo I, Leo II, Sagittarius, Sculptor and Ursa Minor) illustrate the ability to measure star formation histories given a variety of conditions - numbers of stars, complexity of star formation history and amount of foreground contamination. Significant measurements of ancient >8Gyr star formation are made in all seven galaxies. Sculptor, Draco and Ursa Minor appear entirely ancient, while the other systems show varying amounts of younger stars.},

	Abstract = {Context: Wide-field {JHK}s near-infrared observations covering an area of 1.8$\,^{\circ}$ × 1.8$\,^{\circ}$ centred on M 33 were obtained using WFCAM at UKIRT. These data show a large population of intermediate-age asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. Aims: We have used both C-type and M-type AGB stars to determine spatial variations in metallicity and mean age across the galaxy. Methods: We distinguished between C-type and M-type AGB stars from their location in the colour-magnitude diagram (J-K_s, K_s). The distribution of these stars is supported by a cross-identification between our sample and a catalogue of optically confirmed, long-period variable stars, as well as with the list of sources detected by Spitzer in the mid-infrared. We calculated the C/M ratio and the orientation of the galaxy in the sky, and compared the Ks magnitude distribution with theoretical distributions spanning a range of metallicities and star formation rates (SFRs). Results: The C/M ratio surface map confirms a metallicity gradient in the galaxy corresponding to a spread in [Fe/H] =0.6 dex with substructures in the inner and outer galaxy. Magnitude and colour variations suggest orientation and extinction effects on the galaxy disc. Maps showing the distribution of mean age and metallicity obtained from the Ks method suggest that: the outer galaxy disc/halo is metal poorer than the nuclear region and metal-rich clumps in the inner galaxy change location with time. The average outer ring and nuclear stellar population is 6 Gyr old while central regions are a few Gyr younger.

	Abstract = {New methodology and associated software techniques for use when performing two-dimensional aperture photometry with data from areal detectors are presented. It is shown that applying simple Poisson statistics to point sources only works in certain limited regimes and that for many situations the 'CCD equation' must be employed to get accurate results. Sky or background subtraction is again found to be of critical importance and, of five background estimation methods tried, each had some difficulties in producing a 'correct' background value. CCD growth curves are introduced as a means of correcting the flux from faint or crowded sources, when measured with very small (optimum) apertures. These optimum apertures are of interest as they are shown to give large increases in S/N for point-source observations. The usage of these small apertures along with CCD growth curves is discussed and presented with emphasis on their use for time-resolved CCD photometry.},

	Abstract = {The central brightness cusps seen in some globular clusters are thought to be the relics of a gravothermal core collapse that occurred sometime in the clusters' past. Recent observations show that the centers of such clusters are bluer than their outskirts, indicating that the stellar populations there are somehow different than those farther out, presumably as a result of unusual physical processes that took place in these extremely dense regions. Here I analyze a large body of digital imagery from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope and the Hubble Space Telescope to obtain color-magnitude and color-color diagrams for stars in the central two arcminutes of the prototypical core-cusp globular cluster M15 = NGC 7078 = C 2127 + 119. These data were reduced with a new computer program, named ALLFRAME, that is described in detail here for the first time. ALLFRAME makes simultaneous use of the geometric and photometric information from all images of a given field to derive a self-consistent set of positions and magnitudes for all detected starlike objects in that area of sky, thereby extending the range of magnitude and crowding conditions for which useful photometry is obtainable. I tentatively conclude that the color gradient in M15 is due to three distinct effects: (1) there is a deficiency of the brightest red giants in the central regions of the cluster; (2) the giant branch of the dominant cluster population shifts systematically toward the blue as the center of the cluster is approached; and (3) the very center of the cluster (radius approximately equal or less than 12 seconds) contains a large population of blue and yellow stragglers that occupy the area of the color-magnitude diagram between the main-sequence turnoff and the horizontal branch and between the extended blue horizontal branch and the subgiant branch; many of these appear to have a significant ultraviolet excess.},

	Abstract = {A table is presented that summarizes published absorption line measurements for the high- and intermediate-velocity clouds (HVCs and IVCs). New values are derived for N(H I) in the direction of observed probes, in order to arrive at reliable abundances and abundance limits (the H I data are described in Paper II). Distances to stellar probes are revisited and calculated consistently, in order to derive distance brackets or limits for many of the clouds, taking care to properly interpret nondetections. The main conclusions are the following. (1) Absolute abundances have been measured using lines of S II, N I, and O I, with the following resulting values: ~0.1 solar for one HVC (complex C), ~0.3 solar for the Magellanic Stream, ~0.5 solar for a southern IVC, and ~solar for two northern IVCs (the IV Arch and LLIV Arch). Finally, approximate values in the range 0.5-2 solar are found for three more IVCs. (2) Depletion patterns in IVCs are like those in warm disk or halo gas. (3) Most distance limits are based on strong UV lines of C II, Si II, and Mg II, a few on Ca II. Distance limits for major HVCs are greater than 5 kpc, while distance brackets for several IVCs are in the range 0.5-2 kpc. (4) Mass limits for major IVCs are 0.5-8×105 Msolar, but for major HVCs they are more than 106 Msolar. (5) The Ca II/H I ratio varies by up to a factor 2-5 within a single cloud, somewhat more between clouds. (6) The Na I/H I ratio varies by a factor of more than 10 within a cloud, and even more between clouds. Thus, Ca II can be useful for determining both lower and upper distance limits, but Na I only yields upper limits.},

	Abstract = {We present reliable measurements of the metallicity distribution function (MDF) at different points along the tidal stream of the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxy, based on high-resolution, echelle spectroscopy of candidate M giant members of the Sgr system. The Sgr MDF is found to evolve significantly from a median [Fe/H]~-0.4 in the core to ~-1.1 dex over a Sgr leading arm length representing ~2.5-3.0 Gyr of dynamical (i.e., tidal stripping) age. This is direct evidence that there can be significant chemical differences between current dSph satellites and the bulk of the stars they have contributed to the halo. Our results suggest that Sgr experienced a significant change in binding energy over the past several gigayears, which has substantially decreased its tidal boundary across a radial range over which there must have been a significant metallicity gradient in the progenitor galaxy. By accounting for MDF variation along the debris arms, we approximate the MDF Sgr would have had several gigayears ago. We also analyze the MDF of a moving group of M giants we previously discovered toward the north Galactic cap. These objects have the opposite radial velocities to the infalling Sgr leading arm stars there, and we propose that most of them represent Sgr trailing arm stars overlapping the Sgr leading arm in this part of the sky. If so, these trailing arm stars further demonstrate the strong MDF evolution within the Sgr stream.},

@article{Orban:2008,
	Abstract = {The paucity of observed dwarf galaxies in the Local Group relative to the abundance of predicted dark matter halos remains one of the greatest puzzles of the ΛCDM paradigm. Solving this puzzle now requires not only matching the numbers of objects but also understanding the details of their star formation histories. We present a summary of such histories derived from the HST data using the color-magnitude diagram fitting method. To reduce observational uncertainties, we condense the data into five cumulative parameters: the fractions of stellar mass formed in the last 1, 2, 5, and 10 Gyr, and the mean stellar age. We interpret the new data with a phenomenological model based on the mass assembly histories of dark matter halos and the Schmidt law of star formation. The model correctly predicts the radial distribution of the dwarfs and the fractions of stars formed in the last 5 and 10 Gyr. However, in order to be consistent with the observations, the model requires a significant amount of recent star formation in the last 2 Gyr. Within the framework of our model, this prolonged star formation can be achieved by adding a stochastic variation in the density threshold of the star formation law. The model results are not sensitive to late gas accretion, the slope of the Schmidt law, or the details of cosmic reionization. A few discrepancies still remain: our model typically predicts too large stellar masses, only a modest population of ultrafaint dwarfs, and a small number of dwarfs with anomalously young stellar populations. Nevertheless, the observed star formation histories of Local Group dwarfs are generally consistent the expected star formation in cold dark matter halos.},

Also obtained are the density laws with distance from the Galactic plane for each absolute magnitude. The 300 pc scale height component is identified as an old disk, and the 1350 pc scale height component as a Galactic 'thick disk'. The luminosity function and density law of the thick disk are consistent with a substantial flattening of the spheroid isodensity contours by the gravitational potential of the Galactic disk, in agreement with recent observations of several external galaxies.},

	Abstract = {Recent HI observations reveal that the discs of spiral galaxies are surrounded by extended gaseous haloes. This extraplanar gas reaches large distances (several kiloparsecs) from the disc and shows peculiar kinematics (low rotation and inflow). We have modelled the extraplanar gas as a continuous flow of material from the disc of a spiral galaxy into its halo region. The output of our models is pseudo data cubes that can be directly compared to the HI data. We have applied these models to two spiral galaxies (NGC 891 and NGC 2403) known to have a substantial amount of extraplanar gas. Our models are able to reproduce accurately the vertical distribution of extraplanar gas for an energy input corresponding to a small fraction (<4 per cent) of the energy released by supernovae. However, they fail in two important aspects: (1) they do not reproduce the right gradient in rotation velocity; (2) they predict a general outflow of the extraplanar gas, contrary to what is observed. We show that neither of these difficulties can be removed if clouds are ionized and invisible at 21cm as they leave the disc but become visible at some point on their orbits. We speculate that these failures indicate the need for accreted material from the intergalactic medium that could provide the low angular momentum and inflow required.},

	Abstract = {We present evidence for cosmological gas accretion on to spiral galaxies in the local universe. The accretion is seen through its effects on the dynamics of the extraplanar neutral gas. The accretion rates that we estimate for two nearby spiral galaxies are of the order of their star formation rates. Our model shows that most of the extraplanar gas is produced by supernova feedback (galactic fountain) and only 10-20 per cent comes from accretion. The accreting material must have low specific angular momentum about the disc's spin axis, although the magnitude of the specific angular momentum vector can be higher. We also explore the effects of a hot corona on the dynamics of the extraplanar gas and find that it is unlikely to be responsible for the observed kinematical pattern and the source of accreted gas. However, the interaction with the fountain flow should profoundly affect the hydrodynamics of the corona.},

	Abstract = {We report results from a survey of high-velocity clouds (HVCs) and the Magellanic Stream (MS) for faint, diffuse optical recombination emission lines. We detect Hα emission with surface brightness from 41 to 1680 mR from HVCs, and from <40 to 1360 mR in the MS. A simple model for the photo-ionizing radiation emergent from the Galaxy, normalized to the HVCs A and M with known distances, predicts distances from a few to 40 kpc, placing the faintest HVCs in the Galactic halo, too far away for a Galactic fountain. This model cannot explain the bright and spatially varying Hα in the Magellanic Stream, which requires another source of ionization. However, we do not find any HVCs super-faint in Hα even with another ionization source, we conclude that the detected HVCs are not more than 2-4 times the distance of the MS (100-200 kpc).},

	Abstract = {We use the ``Via Lactea'' simulation to study the co-evolution of a Milky Way-sized ΛCDM halo and its subhalo population. While most of the host halo mass is accreted over the first 6 Gyr in a series of major mergers, the physical mass distribution [not Mvir(z)] remains practically constant since z=1. The same is true in a large sample of ΛCDM galaxy halos. Subhalo mass loss peaks between the turnaround and virialization epochs of a given mass shell, and the abundance of substructure within the shell freezes afterward. Of the z=1 subhalos, 97% have a surviving bound remnant at the present epoch. The retained mass fraction is larger for initially lighter subhalos: today satellites with maximum circular velocities Vmax=10 km s-1 at z=1 have about 40% of the mass they had back then. At the first pericenter passage a larger average mass fraction is lost than during each following orbit. Tides remove mass in the substructure from the outside in, leading to higher concentrations compared to field halos of the same mass. This effect, combined with the earlier formation epoch of the inner satellites, results in strongly increasing subhalo concentrations toward the Galactic center. We present individual evolutionary tracks and present-day properties of the likely hosts of the dwarf satellites around the Milky Way. The formation histories of ``field halos'' that lie beyond the Via Lactea host today are found to strongly depend on the density of their environment. This is caused by tidal mass loss that affects many field halos on eccentric orbits.},

	Abstract = {We review evidence that the census of Milky Way satellites similar to those known may be incomplete at low latitude due to obscuration and in the outer halo due to a decreasing sensitivity to dwarf satellites with distance. We evaluate the possible impact that incompleteness has on comparisons with substructure models by estimating corrections to the known number of dwarfs using empirical and theoretical models. Under the assumption that the true distribution of Milky Way satellites is uniform with latitude, we estimate a 33 per cent incompleteness in the total number of dwarfs due to obscuration at low latitude. Similarly, if the radial distribution of Milky Way satellites matches that of M31, or that of the oldest sub-haloes or the most massive sub-haloes in a simulation, then we estimate a total number of Milky Way dwarfs ranging from 1-3 times the known population. Although the true level of incompleteness is quite uncertain, the fact that our extrapolations yield average total numbers of MW dwarfs that are realistically 1.5-2 times the known population shows that incompleteness needs to be taken seriously when comparing models of dwarf galaxy formation. Interestingly, the radial distribution of the oldest sub-haloes in a ΛCDM simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy is a close match to the observed distribution of M31's satellites, which suggests that reionization may be an important factor controlling the observability of sub-haloes. We also assess the prospects for a new SDSS search for Milky Way satellites to constrain the possible incompleteness in the outer halo.},

	Abstract = {A specialized data-mining algorithm has been developed using wide-field photometry catalogs, enabling systematic and efficient searches for resolved, extremely low surface brightness satellite galaxies in the halo of the Milky Way (MW). Tested and calibrated with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 6 (SDSS-DR6) we recover all 15 MW satellites recently detected in SDSS, six known MW/Local Group dSphs in the SDSS footprint, and 19 previously known globular and open clusters. In addition, 30 point-source overdensities have been found that correspond to no cataloged objects. The detection efficiencies of the algorithm have been carefully quantified by simulating more than three million model satellites embedded in star fields typical of those observed in SDSS, covering a wide range of parameters including galaxy distance, scale length, luminosity, and Galactic latitude. We present several parameterizations of these detection limits to facilitate comparison between the observed MW satellite population and predictions. We find that all known satellites would be detected with >90% efficiency over all latitudes spanned by DR6 and that the MW satellite census within DR6 is complete to a magnitude limit of MV ≈ --6.5 and a distance of 300 kpc. Assuming all existing MW satellites contain an appreciable old stellar population and have sizes and luminosities comparable with currently known companions, we predict lower and upper limit totals of 52 and 340 MW dwarf satellites within ~260 kpc if they are uniformly distributed across the sky. This result implies that many MW satellites still remain undetected. Identifying and studying these elusive satellites in future survey data will be fundamental to test the dark matter distribution on kpc scales.},

	Abstract = {We present MMT/Megacam imaging in Sloan g and r of the extremely low luminosity Bo{\"o}tes II Milky Way companion. We use a bootstrap approach to perform robust measurements of, and to calculate uncertainties on, Bo{\"o}tes II's distance, luminosity, size, and morphology. Comparisons with theoretical isochrones and empirical globular cluster fiducials show that Bo{\"o}tes II's stellar population is old and metal-poor ([Fe/H]<~-2). Assuming a stellar population like that of M92, Bo{\"o}tes II is at a distance of 42+/-2 kpc, closer than the initial published estimate of 60+/-10 kpc. This distance revision, combined with a more robust measurement of Bo{\"o}tes II's structure with both a Plummer model and an exponential model, results in more compact inferred physical half-light sizes of rh~=36+/-9 and 33+/-10 pc, respectively, and lower-limit inferred luminosities of MV~=-2.4+/-0.7 and -2.2+/-0.7 mag, respectively. Our revised size and luminosity calculations move Bo{\"o}tes II into a region of size-luminosity space not previously known to be occupied by old stellar populations, but also occupied by the recently discovered Milky Way satellites Willman 1 and Segue 1. We show that the apparently distorted morphology of Bo{\"o}tes II is not statistically significant given the present data. We use a tidal argument to support a scenario in which Bo{\"o}tes II is a dwarf galaxy (dark matter-dominated) rather than a globular cluster (not dark matter-dominated), although our inferred uncertainty on the M/L for Bo{\"o}tes II is substantial. Moreover, we cannot rule out the possibility that Bo{\"o}tes II is a star cluster on the verge of disruption like Palomar 5.},

	Abstract = {We quantify the detectability of stellar Milky Way satellites in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 5. We show that the effective search volumes for the recently discovered SDSS satellites depend strongly on their luminosity, with their maximum distance, Dmax, substantially smaller than the Milky Way halo's virial radius. Calculating the maximum accessible volume, Vmax, for all faint detected satellites allows the calculation of the luminosity function for Milky Way satellite galaxies, accounting quantitatively for their detectability. We find that the number density of satellite galaxies continues to rise toward low luminosities, but may flatten at MV~-5 within the uncertainties, the luminosity function can be described by a single power law dN/dMV=10×100.1(MV+5), spanning luminosities from MV=-2 all the way to the luminosity of the Large Magellanic Cloud. In comparing these results to several semianalytic galaxy formation models, we find that their predictions differ significantly from the data: either the shape of the luminosity function or the model's surface brightness distribution does not match.},

	Abstract = {The formation of dwarf, diffuse, metal-poor galaxies as a result of supernova-driven winds is reexamined in view of the accumulating data on the systematic properties of dwarfs in the Local Group and in the Virgo Cluster. The observed luminosity-radius-metallicity relations are found to be produced naturally inside dominant halos, with a mass-radius relation that resembles the predictions of the "cold" dark matter cosmological scenario. The critical condition for global gas loss as a result of the first burst of star formation is that the virial velocity be below a critical value on the order of 100 km s-1. In any hierarchial scenario for galaxy formation, this condition leads to two distinct classes of galaxies as observed: (1) the diffuse dwarfs which mostly originate from typical density perturbations; and (2) the normal, brighter galaxies which can originate only from the highest density peaks. This provides a statistical biasing mechanism for the preferential formation of bright galaxies in denser regions (clusters and superclusters).},

@article{Kauffmann:1993,
	Abstract = {We construct semi-analytic models for galaxy formation within the framework of a hierarchical clustering scenario for structure formation in the Universe. We use the algorithm of Kauffmann & White to generate ensembles of merging histories for present-day dark matter haloes with a wide range of circular velocities. A galaxy is assumed to form from gas which cools and turns into stars at the centre of a halo until that halo merges with a more massive object. At this time the galaxy loses its source of new gas and becomes a non-dominant object within a larger group or cluster. Our methods thus enable us to `look inside' present dark matter haloes and investigate the formation, evolution and merging of the galaxies that they contain. We begin by investigating the properties of haloes with V_c_ = 220 km s^-1^, and use the observed properties of our Milky Way system to tune the free parameters that regulate star formation, hydrodynamic feedback from supernovae and the transformation of discs into spheroids by mergers. We then show that the same parameters lead to good agreement between the properties of galaxies in a V_c_ = 1000 km s^-1^ halo and observational data on the Virgo cluster of galaxies. This model correctly reproduces the observed trends in the luminosity, colour, gas content and morphology of galaxies. Turning to an investigation of the properties of the galaxy population as a whole, we highlight a problem that arises when applying this model to a `standard' cold dark matter universe. If the zero-point of the Tully-Fisher relation is set by the properties of our Milky Way system, we find that standard CDM predicts too many haloes and results in a B-band luminosity density of the Universe that is a factor of 2 too high. The only apparent solution to this problem is to assume that many haloes remain observationally undetectable. We also compute the gas mass-luminosity relation for galaxies, the variation in galaxy morphology as a function of luminosity, star formation histories according to environment, the field galaxy luminosity function, and predictions for faint galaxy counts in the B and K bands. We conclude that, although it would be premature to attempt a detailed quantitative fit to specific cosmological models, the qualitative agreement between the data and the general picture that we present is already very encouraging.},

	Abstract = {To compare the chemistries of stars in the Milky Way dwarf spheroidal (dSph) satellite galaxies with stars in the Galaxy, we have compiled a large sample of Galactic stellar abundances from the literature. When kinematic information is available, we have assigned the stars to standard Galactic components through Bayesian classification based on Gaussian velocity ellipsoids. As found in previous studies, the [α/Fe] ratios of most stars in the dSph galaxies are generally lower than similar metallicity Galactic stars in this extended sample. Our kinematically selected stars confirm this for the Galactic halo, thin-disk, and thick-disk components. There is marginal overlap in the low [α/Fe] ratios between dSph stars and Galactic halo stars on extreme retrograde orbits (V<-420 km s-1), but this is not supported by other element ratios. Other element ratios compared in this paper include r- and s-process abundances, where we find a significant offset in the [Y/Fe] ratios, which results in a large overabundance in [Ba/Y] in most dSph stars compared with Galactic stars. Thus, the chemical signatures of most of the dSph stars are distinct from the stars in each of the kinematic components of the Galaxy. This result rules out continuous merging of low-mass galaxies similar to these dSph satellites during the formation of the Galaxy. However, we do not rule out very early merging of low-mass dwarf galaxies, since up to one-half of the most metal-poor stars ([Fe/H]<=-1.8) have chemistries that are in fair agreement with Galactic halo stars. We also do not rule out merging with higher mass galaxies, although we note that the LMC and the remnants of the Sgr dwarf galaxy are also chemically distinct from the majority of the Galactic halo stars. Formation of the Galaxy's thick disk by heating of an old thin disk during a merger is also not ruled out; however, the Galaxy's thick disk itself cannot be comprised of the remnants from a low-mass (dSph) dwarf galaxy, nor of a high-mass dwarf galaxy like the LMC or Sgr, because of differences in chemistry.
The new and independent environments offered by the dSph galaxies also allow us to examine fundamental assumptions related to the nucleosynthesis of the elements. The metal-poor stars ([Fe/H]<=-1.8) in the dSph galaxies appear to have lower [Ca/Fe] and [Ti/Fe] than [Mg/Fe] ratios, unlike similar metallicity stars in the Galaxy. Predictions from the α-process (α-rich freeze-out) would be consistent with this result if there have been a lack of hypernovae in dSph galaxies. The α-process could also be responsible for the very low Y abundances in the metal-poor stars in dSph's; since [La/Eu] (and possibly [Ba/Eu]) are consistent with pure r-process results, the low [Y/Eu] suggests a separate r-process site for this light (first-peak) r-process element. We also discuss SNe II rates and yields as other alternatives, however. In stars with higher metallicities ([Fe/H]>=-1.8), contributions from the s-process are expected; [(Y, La, and Ba)/Eu] all rise as expected, and yet [Ba/Y] is still much higher in the dSph stars than similar metallicity Galactic stars. This result is consistent with s-process contributions from lower metallicity AGB stars in dSph galaxies, and is in good agreement with the slower chemical evolution expected in the low-mass dSph galaxies relative to the Galaxy, such that the build-up of metals occurs over much longer timescales. Future investigations of nucleosynthetic constraints (as well as galaxy formation and evolution) will require an examination of many stars within individual dwarf galaxies.

Finally, the Na-Ni trend reported in 1997 by Nissen & Schuster is confirmed in Galactic halo stars, but we discuss this in terms of the general nucleosynthesis of neutron-rich elements. We do not confirm that the Na-Ni trend is related to the accretion of dSph galaxies in the Galactic halo.},

	Abstract = {We have used the Ultraviolet Visual-Echelle Spectrograph (UVES) on Kueyen (UT2) of the Very Large Telescope to take spectra of 15 individual red giant stars in the centers of four nearby dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSph's): Sculptor, Fornax, Carina, and Leo I. We measure the abundance variations of numerous elements in these low-mass stars with a range of ages (1-15 Gyr old). This means that we can effectively measure the chemical evolution of these galaxies with time. Our results show a significant spread in metallicity with age, but an overall trend consistent with what might be expected from a closed- (or perhaps leaky-) box chemical evolution scenario over the last 10-15 Gyr. We make comparisons between the properties of stars observed in dSph's and in our Galaxy's disk and halo, as well as globular cluster populations in our Galaxy and in the Large Magellanic Cloud. We also look for the signature of the earliest star formation in the universe, which may have occurred in these small systems. We notice that each of these galaxies show broadly similar abundance patterns for all elements measured. This suggests a fairly uniform progression of chemical evolution with time, despite quite a large range of star formation histories. It seems likely that these galaxies had similar initial conditions, and that they evolve in a similar manner with star formation occurring at a uniformly low rate, even if at different times. With our accurate measurements we find evidence for small variations in abundances, which seem to be correlated to variations in star formation histories between different galaxies. The α-element abundances suggest that dSph chemical evolution has not been affected by very high mass stars (>15-20 Msolar). The abundance patterns we measure for stars in dSph's are significantly different from those typically observed in the disk, bulge, and inner halo of our Galaxy. This means that, as far as we can tell from the (limited) data available to date, it is impossible to construct a significant fraction of our disk, inner halo, or bulge from stars formed in dSph's such as we see today, which subsequently merged into our own. Any merger scenario involving dSph's has to occur in the very early universe while they are still gas-rich, so the majority of mass transfer is gas and few stars.

	Abstract = {We present the first data release of the Radial Velocity Experiment (RAVE), an ambitious spectroscopic survey to measure radial velocities and stellar atmosphere parameters (temperature, metallicity, and surface gravity) of up to one million stars using the Six Degree Field multiobject spectrograph on the 1.2 m UK Schmidt Telescope of the Anglo-Australian Observatory. The RAVE program started in 2003, obtaining medium-resolution spectra (median R=7500) in the Ca-triplet region (8410-8795 {\AA}) for southern hemisphere stars drawn from the Tycho-2 and SuperCOSMOS catalogs, in the magnitude range 9<I<12. The first data release is described in this paper and contains radial velocities for 24,748 individual stars (25,274 measurements when including reobservations). Those data were obtained on 67 nights between 2003 April 11 and 2004 April 3. The total sky coverage within this data release is ~4760 deg2. The average signal-to-noise ratio of the observed spectra is 29.5, and 80% of the radial velocities have uncertainties better than 3.4 km s-1. Combining internal errors and zero-point errors, the mode is found to be 2 km s-1. Repeat observations are used to assess the stability of our radial velocity solution, resulting in a variance of 2.8 km s-1. We demonstrate that the radial velocities derived for the first data set do not show any systematic trend with color or signal-to-noise ratio. The RAVE radial velocities are complemented in the data release with proper motions from Starnet 2.0, Tycho-2, and SuperCOSMOS, in addition to photometric data from the major optical and infrared catalogs (Tycho-2, USNO-B, DENIS, and the Two Micron All Sky Survey). The data release can be accessed via the RAVE Web site.},

	Abstract = {Wide-field images obtained with the 3.6 meter Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope are used to investigate the spatial distribution and photometric properties of the brightest stars in the disk of M81 (NGC 3031). With the exception of the central regions of the galaxy and gaps between CCDs, the survey is spatially complete for stars with i' < 24 and major axis distances of 18 kpc. A more modest near-infrared survey detects stars with K < 20 over roughly one third of the disk. Bright main sequence (MS) stars and RSGs are traced out to galactocentric distances of at least 18 kpc. The spatial distribution of bright MS stars tracks emission at far-ultraviolet, mid- and far-infrared wavelengths, although tidal features contain bright MS stars but have little or no infrared flux. The specific frequency of bright MS stars and RSGs, normalized to K-band integrated brightness, increases with radius, indicating that during the past 30 Myr the specific star formation rate (SSFR) has increased with increasing radius. The stellar content of the M81 disk undergoes a distinct change near R ~ 14 kpc, and the luminosity-weighted mean age decreases with increasing radius in the outer regions of the M81 disk.},

	Abstract = {We employ the CFHT Megacam camera to survey ~one deg2 of the southern outer disc of M 31, a region which includes the area where Battinelli et al. (2003, AJ, 125, 1298) have identified nearly one thousand C stars. In the outer M 31 region not previously surveyed, we identify 361 new C star candidates, having similar photometric properties to the known ones, and confirm the slight decrease in the luminosity of C stars with galactocentric distances. We show that the Sloan g', r', i' filters are a viable approach, comparable to (CN - TiO), to identify C stars. We find that the (g' - r') colours of cool C stars can be so red that prohibitively long g' exposures are needed to acquire faint extragalactic C stars. This makes the Sloan filters a less promising approach to extend a C star survey to several Mpc. Our uniform large field survey detects the edge of M 31 disk at ~35 kpc. The intermediate-age population, represented by C stars, extends further to ~40 kpc.},

	Abstract = {In 2007B, we obtained 20 hours of WIRCam, 0.65\arcsec\ IQ,
observing time to image the disk of M31 at J and Ks bands out to the optical
radius ($\sim$23 Ks-mag arcsec$^{-2}$). Although the image quality is superb,
the adopted sky-target nodding sequences, based on conservative expectations,
yielded uncertain sky levels. This proposal is an attempt to salvage
exquisite data with a rapidly monitored sky background, and to extend
CFHT's WIRCam Legacy. The matching of resolved photometry from star counts
(\textit{i.e.}, colour-magnitude diagrams [CMDs]) with the first accurate NIR 
light profile of M31 will establish the first direct correspondence between 
stellar populations and integrated galaxy colours.  The age-metallicity-dust degeneracy that plagues optical-only maps is lifted with NIR images.  CMDs that probe well
into the galaxy disk will enable the first calibration of 
the contentious contribution of high-metallicity AGB stars to the K-band 
light\ --\ a crucial element for stellar population models.  The implications
of this calibration to stellar mass estimates of high-redshift galaxies
cannot be overstated.  Our J and Ks band light profiles and CMDs, when
combined with optical (CFHT MegaCam/PAndAS), infrared (Spitzer IRAC/MIPS), 
and UV (GALEX) imaging will yield an unparalleled characterization of the
dust content, age/metallicity gradients, and stellar mass in M31.},

	Abstract = {Lynden-Bell first demonstrated that the satellites of the Milky Way appear situated along two great 'streams' in the sky: the 'Magellanic stream' and the 'Fornax-Leo-Sculptor (FLS) stream.' Further exploration of the three-dimensional distribution of Galactic satellites reveals that the recently discovered Sextans and Phoenix dwarf spheroidal galaxies also lie near the plane defined by the FLS galaxies, and therefore strengthens the evidence in favor of the FLS stream. Moreover, a specific group of globular clusters -- those exhibiting the reddest horizontal branches (HBs) among those identified as 'young halo' by Zinn -- appear to populate the FLS stream. As previously demonstrated by Zinn, the spatial distribution of old halo globulars appears to be flattened toward the Galactic plane, and therefore the old halo clusters are typically anti-correlated to the nearly orthogonal FLS stream. A scenario is postulated wherein the Galactic satellites of the FLS stream and the red HB, young halo globular clusters share a common origin in the accretion of a formerly larger, parent satellite galaxy or Searle & Zinn 'fragment.'},

	Abstract = {It is now generally believed that galaxies were built up through gravitational amplification of primordial fluctuations and the subsequent merging of smaller precursor structures. The stars of the structures that assembled to form the Milky Way should make up much or all of its bulge and halo, in which case one hopes to find `fossil' evidence for those precursor structures in the present distribution of halo stars. Confirmation that this process is continuing came with the discovery of the Saggittarius dwarf galaxy, which is being disrupted by the Milky Way, but direct evidence that this process provided the bulk of the Milky Way's population of old stars has hitherto been lacking. Here we show that about ten per cent of the metal-poor stars in the halo of the Milky Way, outside the radius of the Sun's orbit, come from a single coherent structure that was disrupted during or soon after the Galaxy's formation. This object had a highly inclined orbit about the Milky Way at a maximum distance of ~16kpc, and it probably resembled the Fornax and Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxies.},

	Abstract = {A new method of analysis yields streams of globular clusters likely to trace the orbits of satellites that may have long since merged with the Galaxy. Besides the streams associated with the Magellanic Clouds and Fornax, new ones associated with the recently discovered remnant in Sagittarius and other possible streams of the outer-halo globular clusters are suggested. Only a few of these suggested streams will be true, but they can be tested because we are able to determine the orbits and predict the proper motions of each cluster. These predicted proper motions which are greater than 1 mas yr^-1 for 22 objects are given in Table 3 and Appendix B.},

There is also some evidence that this continues on the other side of the Magellanic Clouds and crosses the galactic plane at 306 deg galactic longitude. This filament, which follows very closely a great circle over its entire 180 deg arc across the sky, is given the name the Magellanic Stream.},

	Abstract = {The 11 known satellite galaxies within 250 kpc of the Milky Way lie close to a great circle on the sky. We use high-resolution N-body simulations of galactic dark matter haloes to test if this remarkable property can be understood within the context of the cold dark matter (CDM) cosmology. We construct halo merger trees from the simulations and use a semi-analytic model to follow the formation of satellite galaxies. We find that in all six of our simulations, the 11 brightest satellites are indeed distributed along thin, disc-like structures analogous to that traced by the satellites of the Milky Way. This is in sharp contrast to the overall distributions of dark matter in the halo and of subhaloes within it, which, although triaxial, are not highly aspherical. We find that the spatial distribution of satellites is significantly different from that of the most massive subhaloes but is similar to that of the subset of subhaloes that had the most massive progenitors at earlier times. The elongated disc-like structure delineated by the satellites has its long axis aligned with the major axis of the dark matter halo. We interpret our results as reflecting the preferential infall of satellites along the spines of a few filaments of the cosmic web.},

@article{Ibata:1995,
	Abstract = {We have discovered a new Galactic satellite galaxy in the constellation of Sagittarius. The Sagittarius dwarf galaxy subtends an angle of ~10 deg on the sky, lies at a distance of 24 kpc and is comparable in size and luminosity to the largest dwarf spheroidal, Fornax. The new galaxy has many features in common with the other eight Galactic dwarf spheroidal systems, including an extended low-density spatial structure, a well-populated red horizontal branch with a blue extension, and a substantial carbon star population. In terms of stellar populations it most closely resembles the Fornax dwarf, having a strong intermediate-age stellar component and evidence of a metallicity spread. Sagittarius is the nearest galaxy known and currently lies only ~16 kpc from the centre of the Milky Way. Isodensity maps show it to be markedly elongated along a direction pointing towards the Galactic Centre, and suggest that it has been tidally distorted. The close proximity to the Galactic Centre, the morphological appearance and the radial velocity of 140 km s^-1 indicate that this system must have undergone at most very few close orbital encounters with the Milky Way. It is currently undergoing strong tidal disruption prior to being integrated into the Galaxy. We find that at least some of the four globular clusters, M54, Arp 2, Ter 7 and Ter 8, are associated with the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, and will probably share the fate of their progenitor. The Sagittarius dwarf galaxy was found serendipitously using a combination of UK Schmidt Telescope sky survey plates, the APM automatic plate measuring facility and the Anglo-Australian Telescope multifibre spectrograph, AUTOFIB.},

	Abstract = {We have conducted a wide-field CCD-mosaic study of the resolved red giant branch stars of M31, in a field located 20 kpc from the nucleus along the southeast minor axis. In our (I,V-I) color-magnitude diagram, red giant branch (RGB) stars in the top three magnitudes of the M31 halo are strongly present. We use photometry of a more distant control field to subtract field contamination and then to derive the ``cleaned'' luminosity function and metallicity distribution for this outer-halo region of M31. From the color distribution of the foreground Milky Way halo stars, we find a reddening E(V-I)=0.10+/-0.02 for this field, and from the luminosity of the RGB tip we determine a distance modulus (m-M)0=24.47+/-0.12 (=783+/-43 kpc). The metallicity distribution function (MDF) is derived from interpolation within an extensive new grid of RGB models (Vandenberg et al.). We find that the MDF is dominated by a moderately high-metallicity population ([m/H]~-0.5) that has previously been found in more interior M31 halo/bulge fields, and is very much more metal-rich than the [m/H]~-1.5 level which characterizes the Milky Way halo. In addition, a significant (~30%-40%, depending on AGB star contribution) metal-poor population is also present. To first order, the total shape of the MDF resembles that predicted by a simple, single-component model of chemical evolution starting from primordial gas with an effective yield y=0.0055. It strongly resembles the MDF recently found by Harris et al. for the outer halo of the giant elliptical NGC 5128, though NGC 5128 has an even lower fraction of low-metallicity stars. Intriguingly, in both NGC 5128 and M31, the metallicity distribution of the globular clusters in M31 does not match the halo stars, in the sense that the clusters are far more heavily weighted to metal-poor objects. We suggest similarities in the formation and early evolution of massive, spheroidal stellar systems.},

	Abstract = {We present the results of a wide-field (VI) photometric study of the red giant branch (RGB) stars in the outer halo of M31, in a field located 30-35 kpc from the center of the galaxy along the southeast minor axis. At this remote location, we find that RGB stars belonging to M31 are sparsely but definitely present, after statistical subtraction of field contamination. We derive the metallicity distribution function (MDF) for the halo stars using interpolation within a standard (I, V-I) grid of RGB evolutionary tracks. The halo MDF is quite broad but dominated by a moderately high-metallicity population peaking at [M/H]~-0.5, strikingly different from the [M/H]~-1.3 level that characterizes the outer halo of the Milky Way. However, the shape and peak metallicity for this region are entirely similar to those found in other studies for the inner regions of the M31 halo, particularly our previous study of a 20 kpc region employing similar data. In summary, we find no evidence for a metallicity gradient or systematic change in the MDF out to quite large distances in the M31 halo: it appears to be a homogeneous and moderately metal-rich subsystem of the galaxy at all locations. The star counts in the 30 kpc field are also consistent with the r1/4 law that fits the interior regions of the M31 spheroid surface brightness profile. The metal-rich MDF and the r1/4 spheroid suggests M31 more strongly resembles a giant elliptical galaxy than other, Milky Way-like, spirals.},

	Abstract = {At redshifts around 0.1 the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey Deep fields contain some 6 x 104 galaxies spanning the mass range from 105 to 1012 M . We measure the stellar mass dependence of the two-point correlation using angular measurements to largely bypass the errors, approximately 0.02 in the median, of the photometric redshifts. Inverting the power-law fits with Limber's equation we find that the autocorrelation length increases from a very low 0.4 h -1 Mpc at 105.5 M to the conventional 4.5 h -1 Mpc at 1010.5 M . The power-law fit to the correlation function has a slope which increases from g [?] 1.6 at high mass to g [?] 2.3 at low mass. The spatial cross-correlation of dwarf galaxies with more massive galaxies shows fairly similar trends, with a steeper radial dependence at low mass than predicted in numerical simulations of subhalos within galaxy halos. To examine the issue of "missing satellites" we combine the cross-correlation measurements with our estimates of the low-mass galaxy number density. We find on the average there are 60 +- 20 dwarfs in subhalos with M(total)$>$107 M for a typical Local Group M(total)/M(stars) = 30, corresponding to M/LV [?] 100 for a galaxy with no recent star formation. The number of dwarfs per galaxy is about a factor of 2 larger than currently found for the Milky Way. Nevertheless, the average dwarf counts are about a factor of 30 below lambda cold dark matter (LCDM) simulation results. The divergence from LCDM predictions is one of the slope of the relation, approximately dN/dln M [?] -0.5 rather than the predicted -0.9, not sudden onset at some characteristic scale. The dwarf galaxy star formation rates span the range from passive to bursting, which suggests that there are few completely dark halos.},

	Abstract = {We describe a search for Hα emission-line stars in M31, M33, and seven dwarfs in or near the Local Group (IC 10, NGC 6822, WLM, Sextans B, Sextans A, Pegasus, and the Phoenix dwarf) using interference filter imaging with the KPNO and CTIO 4 m telescopes and Mosaic cameras. The survey is aimed primarily at identifying new luminous blue variables (LBVs) from their spectroscopic similarity to known LBVs, avoiding the bias toward photometric variability, which may require centuries to manifest itself if LBVs go through long quiescent periods. Follow-up spectroscopy with WIYN confirms that our survey detected a wealth of stars whose spectra are similar to the known LBVs. We "classify" the spectra of known LBVs and compare these to the spectra of the new LBV candidates. We demonstrate spectacular spectral variability for several of the new LBV candidates, such as AM2, previously classified as a Wolf-Rayet star (WR), which now shows Fe I, Fe II, and Balmer emission lines but neither the N III λλ4634, 4642 nor the He II λ4686 emission it did in 1982. Profound spectral changes are also noted for other suspected and known LBVs. Several of the LBV candidates also show >0.5 mag changes in V over the past 10-20 years. The number of known or suspected LBVs is now 24 in M31, 37 in M33, 1 in NGC 6822, and 3 in IC 10. We estimate that the total number of LBVs in M31 and M33 may be several hundred, in contrast to the eight known historically through large-scale photometric variability. This has significant implications for the timescale of the LBV phase. We also identify a few new WRs and peculiar emission-line objects.
Observations reported here were obtained at the MMT Observatory, a joint facility of the Smithsonian Institution and the University of Arizona.},

We construct color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of these systems, as well as neighboring regions that can be used to evaluate the degree of foreground contamination by stars in the Milky Way. Intercomparison of these CMDs with those of M31, M33, the LMC, and the SMC permits us to determine improved reddening values for a typical OB star found within these galaxies. All of the CMDs reveal a strong or modest number of blue supergiants. All but Pegasus and Phoenix also show the clear presence of red supergiants in the CMD, although IC 10 appears to be deficient in these objects given its large Wolf-Rayet star population. The bright stars of intermediate color in the CMD are badly contaminated by foreground stars (30%-100%), and considerable spectroscopy is needed before statistics on the yellow supergiants in these systems will be known. This study is intended to serve as both the impetus and ``finding charts'' for further space-based imaging and for many spectroscopic programs at large aperture.},

	Abstract = {We present UBVRI photometry obtained from Mosaic images of M31 and M33 using the Kitt Peak National Observatory 4 m telescope. We describe our data reduction and automated photometry techniques in some detail, as we will shortly perform a similar analysis of other Local Group galaxies. The present study covered 2.2 deg2 along the major axis of M31 and 0.8 deg2 on M33, chosen so as to include all of the regions currently active in forming massive stars. We calibrated our data using photometry from the Lowell 1.1 m telescope, and this external method resulted in millimagnitude differences in the photometry of overlapping fields, providing some assurance that our photometry is reliable. The final catalog contains 371,781 and 146,622 stars in M31 and M33, respectively, where every star has a counterpart in (at least) the B, V, and R passbands. Our survey goes deep enough to achieve 1%-2% photometry at 21 mag (corresponding to stars more massive than 20 Msolar) and achieves <10% errors at U~B~V~R~I~23 mag. Although our typical seeing was only modest (0.8"-1.4", with median 1.0") by some standards, we find excellent correspondence between our catalog sources and those we see in our Hubble Space Telescope ACS data for OB48, a crowded region in M31. We compare our final photometry with that of others and find good agreement with the CCD catalog of M31 stars by Magnier et al., although our study covers twice the area and goes about 2 mag deeper. There is also excellent agreement with the CCD ``DIRECT'' surveys of M31 and M33. The photographic studies of others fare less well, particularly at the faint end in V, where accurate background subtraction is needed for good photometry. We provide cross-references to the stars confirmed as members by spectroscopy and compare the locations of these to the complete set in color-magnitude diagrams. While follow-up spectroscopy is needed for many projects, we demonstrate the success of our photometry in being able to distinguish M31/M33 members from foreground Galactic stars. Finally, we present the results of a single night of spectroscopy on the WIYN 3.5 m telescope, examining the brightest likely members of M31. The spectra identify 34 newly confirmed members, including B-A supergiants, the earliest O star known in M31, and two new luminous blue variable candidates whose spectra are similar to that of P Cygni.

	Abstract = {At the heart of a successful theory of galaxy formation must be a detailed physical understanding of the dissipational processes which form spiral galaxies. To what extent can we unravel the events that produced the Galaxy as we see it today? Could some of the residual inhomogeneities from prehistory have escaped the dissipative process at an early stage? To make a comprehensive inventory of surviving inhomogeneities would require a vast catalog of stellar properties that is presently out of reach. The Gaia space astrometry mission, set to launch at the end of the decade, will acquire detailed phase space coordinates for about one billion stars, within a sphere of diameter 20 kpc -- the Gaiasphere. Here we look forward to a time when all stars within the Gaiasphere have complete chemical abundance measurements (including alpha, s and r process elements). Even with such a vast increase in information, there may exist fundamental -- but unproven -- limits to unravelling the observed complexity.},

@article{Kotoneva:2002,
	Abstract = {K dwarfs have lifetimes older than the present age of the Galactic disc, and are thus ideal stars for investigating the chemical evolution of the disc. We have developed several photometric metallicity indicators for K dwarfs, based on a sample of accurate spectroscopic metallicities for 34 disc and halo G and K dwarfs. The photometric metallicities lead us to develop a metallicity index for K dwarfs based only on their position in the colour-absolute-magnitude diagram. Metallicities have been determined for 431 single K dwarfs drawn from the Hipparcos catalogue, selecting the stars by absolute magnitude and removing multiple systems. The sample is essentially a complete reckoning of the metal content in nearby K dwarfs. We use stellar isochrones to mark the stars by mass, and select a subset of 220 of the stars, which is complete within a narrow mass interval. We fit the data with a model of the chemical evolution of the solar cylinder. We find that only a modest cosmic scatter is required to fit our age-metallicity relation. The model assumes two main infall episodes for the formation of the halo-thick disc and thin disc, respectively. The new data confirm that the solar neighbourhood formed on a long time-scale of the order of 7 Gyr.},

	Abstract = {The evidence that gas exists in the halo of the Galaxy is examined. The likely properties of halo gas intervening between QSOs and the Galaxy are extracted from observations of the galactic halo. The available data discussed include 21-cm observations, optical absorption lines, ultraviolet lines, and X-ray observations. The possible existence of a cosmic ray halo is assessed, and the relationship of galactic size to the extent of the halo is examined. The main physical constraints on the gas in the halo are detailed, including the radiation field, particle density, temperature, mass in the halo gas, and abundances. Models for the gas in the halo are summarized. It appears that the distribution of gas in the galactic halo is an expanded disk not more than 10 kpc thick. At low column densities, the Galaxy could extend out to several times the Holmberg radius. The disk may be photoionized on the outside by the QSO background radiation.},

	Abstract = {The Draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph), with its apparent immense mass-to-light ratio and compact size, holds many clues to the nature of the enigmatic dark matter. Here we present deep photometric studies of this dwarf galaxy, undertaken with the MegaCam Camera at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, the Wide Field Camera at the Isaac Newton Telescope and the Wide Field and Planetary Camera onboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The new photometric data cover the entirety of the galaxy, and reach i' = 24.5 at 50 per cent completeness, significantly deeper than previous panoramic studies, allowing searches for tidal disturbances of much lower surface brightness than has been possible before. With these improved statistics, we find no evidence for asymmetric disturbances or tidal tails that possess more than 3 per cent of the stars found within the centre of the galaxy. We find that the central stellar density, as probed by the HST data, rises into the central 0.5 arcmin. Uncertainties in the position of the centroid of the galaxy do not allow us to determine whether the apparent flattening of the profile interior to 0.5 arcmin is reliable or not. Draco is therefore a flawless dwarf galaxy, featureless and apparently unaffected by Galactic tides.

	Abstract = {Aims.We present the first results of a large spectroscopic survey of candidate globular clusters located in the extreme outskirts of the nearby M 31 galaxy. The survey is aimed at ascertaining the nature of the selected candidates to increase the sample of confirmed M 31 clusters lying more that 2$\,^{\circ}$ away from the center of the galaxy. Methods: We obtained low resolution spectra (λ/Δλ ≃ 800-1300) of 48 targets selected from the Extended Source Catalogue of 2MASS, as in Galleti et al. (2005, A&A, 436, 535). The observed candidates have been robustly classified according to their radial velocity and by verifying their extended/point-source nature from ground-based optical images. We have also obtained a spectrum and a radial velocity estimate for the remote M 31 globular discovered by Martin et al. (2006b, MNRAS, 371, 1983). Results: Among the 48 observed candidates clusters we found: 35 background galaxies, 8 foreground Galactic stars, and 5 genuine remote globular clusters. One of them has been already identified independently by Mackey et al. (2007, ApJ, 655, L85), their GC1; the other four are completely new discoveries: B516, B517, B518, B519. The newly discovered clusters lie at projected distance 40 kpc ≲ R_p≲ 100 kpc from the center of M 31, and have absolute integrated magnitude -9.5 ≲ MV ≲ -7.5. For all the observed clusters we have measured the strongest Lick indices and we have obtained spectroscopic metallicity estimates. Mackey-GC1, Martin-GC1, B517 and B518 have spectra typical of old and metal poor globular clusters ([Fe/H] ≲ -1.3); B519 appears old but quite metal-rich ([Fe/H]~≃ -0.5); B516 presents very strong Balmer absorption lines: if this is indeed a cluster it should have a relatively young age (likely < 2 Gyr). Conclusions: The present analysis nearly doubles the number of M 31 globulars at R_p≥ 40 kpc. At odds with the Milky Way, M 31 appears to have a significant population of very bright globular clusters in its extreme outskirts.

@article{Federici:2007,
	Abstract = {Aims.We present a study of the density profile of the remote M 31 globular cluster B514, obtained from HST/ACS observations. Methods: By coupling analysis of the distribution of the integrated light with star counts, we are able to reliably follow the profile of the cluster out to r ~ 35 arcsec, corresponding to ≃130 pc. The profile is well-fitted out to ~15 core radii by a King Model having C = 1.65. With an estimated core radius rc = 0.38 arcsec, this corresponds to a tidal radius of r_t~ 17 arcsec (~65 pc). The analysis of the light profile also allows an estimate of the ellipticity and position angle of the isophotes within r ≤ 20 arcsec. Results: We find that both the light and the star-count profiles show a departure from the best-fit King model for r ⪆ 8 arcsec - as a surface brightness excess at large radii, and the star-count profile shows a clear break in the correspondence of the estimated tidal radius. Both features are interpreted as the signature of the presence of extra tidal stars around the cluster. It is also shown that B514 has a significantly larger half-light radius than ordinary globular clusters of the same luminosity. In the MV vs. log rh plane, B514 lies in a region inhabited by peculiar clusters, like ω Cen, G1, NGC 2419 and others, as well as by the nuclei of dwarf elliptical galaxies.

Paper I reported results from images obtained with the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) and this paper reports results from the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS). The ACS survey has yielded a total of 339 star clusters, 52 of which-mostly globular clusters-were found to have been cataloged previously. As for the previous survey, the luminosity function of the clusters drops steeply for absolute magnitudes fainter than V-I=0.50, where there are intermediate-age, intermediate-mass clusters with ages close to 500 million years and masses of about 2000 solar masses. We give a brief qualitative interpretation of the distribution of clusters in the CMDs in terms of their formation and destruction rates.},

	Abstract = {As a follow-up to the automated cluster search carried out by Williams & Hodge, we have examined 39 Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) pointings to locate and study a comprehensive collection of disk clusters. The Williams technique was effective in finding young clusters, but not intermediate-age or old clusters. Our searches have shown that M31 has large numbers of these intermediate and older open clusters, most of them undetected by both the Williams survey and other ground-based searches. We present a catalog of 343 clusters detected on the WFPC2 images. Extrapolation from our data indicates that the entire disk of M31 contains approximately 80,000 star clusters. We have carried out integrated multicolor photometry of these clusters to ascertain their properties and to compare their properties with cluster systems of other galaxies. We show the cluster luminosity function, the color-magnitude diagram, the formation function, and the size distribution. Cluster densities and colors show trends with disk position. An age distribution is derived and, although the ages are very uncertain for the fainter clusters, there is evidence for cluster dynamical destruction at about the same rate as in our Galaxy.

	Abstract = {We have measured the amount of kinematic substructure in the Galactic halo using the final dataset from the Spaghetti project, a pencil-beam high latitude sky survey. Our sample contains 101 photometrically selected and spectroscopically confirmed giants with accurate distance, radial velocity and metallicity information. We have developed a new clustering estimator: the "4distance" measure, which when applied to our dataset leads to the identification of 1 group and 7 pairs of clumped stars. The group, with 6 members, can confidently be matched to tidal debris of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. Two pairs match the properties of known Virgo structures. Using models of the disruption of Sagittarius in Galactic potentials with different degrees of dark halo flattening, we show that this favors a spherical or prolate halo shape, as demonstrated by Newberg et al. (2007) using SDSS data. One additional pair can be linked to older Sagittarius debris. We find that 20% of the stars in the Spaghetti dataset are in substructures. From comparison with random datasets we derive a very conservative lower limit of 10% to the amount of substructure in the halo. However, comparison to numerical simulations shows that our results are also consistent with a halo entirely built up from disrupted satellites, provided the dominating features are relatively broad due to early merging or relatively heavy progenitor satellites.},

	Abstract = {We study numerical simulations of satellite galaxy disruption in a potential resembling that of the Milky Way. Our goal is to assess whether a merger origin for the stellar halo would leave observable fossil structure in the phase-space distribution of nearby stars. We show how mixing of disrupted satellites can be quantified using a coarse-grained entropy. Although after 10Gyr few obvious asymmetries remain in the distribution of particles in configuration space, strong correlations are still present in velocity space. We give a simple analytic description of these effects, based on a linearized treatment in action-angle variables, which shows how the kinematic and density structure of the debris stream changes with time. By applying this description we find that a single dwarf elliptical-like satellite of current luminosity 10^8L_solar disrupted 10Gyr ago from an orbit circulating in the inner halo (mean apocentre ~12kpc) would contribute about ~30 kinematically cold streams with internal velocity dispersions below 5kms^-1 to the local stellar halo. If the whole stellar halo were built by such disrupted satellites, it should consist locally of 300-500 such streams. Clear detection of all these structures would require a sample of a few thousand stars with 3D velocities accurate to better than 5kms^-1. Even with velocity errors several times worse than this, the expected clumpiness should be quite evident. We apply our formalism to a group of stars detected near the North Galactic Pole, and derive an order-of-magnitude estimate for the initial properties of the progenitor system.},

	Abstract = {A method of abundance determination based on reddening-independent properties of low-resolution spectral scans is described and applied to 177 red giants in 19 globular clusters, most of which are at galactocentric distances in excess of 8 kpc. The general properties of the halo-cluster system inferred from the abundance results are examined. It is found that the distribution over abundance of the halo globular clusters is independent of galactocentric distance for distances exceeding 8 kpc and that the clusters exhibit differences in the morphology of their color-magnitude diagrams that are uncorrelated with metal abundance. The characteristics of the system of halo clusters are compared with implications of some simple conceptual schemes for the formation of the Galaxy. It is suggested that the halo clusters originated within transient protogalactic fragments that gradually lost gas while undergoing chemical evolution and continued to fall into the Galaxy after the collapse of its central regions had been completed.},

@article{Yang:2009,
	Abstract = {In the standard paradigm, satellite galaxies are believed to be associated with the population of dark matter subhalos. The assumption usually made is that the relationship between satellite galaxies and subhalos is similar to that between central galaxies and host halos. In this paper, we use the conditional stellar mass functions of satellite galaxies obtained from a large galaxy group catalog together with models of the subhalo mass functions to explore the consequences of such assumption in connection to the stellar mass function of satellite galaxies and the fraction and fate of stripped stars from satellites in galaxy groups and clusters of different masses. The majority of the stripped stars in massive halos are predicted to end up as intracluster stars, and the predicted amounts of the intracluster component as a function of the velocity dispersion of galaxy system match well the observational results obtained by Gonzalez et al. (2007). The fraction of the mass in the stripped stars to that remain bound in the central and satellite galaxies is the highest (~40% of the total stellar mass) in halos with masses Mh ~ 1014 h --1 M sun. If all these stars end up in the intracluster component (Max), or a maximum amount of these stars is accreted into the central galaxy (Min), then the maximum fraction of the total stars in the whole universe that is in the diffused intracluster component is ~19%, and the minimum is ~5%. In the case of "Max," the stellar mass of the intracluster component in massive halos with Mh ~ 1015 h --1 M sun is roughly six times as large as that of the central galaxy. This factor decreases to ~2, 1, and 0.1 in halos with Mh ~ 1014, 1013, and 1012 h --1 M sun, respectively. The total amount of stars stripped from satellite galaxies is insufficient to build up the central galaxies in halos with masses lsim1012.5 h --1 M sun, and so the quenching of star formation must occur in halos with higher masses. In semianalytical models and simulations that do not resolve the diffused component, caution must be exercised when using the observed stellar mass/luminosity function of galaxies to constrain the star formation, feedback and merger processes in dark matter halos.},

	Abstract = {We present a V-I color-magnitude diagram for a region 1' - 2' from the center of M32 based on Hubble Space Telescope WFPC2 images. The broad color-luminosity distribution of red giants shows that the stellar population comprises stars with a wide range in metallicity. This distribution cannot be explained by a spread in age. The blue side of the giant branch rises to M_I_ ~ -4.0 and can be fitted with isochrones having [Fe/H] ~ - 1.5. The red side consists of a heavily populated and dominant sequence that tops out at M_I_~ -3.2, and extends beyond V-I=4. This sequence can be fitted with isochrones with -0.2 < [Fe/H] <+0.1, for ages running from 15 Gyr to 5 Gyr, respectively. We do not find the optically bright asymptotic giant branch stars seen in previous ground- based work and argue that the majority of them were artifacts of crowding. Our results are consistent with the presence of the infrared- luminous giants found in ground-based studies, though their existence cannot be directly confirmed by our data. The tip of the metal-poor portion of the giant branch occurs at the luminosity expected if M32 is at the same distance as M31 but is too sparsely sampled by this data set to provide a precise distance estimate. At fainter magnitudes, the rising giant branch is significantly wider (FWHM_V-I_ ~0.6 mag down to M_I_ ~ - 1.0) than can be accounted for by photometric uncertainties, again due to a metallicity spread. There is little evidence for an extended or even a red horizontal branch, but we find a strong clump on the giant branch itself, as expected for the high metallicities inferred from the giant branch. If the age spread is not extreme, the distribution of metallicities in M32 is considerably narrower than that of the closed-box model of chemical evolution, and also appears somewhat narrower than that of the solar neighborhood. Overall, the M32 HST color-magnitude diagram is consistent with the average luminosity-weighted age of 8.5 Gyr and [Fe/H] ~-0.25 inferred from integrated spectral indices, extrapolated to the same radius and analyzed with the same population models.},

@article{Majewski:2003,
	Abstract = {We present the first all-sky view of the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf galaxy mapped by M-giant star tracers detected in the complete Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS). Near-infrared photometry of Sgr's prominent M-giant population permits an unprecedentedly clear view of the center of Sgr. The main body is fitted with a King profile of limiting major-axis radius 30$\,^{\circ}$-substantially larger than previously found or assumed-beyond which is a prominent break in the density profile from stars in the Sgr tidal tails; thus the Sgr radial profile resembles that of Galactic dwarf speroidal (dSph) satellites. Adopting traditional methods for analyzing dSph light profiles, we determine the brightness of the main body of Sgr to be MV=-13.27 (the brightest of the known Galactic dSph galaxies) and the total Sgr mass-to-light ratio to be 25 in solar units. However, we regard the latter result with suspicion and argue that much of the observed structure beyond the King-fit core radius (224') may be outside the actual Sgr tidal radius as the former dwarf spiral/irregular satellite undergoes catastrophic disruption during its last orbits. The M-giant distribution of Sgr exhibits a central density cusp at the same location as, but not due to, the old stars constituting the globular cluster M54. A striking trailing tidal tail is found to extend from the Sgr center and arc across the south Galactic hemisphere with approximately constant density and mean distance varying from ~20 to 40 kpc. A prominent leading debris arm extends from the Sgr center northward of the Galactic plane to an apogalacticon ~45 kpc from the Sun and then turns toward the north Galactic cap (NGC), from where it descends back toward the Galactic plane, becomes foreshortened, and, at brighter magnitudes, covers the NGC. The leading and trailing Sgr tails lie along a well-defined orbital plane about the Galactic center. The Sun lies within a kiloparsec of that plane and near the path of leading Sgr debris; thus, it is possible that former Sgr stars are near or in the solar neighborhood. We discuss the implications of this new view of the Sgr galaxy and its entrails for the character of the Sgr orbit, mass, mass-loss rate, and contribution of stars to the Milky Way halo. The minimal precession displayed by the Sgr tidal debris along its inclined orbit supports the notion of a nearly spherical Galactic potential. The number of M giants in the Sgr tails is at least 15% that contained within the King limiting radius of the main Sgr body. The fact that M giants, presumably formed within the past few gigayears in the Sgr nucleus, are nevertheless so widespread along the Sgr tidal arms not only places limits on the dynamical age of these arms but also poses a timing problem that bears on the recent binding energy of the Sgr core and that is most naturally explained by recent and catastrophic mass loss. Sgr appears to contribute more than 75% of the high-latitude, halo M giants, despite substantial reservoirs of M giants in the Magellanic Clouds. No evidence of extended M-giant tidal debris from the Magellanic Clouds is found. Generally good correspondence is found between the M-giant, all-sky map of the Sgr system and all previously published detections of potential Sgr debris, with the exception of Sgr carbon stars, which must be subluminous compared with counterparts in other Galactic satellites in order to resolve the discrepancy.},

	Abstract = {Mid-infrared observations of the Andromeda galaxy, M31, obtained with the Infrared Array Camera on board the Spitzer Space Telescope are presented. The image mosaics cover areas of approximately 3.7d×1.6d and include the satellite galaxies M32 and NGC 205. The appearance of M31 varies dramatically in the different mid-infrared bands, from the smooth bulge and disk of the old stellar population seen at 3.6 μm to the well-known ``10 kpc ring'' dominating the 8 μm image. The similarity of the 3.6 μm and optical isophotes and the nearly constant optical-mid-infrared color over the inner 400" confirm that there is no significant extinction at optical wavelengths in M31's bulge. The nuclear colors indicate the presence of dust but not an infrared-bright active galactic nucleus. The integrated 8 μm nonstellar luminosity implies a star formation rate of 0.4 Msolar yr-1, consistent with other indicators that show M31 to be a quiescent galaxy.

Erratum:
An incorrect value of the K-band mass-to-light ratio, M/LK, was used to compute the stellar mass of M31. Using the correct value of 0.80 derived from the fits in Table 1 of Bell & de Jong (2001), and assuming K-[3.6]=0.3, the stellar mass implied by the extrapolated total magnitude ([3.6]=-0.34) is 1.1×1011 Msolar. We thank F. Hammer for alerting us to this error.},

	Abstract = {We present Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopy of Segue 1, an ultra-low-luminosity (MV = -1.5+0.6 -0.8) Milky Way satellite companion. While the combined size and luminosity of Segue 1 are consistent with either a globular cluster or a dwarf galaxy, we present spectroscopic evidence that this object is a dark matter-dominated dwarf galaxy. We identify 24 stars as members of Segue 1 with a mean heliocentric recession velocity of 206 +- 1.3 km s-1. Although Segue 1 spatially overlaps the leading arm of the Sagittarius stream, its velocity is 100 km s-1 different from that predicted for recent Sagittarius tidal debris at this position. We measure an internal velocity dispersion of 4.3 +- 1.2 km s-1. Under the assumption that these stars are gravitationally bound and in dynamical equilibrium, we infer a total mass of 4.5+4.7 -2.5 x 105 M in the mass-follow-light case; using a two-component maximum-likelihood model, we determine a mass within 50 pc of 8.7+13 -5.2 x 105 M . These imply mass-to-light (M/L) ratios of ln(M/L V ) = 7.2+1.1 -1.2 (M/L V = 1320+2680 -940) and M/L V = 2440+1580 -1775, respectively. The error distribution of the M/L is nearly lognormal, thus Segue 1 is dark matter-dominated at a high significance. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that Segue 1 has been tidally disrupted, we do not find kinematic evidence supporting tidal effects. Using spectral synthesis modeling, we derive a metallicity for the single red giant branch star in our sample of [Fe/H] = -3.3 +- 0.2 dex. Finally, we discuss the prospects for detecting gamma rays from annihilation of dark matter particles and show that Segue 1 is the most promising satellite for indirect dark matter detection. We conclude that Segue 1 is the least luminous of the ultra-faint galaxies recently discovered around the Milky Way, and is thus the least-luminous known galaxy.},

	Abstract = {We have conducted a deep, complete H I survey, using Arecibo/Arecibo L-band Feed Array (ALFA), of a field centered on the nearby, isolated galaxy, NGC 2903, which is similar to the Milky Way in its properties. The field size was 150 kpc x 260 kpc and the final velocity range spanned from 100 to 1133 km s-1. The ALFA beams have been mapped as a function of azimuth and cleaned from each azimuth-specific cube prior to forming final cubes. The final H I data are sensitive down to an H I mass of 2 x 105 M and column density of 2 x 1017 cm-2 at the 3 s 2 d V level, where s is the rms noise level and d V is the velocity resolution. NGC 2903 is found to have an H I envelope that is larger than previously known, extending to at least three times the optical diameter of the galaxy. Our search for companions yields one new discovery with an H I mass of 2.6 x 106 M . The companion is 64 kpc from NGC 2903 in projection, is likely associated with a small optical galaxy of similar total stellar mass, and is dark matter dominated, with a total mass $>$108 M . In the region surveyed, there are now two known companions: our new discovery and a previously known system that is likely a dwarf spheroidal, lacking H I content. If H I constitutes 1\% of the total mass in all possible companions, then we should have detected 230 companions, according to L cold dark matter (LCDM) predictions. Consequently, if this number of dark-matter clumps are indeed present, then they contain less than 1\% H I content, possibly existing as very faint dwarf spheroidals or as starless, gasless dark-matter clumps.},

@article{von-Hippel:2002,
	Abstract = {We present deep BVI observations of the core of M35 and a nearby comparison field obtained at the WIYN 3.5 m telescope under excellent seeing conditions. These observations probe to V>26 and display the lower main sequence in BV and VI CMDs down to V=23.3 and 24.6, respectively. At these faint magnitudes the background Galactic field stars are far more numerous than the cluster stars, yet by using a smoothing technique and CMD density distribution subtraction we are able to recover the cluster fiducial main sequence and luminosity function to V=24.6. We find the location of the M35 main sequence in these CMDs to be consistent with earlier work on other open clusters, specifically NGC 188, 2420, and 2477. We compare these open cluster fiducial sequences with stellar models by Baraffe et al., Siess et al., Girardi et al., and Yi et al. and find that the models are too blue in both B-V and V-I for stars less massive than ~0.4 Msolar. At least part of the problem appears to be underestimated opacity in the bluer bandpasses, with the amount of missing opacity increasing toward the blue. M35 contains stars to the limit of the extracted main sequence, at M~0.10-0.15 Msolar, suggesting that M35 may harbor a large number of brown dwarfs, which should be easy targets for sensitive near-IR instrumentation on 8-10 m telescopes. We also identify a new candidate white dwarf (WD) in M35 at V=21.36+/-0.01. Depending on which WD models are used in interpreting this cluster candidate, it is either a very high mass WD (1.05+/-0.05 Msolar), somewhat older (0.19-0.26 Gyr, 3-4 σ) than our best isochrone age (150 Myr), or it is a modestly massive WD (0.67-0.78 Msolar) that is much too old (0.42-0.83 Gyr) to belong to the cluster. Follow-up spectroscopy is required to resolve this issue. The WIYN Observatory is a joint facility of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Indiana University, Yale University, and the National Optical Astronomy Observatory.},

@article{Kalirai:2003,
	Abstract = {We continue our study of rich Galactic clusters by presenting deep CCD observations of both NGC 2168 (M35) and NGC 2323 (M50). Both clusters are found to be rich (NGC 2168 contains at least 1000 stars brighter than V=22, and NGC 2323 contains ~2100 stars brighter than our photometric limit of V~23) and young (NGC 2168 age=180 Myr and for NGC 2323 age=130 Myr). The color-magnitude diagrams for the clusters exhibit clear main sequences stretching over 14 mag in the (V, B-V)-plane. Comparing these long main sequences with those of earlier clusters in the survey, as well as with the Hyades, has allowed for accurate distances to be established for each cluster (for NGC 2168 d=912+70-65 pc and for NGC 2323 d=1000+81-75 pc). Analysis of the luminosity and mass functions suggests that, despite their young ages, both clusters are somewhat dynamically relaxed, exhibiting signs of mass segregation. This is especially interesting in the case of NGC 2323, which has an age of only 1.3 times the dynamical relaxation time. The present photometry is also deep enough to detect all of the white dwarfs in both clusters. We discuss some interesting candidates that may be the remnants of quite massive (M>=5Msolar) progenitor stars. The white dwarf cooling age of NGC 2168 is found to be in good agreement with the main-sequence turnoff age. These objects are potentially very important for setting constraints on the white dwarf initial-final mass relationship and the upper mass limit for white dwarf production.},

Over the range 0.2 approximately less than R(kpc) approximately less than 20 the surface brightness distribution in the halo of the Andromeda galaxy is well-represented by a single de Vaucouleurs law. Alternatively, the outer halo of M31 can also be modelled by a power-law density distribution of the form rho (R) varies as R-5. This result suggests that the globular cluster component of the halo of M31 (for which rho varies as R-3) is more extended than the stellar halo of this galaxy. At muV approximately equals 28 mag arcsec-2 (R approximately equals 10 kpc), the axial ratio of the halo of M31 is found to be b/a = 0.55 +/- 0.05.},

@article{Martin:2006,
	Abstract = {We present the discovery of three faint dwarf galaxies and a globular cluster in the halo of the Andromeda galaxy (M31), found in our MegaCam survey that spans the southern quadrant of M31, from a projected distance of ~50 to ~150kpc. Though the survey covers 57 deg2, the four satellites lie within 2$\,^{\circ}$ of one another. From the tip of the red giant branch (RGB), we estimate that the globular cluster lies at a distance of 631 +/- 58kpc from the Milky Way and along with a ~100kpc projected distance from M31 we derive a total distance of 175 +/- 55kpc from its host, making it the farthest M31 globular cluster known. It also shows the typical characteristics of a bright globular cluster, with a half-light radius of 2.3 +/- 0.2pc and an absolute magnitude in the V band of MV,0 = -8.5 +/- 0.3. Isochrone fitting reveals that it is dominated by a very old population with a metallicity of [Fe/H] ~ -1.3. The three dwarf galaxies are revealed as overdensities of stars that are aligned along the RGB tracks in their colour-magnitude diagrams. These satellites are all very faint, with absolute magnitudes in the range -7.3 <~ MV,0 <~ -6.4, and show strikingly similar characteristics with metallicities of [Fe/H] ~ -1.4 and half-light radii of ~120 +/- 45pc, making these dwarf galaxies two to three times smaller than the smallest previously known satellites of M31. Given their faintness, their distance is difficult to constrain, but we estimate them to be between 740 and 955kpc which places them well within the virial radius of the host galaxy. The panoramic view of the MegaCam survey can provide an unbiased view of the satellite distribution of the Andromeda galaxy and, extrapolating from its coverage of the halo, we estimate that up to 45 +/- 20 satellites brighter than MV ~ -6.5 should be orbiting M31. Hence faint dwarf galaxies cannot alone account for the missing satellites that are predicted by Λ cold dark matter models, unless they reside in dark matter minihaloes that are more massive than the typical masses of 107Msolar currently inferred from their central radial velocity dispersion.
Based on observations obtained with MegaPrime/MegaCam, a joint project of CFHT and CEA/DAPNIA, at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) which is operated by the National Research Council (NRC) of Canada, the Institut National des Science de l'Univers of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) of France and the University of Hawaii.

	Abstract = {Understanding galaxy formation involves look-back and fossil-record studies of distant and nearby galaxies, respectively. Debris trails in our Galaxy's spheroidal halo of old stars provide evidence of "bottom-up" formation via tidal disruption/merging of dwarf satellite galaxies, but it is difficult to study our Galaxy's large-scale structure from within. Studies of our neighbouring Andromeda galaxy have concluded that its spheroid contains chemically enriched ("metal-rich") stars out to a radius of 30 kiloparsecs with an exponential r^1/4 fall-off in density thereby resembling a galactic "bulge". Were Andromeda's true halo to be found, our detailed yet global view of its stellar dynamics, substructure, chemical abundance, and age distribution would directly constrain hierarchical halo formation models. We report here on the discovery of a hitherto elusive halo of metal-poor Andromeda stars, distinct from its bulge, with a power-law brightness profile extending beyond r = 160 kiloparsecs. This is 3 - 5 times larger than any previously mapped Andromeda spheroidal/disk component. Together, the Galactic and Andromeda halos span >1/3 of the distance between them, suggesting that stars occupy a substantial volume fraction of our Local Group, and possibly most galaxy groups.},

	Abstract = {We construct test-particle orbits and simple N-body models that match the properties of the giant stellar stream observed to the south of M31, using the model of M31's potential derived in the companion paper by Geehan et al. We introduce a simple approximation to account for the difference in position between the stream and the orbit of the progenitor; this significantly affects the best-fitting orbits. The progenitor orbits we derive have orbital apocentre ~60kpc and pericentre ~3kpc, though these quantities vary somewhat with the current orbital phase of the progenitor which is as yet unknown. Our best combined fit to the stream and galaxy properties implies a mass within 125 kpc of M31 of (7.4 +/- 1.2) × 1011Msolar. Based on its length, width, luminosity, and velocity dispersion, we conclude that the stream originates from a progenitor satellite with mass Ms~ 109Msolar, and at most modest amounts of dark matter; the estimate of Ms is again correlated with the phase of the progenitor. M31 displays a large number of faint features in its inner halo which may be progenitors or continuations of the stream. While the orbital fits are not constrained enough for us to conclusively identify the progenitor, we can identify several plausible candidates, of which a feature in the planetary nebula distribution found by Merrett et al. is the most plausible, and rule out several others. We make predictions for the kinematic properties of the successful candidates. These may aid in observational identification of the progenitor object, which would greatly constrain the allowed models of the stream.},

	Abstract = {This paper is the first in a series which studies interactions between M31 and its satellites, including the origin of the giant southern stream. We construct accurate yet simple analytic models for the potential of the M31 galaxy to provide an easy basis for the calculation of orbits in M31's halo. We use a Navarro, Frenk and White (NFW) dark halo, an exponential disc, a Hernquist bulge, and a central black hole point mass to describe the galaxy potential. We constrain the parameters of these functions by comparing to existing surface-brightness, velocity-dispersion, and rotation-curve measurements of M31. Our description provides a good fit to the observations, and agrees well with more sophisticated modelling of M31. While in many respects the parameter set is well constrained, there is substantial uncertainty in the outer halo potential and a near-degeneracy between the disc and halo components, producing a large, nearly two-dimensional allowed region in parameter space. We limit the allowed region using theoretical expectations for the halo concentration, baryonic content, and stellar mass-to-light ratio (M/LR), finding a smaller region where the parameters are physically plausible. Our proposed mass model for M31 has Mbulge= 3.2 × 1010Msolar, Mdisc= 7.2 × 1010Msolar, and M200= 7.1 × 1011Msolar, with uncorrected (for internal and foreground extinction) mass-to-light ratios of M/LR= 3.9 and 3.3 for the bulge and disc, respectively. We present some illustrative test-particle orbits for the progenitor of the stellar stream in our galaxy potential, highlighting the effects of the remaining uncertainty in the disc and halo masses.},

	Abstract = {Using the HST ACS, we have obtained deep optical images reaching well below the oldest main-sequence turnoff in fields on the southeast minor axis of the Andromeda galaxy, 35 kpc from the nucleus. These data probe the star formation history in the extended halo of Andromeda-that region beyond 30 kpc that appears both chemically and morphologically distinct from the metal-rich, highly disturbed inner spheroid. The present data, together with our previous data for fields at 11 and 21 kpc, do not show a simple trend toward older ages and lower metallicities, as one might expect for populations further removed from the obvious disturbances of the inner spheroid. Specifically, at 11, 21, and 35 kpc, the mean ages are 9.7, 11.0, and 10.5 Gyr, respectively, and the mean [Fe/H] values are -0.65, -0.87, and -0.98, respectively. In the best-fit model of the 35 kpc population, one-third of the stars are younger than 10 Gyr, whereas only ~10% of the stars are truly ancient and metal-poor. The extended halo thus exhibits clear evidence of its hierarchical assembly, and the contribution from any classical halo formed via early monolithic collapse must be small.

	Abstract = {We present the results of deep I- and V-band photometry of the halo stars near the southeast minor axis of the Local Group spiral galaxy M33. An (I,V-I) color-magnitude diagram distinctly reveals the red giant branch stars at the bright end of the color-magnitude diagram. A luminosity function in the I band that uses a background field to remove the contaminating effects of Galactic foreground stars and distant, unresolved galaxies reveals the presence of the tip of the red giant branch at (m-M)I=20.70+/-0.10. Assuming an absolute magnitude of the tip of the red giant branch of MI,TRGB=-4.1+/-0.1 and a foreground reddening of E(V-I)=0.054+/-0.020, the distance modulus of M33 is determined to be (m-M)0=24.72+/-0.14 (880+/-60 kpc). The metallicity distribution function derived by interpolating between evolutionary tracks of red giant branch models is dominated by a relatively metal-poor stellar population, with a mean metallicity of [M/H]=-0.94+/-0.04 or [Fe/H]=-1.24. We fit a leaky-box chemical enrichment model to the halo data, which shows that the halo is well represented by a single-component model with an effective yield of yeff=0.0024. The mean metallicity of a sample of globular clusters in the M33 halo ([Fe/H]=-1.3+/-0.1) matches very closely the metallicity of the halo, but the cluster sample is too small to investigate other aspects of the metallicity distribution function of the clusters.},

@article{Beasley:2005,
	Abstract = {We derive ages, metallicities, and abundance ratios ([α/Fe]) from the integrated spectra of 23 globular clusters in M31 by employing multivariate fits to two different stellar population models. We also perform a parallel analysis on 21 Galactic globular clusters as a consistency check and in order to facilitate a differential analysis. Our analysis shows that the M31 globular clusters separate into three distinct components in age and metallicity; we identify an old, metal-poor group (seven clusters), an old, metal-rich group (10 clusters), and an intermediate-age (3-6 Gyr), intermediate-metallicity ([Z/H]~-1) group (six clusters). This third group is not identified in the Galactic globular cluster sample. We also see evidence that the old, metal-rich Galactic globular clusters are 1-2 Gyr older than their counterparts in M31. The majority of globular clusters in both samples appear to be enhanced in α-elements, but the degree of enhancement is rather model-dependent. The intermediate-age globular clusters appear to be the most enhanced, with [α/Fe]~0.4. These clusters are clearly depressed in CN with respect to the models and the bulk of the M31 and Milky Way sample. Compared with the bulge of M31, M32, and NGC 205, these clusters most resemble the stellar populations in NGC 205 in terms of age, metallicity, and CN abundance. We infer horizontal branch morphologies for the M31 clusters using the Rose Ca II index and demonstrate that blue horizontal branches are not leading to erroneous age estimates in our analysis. We discuss and reject as unlikely the hypothesis that these objects are in fact foreground stars contaminating the optical catalogs. The intermediate-age clusters have generally higher velocities than the bulk of the M31 cluster population. Spatially, three of these clusters are projected onto the bulge region, and the remaining three are distributed at large radii. We discuss these objects within the context of the build-up of the M31 halo and suggest that these clusters possibly originated in a gas-rich dwarf galaxy, which may or may not be presently observable in M31.},

At large distances from the source the outflow collimates into jets along the rotation axis. Being almost cylindrically symmetric even close to the source of the outflow, the density distribution appears more jetlike than the collection of streamlines, which always contains a few members that skim over the surface of the disk.},

	Abstract = {PPak is a new fiber-based integral field unit (IFU) developed at the Astrophysical Institute of Potsdam and implemented as a module into the existing Potsdam Multi-Aperture Spectrophotometer (PMAS) spectrograph. The purpose of PPak is to provide an extended field of view with a large light-collecting power for each spatial element, as well as an adequate spectral resolution. The PPak system consists of a fiber bundle with 331 object fibers, 36 sky fibers, and 15 calibration fibers. The object and sky fibers collect the light from the focal plane behind a focal reducer lens. The object fibers of PPak, each 2.7" in diameter, provide a contiguous hexagonal field of view of 74" × 64" on the sky, with a filling factor of 60%. The operational wavelength range is from 400 to 900 nm. The PPak IFU, together with the PMAS spectrograph, are intended for the study of extended, low surface brightness objects, offering an optimization of total light-collecting power and spectral resolution. This paper describes the instrument design, the assembly, integration, and tests, the commissioning and operational procedures, and presents the measured performance at the telescope.},

@article{Roth:2005,
	Abstract = {We describe the design, manufacture, commissioning, and performance of PMAS, the Potsdam Multi-Aperture Spectrophotometer. PMAS is a dedicated integral field spectrophotometer optimized to cover the optical wavelength regime of 0.35-1 μm. It is based on the lens array-fiber bundle principle of operation. The instrument employs an all-refractive fiber spectrograph, built with CaF2 optics, to provide good transmission and high image quality over the entire nominal wavelength range. A set of user-selectable reflective gratings provides low to medium spectral resolution of approximately 1.5, 3.2, and 7 {\AA} in first order, depending on the groove density (1200, 600, 300 grooves mm-1). While the standard integral field unit (IFU) uses a 16×16 element lens array, which provides seeing-limited sampling in a relatively small field of view (FOV) in one of three magnifications (8" × 8", 12" × 12", or 16" × 16"), a recently retrofitted bare fiber bundle IFU (PPak: PMAS fiber pack) expands the FOV to a hexagonal area with a footprint of 65" × 74". Other special features include a cryogenic CCD camera for field acquisition and guiding, a nod-shuffle mode for beam switching and improved sky background subtraction, and a scanning Fabry-P{\'e}rot etalon in combination with the standard IFU (PYTHEAS mode). PMAS was initially designed and built as an experimental traveling instrument with optical interfaces to various telescopes (Calar Alto 3.5 m, ESO VLT, LBT). It is offered as a common-user instrument at Calar Alto under contract to MPIA Heidelberg since 2002.},

@article{Allington-Smith:2007a,
	Abstract = {We present results on the performance of the integral field spectroscopy (IFS) capability of the Gemini Near-Infrared Spectrograph installed on the Gemini-North telescope. This makes use of the innovative Advanced Image Slicer optical concept described in Paper 1 and uses new developments in diamond-machining to produce its complex micro-optics. The system delivers near-optimal performance for IFS in a small package that can be adapted to work with a wide range of spectrographs.
In this paper, we present results of extensive tests carried out on the telescope to verify the measurements of throughput, image quality and scattered light obtained in the laboratory and characterize the instrument's geometry and spectroscopic performance. This shows that the performance model, when fed with results of the component surface metrology, provides a good match to the throughput of the integral field unit measured on the telescope between 1 and 2.5 μm (65 and 90 per cent, respectively). At longer wavelengths, the throughput exceeds 90 per cent and the way that the design handles diffraction means that its performance can actually exceed that of the spectrograph alone with a slit of equivalent width.

We also present examples of data obtained during commissioning and system verification and compare this with data obtained in other ways, to verify the system performance in recovering astrophysical data. Finally, we review the performance and its relevance to future terrestrial and space observatories, in particular for large-scale multiple-IFS applications. We make the case that our design is of great relevance to instrumentation for Extremely Large Telescopes. We show that the throughput can be improved further by techniques to improve the quality of the optical surfaces.},

	Abstract = {The hypothesis that strong differential rotation coupled with the preferential appearance of higher latitude hot spots on classical T Tauri stars (CTTS) and low latitude cool spots on naked T Tauri stars (NTTS) can account for the apparent difference in the rotation periods of the two groups of stars is tested. It is shown that the required level of differential rotation produces measurable changes in the profile shapes of the photospheric absorption lines. High spectral resolution observations of 1 NTTS (HDE 283572; vsini=~110km/s) and 2 CTTS (SU Aur; vsini=~66km/s and RY Tau; vsini=~50km/s) are analyzed for the presence of differential rotation. It is shown that these stars are consistent with solid-body rotation and rule out the strong differential rotation required to explain the rotation period difference between CTTS and NTTS. This further supports the hypothesis that CTTS do in fact rotate slower than NTTS due to the interaction of stellar magnetic fields with the accretion disks which surround CTTS. In addition, a more accurate measure of vsini=~80km/s for HDE 283572 is given.},

	Abstract = {A technique for imaging the surfaces of certain rapidly rotating spotted stars is discussed. The method exploits the correspondence between wavelength position across a rotationally broadened spectral line and spatial position across the stellar disk. Preliminary Doppler Images of the RS CVn star HR 1099 show spots which exhibit a striking similarity in shape and location to X ray images of solar coronal holes. It is suggested that the large star spots on RS CVn's and other active late-type stars emerge at low latitude as scaled-up analogs of solar complexes, but as they migrate poleward, they more closely resemble photospheric analogs of solar coronal holes. The evolution of starspots appears remarkably similar to that of large-scale magnetic fields of the sun.},

@article{Basri:1992,
	Abstract = {Magnetic fields on two weak-emission-line T Tauri stars were detected by searching for the enhancement of the equivalent widths of Zeeman-sensitive absorption lines. For both stars, 26 observed Fe I lines, which represent a wide range of Zeeman sensitivities, are synthesized using an LTE Stokes line-transfer calculation. The theoretical growth of equivalent width with magnetic field is discussed for lines with various Zeeman patterns. Oscillator strengths for all lines are empirically determined a priori using a magnetically quiet star of similar spectral type. The iron abundances of both T Tauri stars are established by synthesizing lines that are insensitive to Zeeman splitting. The observed equivalent widths of Zeeman-sensitive lines in TAP 35 are found to be systematically enhanced relative to those calculated for no magnetic field, while such an enhancement is not seen in Zeeman-insensitive lines.},

@article{Kenyon:1987,
	Abstract = {The authors analyze spectral energy distributions of T Tauri stars (TTS) to place limits on disk accretion in this early phase of stellar evolution. The results reinforce the conclusion of Adams, Lada, and Shu that much of the infrared excess emission arises from reprocessing of stellar radiation by a dusty circumstellar disk. Observational constraints on disk geometries and disk masses are derived. The relative importance of accretion and solar-type chromospheric activity in T Tauri stars is assessed. The present analysis indicates that disk accretion in the T Tauri phase does not modify stellar evolution significantly and that the angular momentum of accreted material can be lost in a stellar wind.},

@article{Valenti:1993,
	Abstract = {We present an atlas of 96 low dispersion spectra of T Tauri stars, both classical and weak-lined. The flux-calibrated spectra extend from H-Beta to well blueward of the Balmer jump. Observed equivalent widths and rough blue veilings are presented. We model stars with excess emission as a combination of a weak-lined T Tauri star of a similar spectral type and a slab of hot hydrogen. We tabulate the physical parameters of the slab, and give both intrinsic and observed Balmer jumps. The region responsible for the excess blue continuum has a high density and small surface area, in agreement with previous work. This is consistent with the boundary layer hypothesis, but not unique to it. We suggest that the emission region may actually be the stellar photosphere, heated by accretion shocks at the footprints of magnetic loops extending to the disk. We find that observed infrared excesses are often many times higher than predicted by simple accretion disk models (including reprocessing). The blue excess is more likely to be diagnostic of the actual accretion rate onto the star than the infrared. Typical values for this are a few 10-8 solar mass/yr. Some accreting material may not make it to the star, but is turned around into a wind near the star. The line strengths from the model agree qualitatively with observations of the upper Balmer lines, but are increasingly underestimated for the lower Balmer lines. Including both low and high optical depth components yields better agreement. No weak-lined stars are found to have a Balmer emission jump, confirming that an accretion disk is required to produce this feature in pre-main-sequence stars.},

	Abstract = {We present new grids of pre-main sequence (PMS) tracks for stars in the mass range 0.1 to 7.0 M_sun. The computations were performed for four different metallicities (Z=0.01, 0.02, 0.03 and 0.04). A fifth table has been computed for the solar composition (Z=0.02), including a moderate overshooting. We describe the update in the physics of the Grenoble stellar evolution code which concerns mostly changes in the equation of state (EOS) adopting the formalism proposed by Pols et al. (1995) and in the treatment of the boundary condition. Comparisons of our models with other grids demonstrate the validity of this EOS in the domain of very low-mass stars. Finally, we present a new server dedicated to PMS stellar evolution which allows the determination of stellar parameters from observational data, the calculation of isochrones, the retrieval of evolutionary files and the possibility to generate graphic outputs.},

	Abstract = {A method for separating the 'veiling' continuum often present in T Tauri stars from the underlying photospheric spectrum is described. Echelle observations from 5100 to 6800 A of the partially veiled T Tauri star BP Tau were analyzed to determine the shape of the veiling spectrum. The residuals of the fit indicate the deviation of the veiling spectrum from a simple continuum and identify the location and strength of any emission-line components. It is shown, by means of goodness-of-fit tests, that the spectrum of BP Tau can be decomposed into a normal stellar spectrum plus a smooth veiling continuum with only a few emission lines superposed. The continuum dominates the veiling spectrum in this spectral region; the veiling does not arise from numerous deep photospheric absorption lines that are filled in by weak emission.},

	Abstract = {Earlier calculations of the infrared emission expected from stars in the process of being made are corrected to include the most important observable effects of rotation and generalized. An improved version of the spherical model of a previous paper is developed, and the corresponding emergent spectral energy distributions are calculated for the theoretically expected mass infall rate in the cores of cool and quiescent molecular clouds. The dust grain opacity model and the temperature profile parameterization are improved. It is shown that the infrared spectrum of the IRAS source 04264+2426, which is associated with a Herbig-Haro object, can be adequately represented in terms of a rotating and accreting protostar. This strengthens the suggestion that collimated outflows in young stellar objects originate when a stellar wind tries to emerge and reverse the swirling pattern of infall which gave birth to the central star.},

These observations enable determination of broad-band energy distributions for 32 of the 44 sources known to be embedded in the cloud. The majority of the sources emit the bulk of their luminosity between 1 μm and 20 μm. These sources apparently are surrounded by dust shells and are probably pre-main-sequence in nature. It is found that the embedded cluster is predominantly composed of low-luminosity objects with luminosities in the range 0.1 ≤ L/L_sun; ≤ 25. When corrected for observational selection effects, the resulting luminosity function appears to be deficient in intermediate-luminosity stars compared with the luminosity function for field stars.},

It is shown that the AS models adequately explain the emergent spectral energy distributions of unidentified objects with negative spectral indices in the mid-IR and near-IR in both Taurus and Ophiuchus. If the infalling dust envelope is then completely removed, the spectra of the underlying stars and nebular disks used by AS provide a natural explanation for the near-IR and mid-IR excesses and the positive spectral indices of embedded T Tauri stars. It is found that the addition of a simple physical model for residual dust envelopes can reproduce the far-IR excesses found in some of these T Tauri stars.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents simultaneous high-resolution spectra and spectrophotometric observations of a sample of 22 weak-lined and classical T Tauri stars in the Taurus-Auriga dark cloud. The reddening, stellar luminosities, variability, optical excess luminosities, and IR excess luminosities of these stars are estimated. It is found that previous studies have systematically underestimated the extinction toward T Tauri stars by as much as 50 percent because they ignored the color changes introduced by the optical excess emission. New values for the stellar luminosities of the program objects do not differ significantly from those obtained from near-IR studies. Simple models indicate that the optical excesses arise from regions with densities about 10 exp 14/cu cm, temperature of about 9000 K, optical depths between about 0.2 and 5, and covering factors of about 5 percent of the stellar surface area. The mass accretion rates inferred from the excess are typically about 10 exp -7 solar mass/yr.},

	Abstract = {We present a performance analysis of SparsePak and the WIYN Bench Spectrograph for precision studies of stellar and ionized gas kinematics of external galaxies. We focus on spectrograph configurations with echelle and low-order gratings yielding spectral resolutions of ~10,000 between 500 and 900 nm. These configurations are of general relevance to the spectrograph performance. Benchmarks include spectral resolution, sampling, vignetting, scattered light, and an estimate of the system absolute throughput. Comparisons are made to other, existing, fiber feeds on the WIYN Bench Spectrograph. Vignetting and relative throughput are found to agree with a geometric model of the optical system. An aperture-correction protocol for spectrophotometric standard-star calibrations has been established using independent WIYN imaging data and the unique capabilities of the SparsePak fiber array. The WIYN point-spread function is well fitted by a Moffat profile with a constant power-law outer slope of index -4.4. We use SparsePak commissioning data to debunk a long-standing myth concerning sky-subtraction with fibers: by properly treating the multifiber data as a ``long-slit'' it is possible to achieve precision sky-subtraction with a signal-to-noise performance as good or better than conventional long-slit spectroscopy. No beam-switching is required, and hence the method is efficient. Finally, we give several examples of science measurements that SparsePak now makes routine. These include Hα velocity fields of low surface brightness disks, gas and stellar velocity-fields of nearly face-on disks, and stellar absorption-line profiles of galaxy disks at spectral resolutions of ~24,000.},

	Abstract = {We describe the design and construction of a formatted fiber field unit, SparsePak, and characterize its optical and astrometric performance. This array is optimized for spectroscopy of low surface brightness extended sources in the visible and near-infrared. SparsePak contains 82, 4.7" fibers subtending an area of 72''×71'' in the telescope focal plane and feeds the WIYN Bench Spectrograph. Together, these instruments are capable of achieving spectral resolutions of λ/Δλ~20,000 and an area-solid angle product of ~140 arcsec2 m2 per fiber. Laboratory measurements of SparsePak lead to several important conclusions on the design of fiber termination and cable curvature to minimize focal ratio degradation. SparsePak itself has throughput above 80% redward of 5200 {\AA} and 90%-92% in the red. Fed at f/6.3, the cable delivers an output of 90% encircled energy at nearly f/5.2. This has implications for performance gains if the WIYN Bench Spectrograph were to have a faster collimator. Our approach to integral-field spectroscopy yields an instrument that is simple and inexpensive to build, yet yields the highest area-solid angle product per spectrum of any system in existence. An Appendix details the fabrication process in sufficient detail for others to repeat. SparsePak was funded by the National Science Foundation and the University of Wisconsin-Madison Graduate School, and is now publicly available on the WIYN Telescope through the National Optical Astronomical Observatories.},

	Abstract = {We present high-resolution (R~=18,000), high signal-to-noise ratio, 2 μm spectra of 52 IR-selected Class I and flat-spectrum young stellar objects in the Taurus-Auriga, ρ Ophiuchi, Serpens, Perseus, and Corona Australis dark clouds. We detect key absorption lines in 41 objects and fit synthetic spectra generated from pre-main-sequence models to deduce the effective temperatures, surface gravities, near-IR veilings, rotation velocities, and radial velocities of each of these 41 sources. We find these objects to span ranges in effective temperature, surface gravity, and stellar luminosity that appear similar to those of late spectral type Class II sources and classical T Tauri stars. However, because of significant but uncertain corrections for scattering and extinction, the derived luminosities for the embedded protostellar objects must be regarded as being highly uncertain. We determine that the mean 2 μm veiling of Class I and flat-spectrum objects is significantly higher than that of Class II objects in the same region where both types of objects are extensively observed (ρ Oph). We find that a significant fraction of our protostellar sample also exhibits emission lines. Twenty-three objects show H2 emission, which is usually indicative of the presence of energetic outflows. Thirty-four sources show H I Brγ emission, and a number of these exhibit profile asymmetries consistent with infall. Eight sources show significant Δv=2 CO emission suggestive of emission from a circumstellar disk. Overall, these observations indicate that Class I and flat-spectrum objects are self-embedded protostars undergoing significant mass accretion, although the objects appear to span a broad range of mass accretion activity.

@article{White:2004,
	Abstract = {We present high-resolution (R~34,000) optical (6330-8750 {\AA}) spectra obtained with the HIRES spectrograph on the W. M. Keck I telescope of stars in Taurus-Auriga whose circumstellar environment suggests that they are less evolved than optically revealed T Tauri stars. Many of the stars are seen only via scattered light. The sample includes 15 class I stars and all class II stars that power Herbig-Haro flows in this region. For 28 of the 36 stars observed, our measurements are the first high-dispersion optical spectra ever obtained. Photospheric features are observed in all stars with detected continuum, 11 of 15 class I stars (42% of known Taurus class I stars) and 21 of 21 class II stars; strong emission lines (e.g., Hα) are detected in the spectra of all stars. These spectra, in combination with previous measurements, are used to search for differences between stars that power Herbig-Haro flows and stars that do not and to reassess the evolutionary state of so-called protostars (class I stars) relative to optically revealed T Tauri stars (class II stars). The stellar mass distribution of class I stars is similar to that of class II stars and includes three spectroscopically confirmed class I brown dwarfs. Class I stars (and brown dwarfs) in Taurus are slowly rotating (vsini<35 km s-1) the angular momentum of a young star appears to dissipate prior to the optically revealed T Tauri phase. The amount of optical veiling and the inferred mass accretion rates of class I stars are surprisingly indistinguishable from class II stars. Class I stars do not have accretion-dominated luminosities; the accretion luminosity accounts for ~25% of the bolometric luminosity. The median mass accretion rate of class I and class II stars of K7-M1 spectral type is 4×10-8Msolar yr-1, and the median mass outflow rate is 5% of the mass accretion rate. The large ranges in mass accretion rate (~2 orders of magnitude), mass outflow rate (~3 orders of magnitude), and the ratio of these quantities (~2 orders of magnitude) represent real dispersions in young accreting stars of similar mass. We confirm previous results that find larger forbidden-line emission associated with class I stars than class II stars. We suggest that this is caused by an orientation bias that allows a more direct view of the somewhat extended forbidden emission line regions than of the obscured stellar photospheres, rather than being caused by larger mass outflow rates. Overall, the similar masses, luminosities, rotation rates, mass accretion rates, mass outflow rates, and millimeter flux densities of class I stars and class II stars are best explained by a scenario in which most class I stars are no longer in the main accretion phase and are much older than traditionally assumed. Similarly, although stars that power Herbig-Haro flows appear to have larger mass outflow rates, their stellar and circumstellar properties are generally indistinguishable from those of similar mass stars that do not power these flows.

	Abstract = {In this paper we investigate how mass outflows from young stars relate to circumstellar disks by analyzing spectroscopic data of 42 T Tauri stars that span a broad range of infrared excesses. We measure the optical excess continuum (veiling) in each star from high-resolution 4 m spectra and extract forbidden line profiles uncontaminated by terrestrial night-sky emission, photospheric absorption lines, and telluric absorption lines. The veiling fluxes combined with existing infrared photometry allow us to estimate reddenings and stellar luminosities for the first time for heavily veiled stars. The new estimates of the stellar luminosities of these objects indicate that the stars with the highest accretion rates are the youngest in the sample. There is a one-to-one correspondence between forbidden line emission, veiling, and near-infrared color excess among the stars in our sample; all disks around young stars which are both optically thick and extend inward to within a few stellar radii of the stellar surface are, in fact, accretion disks, and have forbidden line emission. Residual forbidden line profiles of [0 1] 6300, [0 1] 5577, - [S I 6731, and [N ii] 6583 represent a range of critical densities from 10 to 108 cm -3. We have determined luminosities and line ratios for the two distinct velocity components in each of these forbidden lines. The high-velocity component resembles a dense stellar jet but requires more than a single shock to account for the observed line ratios. Luminosities of the high-velocity component indicate mass-loss rates of 10-8 to 10-10 M_{0 }yr ^{1 }for most stars and disk accre- tion rates derived from the veiling fluxes are 10-6 to 10-8 M_{0 }yr . The mass outflow rates and mass accretion rates are correlated. The ratio of mass outflow rate to the mass accretion rate depends upon how the forbidden line luminosities are interpreted but is probably 0.01 for most classical T Tauri stars. The low-velocity component originates in a region of higher density than the high-velocity component and is characterized by a small negative radial velocity (-5 km s `), possibly associated with a disk wind or magnetic accretion columns. The velocity shifts are largest for forbidden lines with the lowest critical density, suggesting that the low-velocity component accelerates away from the surface of the disk. If the low-velocity component arises on the surface of a disk in Keplerian rotation, then the observed profiles imply a disk surface brightness which decreases as r -2.2},

A comparison of Lick and McDonald observations of HD 153882 reveals no significant difference in slopes or zero points of the two magnetic fields indicating that the systematic scale difference of 30-40% is probably instrumental in origin. Observations of the magnetic variable beta Cor Bor revealed a more nearly sinusoidal magnetic curve with less internal scatter than the photographically determined field measures of the Lick and Mauna Kea Zeeman systems. Investigation of periodicity in the secularly varying magnetic minima of beta Cor Bor did not yield evidence of previously noted periodicities other than that expected from the time structure of the data sampling.},

	Abstract = {We examine several theories that describe how stellar magnetic fields on classical T Tauri stars (CTTSs) interact with their surrounding accretion disks. We demonstrate that these theories require magnetic field strengths ranging from a few hundred to several thousand gauss, depending on which model is used and more importantly on the properties of individual systems. For example, the CTTS BP Tau is predicted to have a relatively strong magnetic field (1.4-4.1 kG), which should be detectable. We present infrared (IR) and optical echelle spectra of BP Tau and several reference stars of similar spectral class. Using detailed spectrum synthesis and the latest model atmospheres, we fitted 12 absorption features in the optical spectrum, including the strong titanium oxide (TiO) band head at 7055 {\AA}. For BP Tau we determine key stellar parameters: effective temperature (T_eff=4055+/-112 K), gravity (logg=3.67+/-0.50), metallicity ([M/H]=0.18+/-0.11), projected rotational velocity (vsini=10.2+/-1.8 km s^-1), and optical veiling (r=0.00-0.15). A similar analysis of 61 Cyg B (K7 V) is used to validate the methodology. We then use the IR spectra to look for Zeeman broadening, which has a more pronounced effect at longer wavelengths. A Zeeman sensitive Ti I line at 2.2233 μm appears significantly broadened in BP Tau, relative to several rotationally broadened standard stars. The observed line is also significantly broader than predictions based on our optical analysis. Interpreting this excess broadening as Zeeman splitting of the Ti I line, we fitted the spectrum and find a distribution of field strengths whose surface averaged mean is B=2.6+/-0.3 kG. We did not use the Zeeman sensitive Fe I line at 8468.4 {\AA} when determining stellar or magnetic parameters for BP Tau, so this line provides a test of our results. The observed line profile is indeed broader than the nonmagnetic prediction, but the 8468.4 {\AA} line gives a magnetic flux lower than what was obtained in the IR, perhaps indicating that strong fields are concentrated into cool spots. Finally, we investigate an ad hoc model in which the IR line is assumed to form in the accretion disk itself. We discuss several reasons why the magnetic model is preferred, but the disk atmosphere example illustrates that our magnetic field measurement must still be tested using several IR lines with a range of Zeeman sensitivities.},

	Abstract = {We examine three analytic theories of magnetospheric accretion onto classical T Tauri stars (CTTSs) under the assumption that the magnetic field strength does not vary appreciably from star to star. From these investigations we derive predicted relationships among the stellar mass, radius, rotation period, and disk accretion rate. Data from five studies of the accretion parameters of CTTSs are used to test the predicted correlations. We generally find that the data do not display the predicted correlations except for that predicted by the model of Shu et al. as detailed by Ostriker & Shu and extended here to include nondipole field topologies. Their identification of the trapped flux as an important quantity in the model appears to be critical for reconciling the observed data to the theory. While the data do generally support the extended Ostriker & Shu predictions, only one of the two studies for which the requisite data exist shows the highest correlation when considering all the relevant parameters. This suggests that great care must be taken when trying to use existing observations to test the theory.},

	Abstract = {We analyze K-band infrared (IR) spectra of 14 classical and nine naked T Tauri stars. Using five lines of CO, we determine v sin i and show that IR and optical measurements agree well. From this we conclude that K-band absorption lines generally form in the stellar photosphere. Using line equivalent widths, we measure K-band veiling for classical T Tauri stars in our sample. Accretion disk models constrained by existing stellar and accretion parameters yield testable predictions for K-band veiling. In the context of these models, we examine sources of IR emission from the disk. The importance of disk reprocessing of emission from the accretion shock as material strikes the stellar surface is shown. We then show that current models constrained by the most recent estimates of mass accretion have a difficult time reproducing many of our high-veiling results. We suggest that dust out of the plane of the accretion disk (possibly in the magnetospheric flow itself) may account for much of the emission missing in the models.},

	Abstract = {High-resolution (R ~ 60,000) circular spectropolarimetry of the classical T Tauri star BP Tauri is presented. No net polarization is detected in photospheric absorption lines, placing strong limits (3 sigma) on the mean longitudinal magnetic field (+/-200 G) that is present over the surface of the star. On the other hand, strong circular polarization is measured in the He I lambda5876 emission line of BP Tau, indicating a mean longitudinal magnetic field of 2460+/-120 G in the line formation region. This implies that accretion occurs preferentially along large-scale magnetic loops that occupy a small fraction of the stellar surface. These observations represent the first direct evidence for magnetically controlled accretion onto classical T Tauri stars.},

	Abstract = {This paper reports the results of five years (five runs, 23 nights) of spectropolarimetric observations of active stars with the UCL Echelle Spectrograph of the Anglo-Australian Telescope. A total of 225 circularly (and four linearly) polarized spectra were recorded on 28 objects (21 active stars and seven calibration standards) using the new technique of Zeeman-Doppler imaging. To extract polarization echelle spectra from raw frames, we developed a new dedicated automatic software package (called ESPRIT, which utilizes optimal extraction techniques) whose detailed description is given. For each recorded spectrum, we extract 'mean' polarized and unpolarized profiles using 'least-squares deconvolution', a technique similar to cross-correlation, which can enhance enormously the sensitivity of Zeeman-Doppler imaging, by up to 7.5 mag in flux with respect to a single average line analysis. Magnetic field is detected unambiguously on 14 objects. Marginal field detections are also obtained for the weak-line T Tauri star HD 283572 and the Herbig Ae star HD 104237.},

	Abstract = {The possibility that the Balmer emission lines of T Tauri stars arise in infalling envelopes rather than winds is considered. Line profiles for the upper Balmer lines are presented for models with cone geometry, intended to simulate the basic features of magnetospheric accretion from a circumstellar disk. An escape probability treatment is used to determine line source functions in nonspherically symmetric geometry. Thermalization effects are found to produce nearly symmetric H-alpha line profiles at the same time the higher Balmer series lines exhibit inverse P Cygni profiles. The infall models produce centrally peaked emission line wings, in good agreement with observations of many T Tauri stars. It is suggested that the Balmer emission of many T Tauri stars may be produced in an infalling envelope, with blue shifted absorption contributed by an overlying wind. Some of the observed narrow absorption components with small blueshifts may also arise in the accretion column.},

@article{Bouvier:2007,
	Abstract = {Context: Accretion and ejection are complex and related processes that vary on various timescales in young stars. Aims: We intend to investigate the accretion and outflow dynamics and their interaction from observations of the classical T Tauri star AA Tau. Methods: From a long time series of high resolution (R=115 000) HARPS spectra and simultaneous broad-band photometry, we report new evidence for magnetospheric accretion as well as ejection processes in the nearly edge-on classical T Tauri star AA Tau. Results: AA Tau's light curve is modulated with a period of 8.22 d. The recurrent luminosity dips are due to the periodic occultation of the central star by the magnetically-warped inner disk edge located at about 9 R_⋆. Balmer line profiles exhibit a clear rotational modulation of high-velocity redshifted absorption components with a period of 8.22 days as well, with a maximum strength when the main accretion funnel flow passes through the line of sight. At the same time, the luminosity of the system decreases by about 1 mag, indicative of circumstellar absorption of the stellar photosphere by the magnetically-warped, corotating inner disk edge. The photospheric and He I radial velocities also exhibit periodic variations, and the veiling is modulated by the appearance of the accretion shock at the bottom of the accretion funnel. Diagnostics of hot winds and their temporal behaviour are also presented. Conclusions: .The peculiar geometry of the young AA Tau system (nearly edge-on) allows us to uniquely probe the acretion-ejection region close to the star. We find that most spectral and photometric diagnostics vary as expected from models of magnetically-channelled accretion in young stars, with a large scale magnetosphere tilted by 20$\,^{\circ}$ onto the star's spin axis. We also find evidence for time variability of the magnetospheric accretion flow on a timescale of a few rotational periods.

It consists of an Integral Field Unit (IFU) which slices and re-arranges the initial field along the entrance slit of a spectrograph. This article presents an original design of IFU based on the advanced image slicer concept. To reduce optical aberrations, pupil and slit mirrors are disposed in a fan-shaped configuration that means that angles between incident and reflected beams on each elements are minimized. The fan-shaped image slicer improves image quality in terms of wavefront error by a factor 2 comparing with classical image slicer and, furthermore it guaranties a negligible level of differential aberration in the field. As an exemple, we are presenting the design LAM used for its proposal at the NIRSPEC/IFU invitation of tender.},

	Abstract = {The Gemini Multiobject Spectrograph (GMOS) installed on the Gemini-North telescope has a facility for integral field spectroscopy over the wavelength range 0.4-1.0um. GMOS is converted to this mode by the remote insertion of an integral field unit (IFU) into the beam in place of the masks used for multiobject spectroscopy. With the IFU deployed, integral field spectroscopy is available over a fully-filled contiguous field of 5 x 7 arcsec with a sampling of 0.2 arcsec. A separate field of half the area, but otherwise identical, is also provided to aid background subtraction. The IFU contains 1500 lenslet-coupled fibres and is the largest-format fibre-based IFU yet tested on the sky and the first facility of any type for integral field spectroscopy employed on an 8/10m telescope. We describe the IFU and present results from commissioning.},

	Abstract = {We compare the stellar wind torque calculated in a previous work (Paper II) to the spin-up and spin-down torques expected to arise from the magnetic interaction between a slowly rotating (~10% of breakup) pre-main-sequence star and its accretion disk. This analysis demonstrates that stellar winds can carry off orders of magnitude more angular momentum than can be transferred to the disk, provided that the mass outflow rates are substantially greater than the solar wind. Thus, the equilibrium spin state is simply characterized by a balance between the angular momentum deposited by accretion and that extracted by a stellar wind. We derive a semianalytic formula for predicting the equilibrium spin rate as a function only of the ratio of {\.M}w/{\.M}a and a dimensionless magnetization parameter, Ψ≡B2*R2*({\.M}avesc)-1, where {\.M}w is the stellar wind mass outflow rate, {\.M}a is the accretion rate, B* is the stellar surface magnetic field strength, R* is the stellar radius, and vesc is the surface escape speed. For parameters typical of accreting pre-main-sequence stars, this explains spin rates of ~10% of breakup speed for {\.M}w/{\.M}a~0.1. Finally, the assumption that the stellar wind is driven by a fraction of the accretion power leads to an upper limit to the mass flow ratio of {\.M}w/{\.M}a<~0.6.},

	Abstract = {T Tauri stars (TTSs), their surroundings, and their common evolution toward the main sequence are discussed. The photospheric properties of TTSs and their solar-type outer atmospheres, recent evidence for circumstellar disks around classical TTSs (CTTSs), and CTTS mass outflows are examined. TTSs are depicted as complex systems whose properties depend mostly on the initial conditions of star formation and on their rotation rates, which appear to control the magnetodynamic activity in the stars. The most exotic traits of CTTSs are primarily due to the disk and its interaction with the star, and the properties of weak-line TTSs (WTTSs) are mainly manifestations of the enhanced solar-type magnetic activity expected from their rotation rates. CTTSs are expected to become WTTSs when their disks dissipate.},

	Abstract = {Free of any atmospheric contamination, HST provides the best available spectrophotometry from the far-UV to the near-IR for stars as faint as V~16. The HST CALSPEC standard star network is based on 3 standard candles: the hot, pure hydrogen white dwarf (WD) stars G191B2B, GD153, and GD71, which have Hubeny NLTE model flux calculations that require the atomic physics for only one atom. These model flux distributions are normalized to the absolute flux for Vega of 3.46x10^{-9} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1} \AA^{-1} at 5556\AA using precise Landolt V band photometry and the V bandpass function corrected for atmospheric transmission by M. Cohen. The 3 primary WD standards provide absolute flux calibrations for FOS, STIS, and NICMOS spectrophotometry from these instruments on the HST. About 32 stellar spectral energy distributions (SEDs) have been constructed with a primary pedigree from the STIS data, which extends from 1150 \AA for the hot stars to a long wavelength limit of 1\mu m. NICMOS grism spectrophotometry provides an extension to 1.9\mu m in the IR for 17 of the HST standards and longward to 2.5\mu m for a few of the brighter stars. Included among these HST standards are Vega, the Sloan standard BD+17$^{\circ}$4708, 3 bright solar analog candidates, 3 cool stars of type M or later, and 5 hot WDs. In addition, 4 K giants and 4 main sequence A-stars have NICMOS spectrophotometry from 0.8-2.5\mu m. The WD fluxes are compared to their modeled SEDs and demonstrate an internal precision of 1-2%, while the A-stars agree with the Cohen IR fluxes to ~2%. Three solar analog candidate stars differ from the solar spectrum by up to 10% in the region of heavy line blanketing from 3000-4000 \AA and show differences in shape of ~5% in the IR around 1.8\mu m.},

@article{Akritas:1996,
	Abstract = {Two new methods are proposed for linear regression analysis for data with measurement errors. Both methods are designed to accommodate intrinsic scatter in addition to measurement errors. The first method is a direct extension of the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator to allow for measurement errors. It is quite general in that (1) it allows for measurement errors on both variables (2) it permits the measurement errors for the two variables to be dependent, (3) it permits the magnitudes of the measurement errors to depend on the measurements, and (4) other "symmetric" lines such as the bisector and the orthogonal regression can be constructed. We refer to this method as BCES estimators (for bivariate correlated errors and intrinsic scatter). The second method is a weighted least squares (WLS) estimator, which applies only for the case in which the "independent" variable is measured without error and the magnitudes of the measurement errors on the "dependent" variable are independent of the measurements.
Several applications are made to extragalactic astronomy: the BCES method, when applied to data describing the color-luminosity relations for field galaxies, yields significantly different slopes than OLS and other estimators used in the literature. Simulations with artificial data sets are used to evaluate the small sample performance of the estimators. Not surprisingly, the least-biased results are obtained when color is treated as the dependent variable. The Tully-Fisher relation is another example for which the BCES method should be used because errors in luminosity and velocity are correlated because of inclination corrections. We also find, via simulations, that the WLS method is by far the best method for the Tolman surface-brightness test, producing the smallest variance in slope by an order of magnitude. Moreover, with WLS it is not necessary to "reduce" galaxies to a fiducial surface-brightness, since this model incorporates intrinsic scatter.},

	Abstract = {We review our current knowledge of the solar chemical composition as determined from photospheric absorption lines. In particular we describe the recent significant revisions of the solar abundances as a result of the application of a time-dependent, 3D hydrodynamical model of the solar atmosphere instead of 1D hydrostatic models. This has decreased the metal content in the solar convection zone by almost a factor of two compared with the widely used compilation by Anders & Grevesse (1989). While resolving a number of long-standings problems, the new 3D-based element abundances also pose serious challenges, most notably for helioseismology.},

	Abstract = {We analyze the global structure of 34 late-type, edge-on, undisturbed, disk galaxies spanning a wide range of mass. We measure structural parameters for the galaxies using two-dimensional least-squares fitting to our R-band photometry. The fits require both a thick and a thin disk to adequately fit the data. The thick disks have larger scale heights and longer scale lengths than the embedded thin disks by factors of ~2 and ~1.25, respectively. The observed structural parameters agree well with the properties of thick and thin disks derived from star counts in the Milky Way and from resolved stellar populations in nearby galaxies. We find that massive galaxies' luminosities are dominated by the thin disk. However, in low-mass galaxies (Vc<~120 km s-1) thick disk stars contribute nearly half the luminosity and dominate the stellar mass. Thus, although low-mass dwarf galaxies appear blue, the majority of their stars are probably quite old.
Our data are most easily explained by a formation scenario in which the thick disk is assembled through direct accretion of stellar material from merging satellites while the thin disk is formed from accreted gas. The baryonic fraction in the thin disk therefore constrains the gas richness of the merging pregalactic fragments. If we include the mass in H I as part of the thin disk, the thick disk contains <~10% of the baryons in high-mass galaxies and ~25%-30% of the baryons in low-mass galaxies. Our data, therefore, indicate that the fragments were quite gas rich at the time of merging (fgas=75%-90%). However, because low-mass galaxies have a smaller fraction of baryons in their thin disks, the pregalactic fragments from which they assembled must have been systematically more gas poor. We believe this trend results from increased outflow due to supernova-driven winds in the lower mass pregalactic fragments. We estimate that ~60% of the total baryonic mass in these systems was lost due to outflows. Pushing the episode of significant winds to early times allows the mass-metallicity relationship for disks to be established early, before the main disk is assembled, and obviates the difficulty in driving winds from diffuse disks with low star formation efficiencies. We discuss other implications of this scenario for solving the G dwarf problem, for predicting abundance trends in thick disks, and for removing discrepancies between semianalytic galaxy formation models and the observed colors of low-mass galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We present kinematic measurements of thin- and thick-disk components in a sample of nine edge-on galaxies. We extract stellar and ionized gas rotation curves at and above the galaxies' midplanes using the Ca II triplet absorption features and Hα emission lines measured with the GMOS spectrographs on Gemini-North and Gemini-South. For the higher mass galaxies in the sample, we fail to detect differences between the thin- and thick-disk kinematics. In the lower mass galaxies, there is a wide range of thick-disk behavior, including thick disks with substantial lag and one counterrotating thick disk. We compare our rotation curves with expectations from thick-disk formation models and conclude that the wide variety of thick-disk kinematics favors a formation scenario in which thick-disk stars are accreted or formed during merger events as opposed to models that form thick disks through gradual thin-disk heating.},

	Abstract = {We have measured Lick index equivalent widths to derive luminosity weighted stellar ages and metallicities for thin- and thick-disk-dominated regions of nine edge-on disk galaxies with the ARC 3.5 m telescope at Apache Point Observatory. In all cases, the thick disks are confirmed to be old stellar populations, with typical ages between 4 and 10 Gyr. The thin disks are uniformly younger than the thick disks, and show strong radial age gradients, with the outer regions of the disks being younger than 1 Gyr. We do not detect any significant metallicity differences or α-element enhancement in the thick-disk stars compared to the thin disk, due to the insensitivity of the Lick indices to these differences at low metallicity. We compare these results to thick disks measured in other systems and to predictions from thick-disk formation models.},

	Abstract = {In a Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM) cosmology, the Milky Way accretes satellites into the stellar disc. We use cosmological simulations to assess the frequency of near disc plane and higher inclination accretion events, and collisionless simulations of satellite mergers to quantify the final state of the accreted material and the effect on the thin disc.
On average, a Milky Way-sized galaxy has three subhaloes with vmax > 80kms-1 seven with vmax > 60kms-1 and 15 with vmax > 40kms-1 merge at redshift z >~ 1. Assuming isotropic accretion, a third of these merge at an impact angle θ < 20$\,^{\circ}$ and are dragged into the disc plane by dynamical friction. Their accreted stars and dark matter settle into a thick disc. The stellar thick disc qualitatively reproduces the observed thick disc at the solar neighbourhood, but is less massive by a factor ~2 - 10. The dark matter disc contributes ρDDISC = 0.25 - 1ρHALO at the solar position. Although not likely to be dynamically interesting, the dark disc has important implications for the direct detection of dark matter because of its low velocity with respect to the Earth.

Higher inclination encounters θ > 20$\,^{\circ}$ are twice as likely as low-inclination ones. These lead to structures that closely resemble the recently discovered inner and outer stellar haloes. They also do more damage to the Milky Way stellar disc creating a more pronounced flare, and warp; both long-lived and consistent with current observations. The most massive mergers (vmax >~ 80kms-1) heat the thin disc enough to produce a thick disc. These heated thin-disc stars are essential for obtaining a thick disc as massive as that seen in the Milky Way; they likely comprise some ~50-90 per cent of the thick disc stars. The Milky Way thin disc must reform from fresh gas after z = 1.

Only one in four of our sample Milky Way haloes experiences mergers massive and late enough to fully destroy the thin disc. We conclude that thick, thin and dark discs occur naturally within a ΛCDM cosmology.},

The models use the new opacities by Rogers and Iglesias (1991) and by Kurucz (1991) at low T. The consequent changes in the solar helium content, in the mixing length ratio and in the overshooting parameter are taken into account after careful calibrations. Important physical ingredients as the nuclear reaction rates and the neutrino loss rates have been updated. The ionization of the main heavy elements is calculated in details. Results of the models are given in a compact way at corresponding evolutionary stages in each model. In addition to the tables, we shortly present some general results on the tracks in the HR diagrams, the lifetimes in the H-, He-, C-burning phases, and on massive and WR stars.},

	Abstract = {This article compares the distribution of Ks magnitudes of Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars obtained from the DENIS and 2MASS data with theoretical distributions. These have been constructed using up-to-date stellar evolution calculations for low and intermediate-mass stars, and in particular for thermally pulsing AGB stars. A fit of the magnitude distribution of both carbon- and oxygen-rich AGB stars allowed us to constrain the metallicity distribution across the LMC and its star formation rate (SFR). The LMC stellar population is found to be on average 5-6 Gyr old and is consistent with a mean metallicity corresponding to Z=0.006. These values may however be affected by systematic errors in the underlying stellar models, and by the limited exploration of the possible SFR histories. Instead our method should be particularly useful for detecting variations in the mean metallicity and SFR across the LMC disk. There are well defined regions where both the metallicity and the mean-age of the underlying stellar population span the whole range of grid parameters. The C/M ratio discussed in Paper I is a tracer of the metallicity distribution if the underlying stellar population is older than about a few Gyr. A similar study across the Small Magellanic Cloud is given in Paper III of this series.},

	Abstract = {This paper provides improved numerical relations between effective temperatures of stars, their B - V colors, and their bolometric corrections (B Cs) for the purpose of comparing theoretical stellar evolutionary calculations to color-magnitude diagrams of star clusters. Temperatures and bolometric correction measurements for 335 stars from the literature form the observational basis for the transformations. Measured temperatures range from 2900 to 52,500 K. Polynomial fits to the observations give relations between effective temperatures and B - V colors and between temperatures and bolometric corrections. Hot supergiants appear to have a Teff : B - V relation slightly different from those of main-sequence stars, subgiants, and giants. All luminosity classes appear to follow a unique Teff : BC relation. The Te BC relation for stars with temperatures less than 5000 K, however, is uncertain because temperatures of the coolest stars are determined from uncertain angular diameters.

	Abstract = {Many proto-planetary nebulae (PPNs) appear as narrow collimated structures sometimes showing multiple, roughly aligned lobes. In addition, many PPN flows have been shown to have short acceleration times. In this paper we explore whether jet or ``bullet'' (a massive clump) models fit the observations of individual collimated lobes adequately by comparing simulations of both radiatively cooled (stable) jets and bullets. We find that the clump model is favored over jets because (1) it leads to greater collimation of outflows, (2) it accounts better and more naturally for ringlike structures observed in the PPN CRL 618, and (3) it is more successful in reproducing the Hubble-flow character of observed kinematics in some PPNs. In addition, bullets naturally account for observed multipolar flows, since the likely MHD launch mechanisms required to drive outflows make multiple nonaligned jets unlikely. We also find that the bow shock heads of bullets take on a V-shaped configuration, whereas bow shock heads of jets are more U-shaped. The differences in these configurations occur on a linear scale corresponding to an angular size of the order of ~3"-sufficiently large to suggest a viable means of distinguishing bullets from jets in observations. We argue that PPN outflows may be driven by explosive MHD launch mechanisms such as those discussed in the context of supernovae (SNe) and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs).},

	Abstract = {The paper presents a complete list of averaged recalibrated absolute H-beta fluxes, global (where possible) relative He II lambda 4686 fluxes, 5 GHz radio flux densities, and H-alpha/H-beta interstellar extinction constants for 778 Galactic planetary nebulae. The catalog provides much of the fundamental data required to generate Zanstra temperatures. When data with the lowest errors are selected, the optical and radio/optical extinctions show a peculiar correlation, with the radio values slightly high at low extinction and notably low at high extinction. The data are used, along with the best estimates of angular diameters, to calculate Shklovsky distances according to the Daub scheme on the scale used earlier by Cahn and Kaler (1971). Use of this distance scale shows approximate equality of the death rates of optically thick and optically thin planetary nebulae. The method gives the correct distances to the Magellanic Clouds.},

	Abstract = {We present the discovery of an inhomogenous, low surface brightness, extended disklike structure around the Andromeda galaxy (M31) based on a large kinematic survey of more than 2800 stars with the Keck DEIMOS multiobject spectrograph. The stellar structure spans radii from 15 kpc out to 40 kpc, with detections out to R 70 kpc. The constituent stars have velocities close to the expected velocity of circular orbits in the plane of the M31 disk and typically have a velocity dispersion of 30 km s-1. The color range on the upper red giant branch shows a large spread indicative of a population with a significant range of metallicity. The mean metallicity of the population, measured from Ca II equivalent widths, is [Fe/H]=-0.9+/-0.2. The morphology of the structure is irregular at large radii and shows a wealth of substructures that must be transitory in nature and are almost certainly tidal debris. The presence of these substructures indicates that the global entity was formed by accretion. This extended disk follows smoothly on from the central parts of M31 disk out to 40 kpc with an exponential density law with a scale length of 5.1+/-0.1 kpc, which is similar to that of the bright inner disk. However, the population possesses similar kinematic and abundance properties over the entire region where it is detected in the survey. We estimate that the structure accounts for approximately 10% of the total luminosity of the M31 disk, and given the huge scale, contains 30% of the total disk angular momentum. This finding indicates that at least some galactic stellar disks are vastly larger than previously thought and are formed, at least in their outer regions, primarily by accretion.},

	Abstract = {The stellar wind from a red giant produces an extensive cool circumstellar nebula of appreciable mass. It is suggested that in some cases mass loss continues until the hot core of the star is exposed and that the stellar wind from the remnant star collides with the circumstellar nebula, producing a relatively dense shell of gas which increases in mass and radius at a constant rate. It is shown that such a shell, when ionized by radiation from the central star, has the characteristics of a planetary nebula. V1016 Cygni is used as an example of a star which has recently undergone the transition from a red giant to a young low-mass planetary nebula.},

	Abstract = {We present, using a novel technique, a study of the angular distribution of satellite galaxies around a sample of isolated, blue host galaxies selected from the sixth data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. As a complement to previous studies we subdivide the sample of galaxies into bins of differing inclination and use the systematic differences that would exist between the different bins as the basis for our approach. We parameterize the cumulative distribution function of satellite galaxies and apply a maximum likelihood, Monte-Carlo technique to determine allowable distributions, which we show as an exclusion plot. We find that the allowed distributions of the satellites of spiral hosts are very nearly isotropic. We outline our formalism and our analysis and discuss how this technique may be refined for future studies and future surveys.},

	Abstract = {In the past decade, surveys of the stellar component of the Galaxy have revealed a number of streams from tidally disrupted dwarf galaxies and globular clusters. Simulations of hierarchical structure formation in LCDM cosmologies predict that the dark matter halo of a galaxy like the Milky Way contains hundreds of subhalos with masses of ~10^8 solar masses and greater, and it has been suggested that the existence of coherent tidal streams is incompatible with the expected abundance of substructure. We investigate the effects of dark matter substructure on tidal streams by simulating the disruption of a self-gravitating satellite on a wide range of orbits in different host models both with and without substructure. We find that the halo shape and the specific orbital path more strongly determine the overall degree of disruption of the satellite than does the presence or absence of substructure, i.e., the changes in the large-scale properties of the tidal debris due to substructure are small compared to variations in the debris from different orbits in a smooth potential. Substructure typically leads to an increase in the degree of clumpiness of the tidal debris in sky projection, and in some cases a more compact distribution in line-of-sight velocity. Substructure also leads to differences in the location of sections of debris compared to the results of the smooth halo model, which may have important implications for the interpretation of observed tidal streams. A unique signature of the presence of substructure in the halo which may be detectable by upcoming surveys is identified. We conclude, however, that predicted levels of substructure are consistent with a detection of a coherent tidal stream from a dwarf galaxy.},

	Abstract = {The formation of galactic disks and the efficiency of star formation within them are issues central to our understanding of galaxy formation. We have developed a detailed and versatile model of disk formation which combines the strengths of previous studies of isolated disks with those of hierarchical galaxy formation models. Disk structure is inferred from the distribution of angular momentum in hot halo gas and the hierarchical build-up of dark matter, leading to theoretically generated systems where the evolution of surface density, rotation, velocity dispersion, stability and metallicity is predicted for annular regions on scales of 20-100pc. The model will be used to establish whether the accepted theory of large scale structure formation in the Universe is consistent with observed trends in the properties of disk galaxies. This first paper explicitly examines the importance of embedding such calculations within a merging hierarchy of dark matter halos, finding that this leads to dramatically different formation histories compared to models in which disks grow in isolation. Different models of star formation are explored, and are found to have only a secondary influence on the properties of the resulting galaxy disks, the main governing factor being the infalling gas supply from the hot halo.},

	Abstract = {We uncover the origin of the puzzling anti-correlation between the formation epoch of galactic dark-matter haloes and their environment density. This correlation has been revealed from cosmological N-body simulations and it is in conflict with the simple excursion-set model of halo clustering. Using similar simulations, we first quantify the straightforward association of an early formation epoch with a reduced mass growth rate at late times. We then find that the primary driver of suppressed growth, by accretion or mergers, is tidal effects dominated by a neighbouring massive halo. The tidal effects range from a slowdown of the assembly of haloes due to the shear along the large-scale filaments that feed the massive halo to actual mass loss in haloes that pass through the massive halo. Our results suggest that the dependence of formation epoch on environment density is a secondary effect induced by the enhanced density of haloes in filaments near massive haloes where the tides are strong. Our measures of assembly rate are particularly correlated with the tidal field at high redshifts z~1.},

@article{Tinker:2008a,
	Abstract = {We measure the mass function of dark matter halos in a large set of collisionless cosmological simulations of flat LCDM cosmology and investigate its evolution at z<~2. Halos are identified as isolated density peaks, and their masses are measured within a series of radii enclosing specific overdensities. We argue that these spherical overdensity masses are more directly linked to cluster observables than masses measured using the friends-of-friends algorithm (FOF), and are therefore preferable for accurate forecasts of halo abundances. Our simulation set allows us to calibrate the mass function at z=0 for virial masses in the range 10^{11} Msol/h < M < 10^{15} Msol/h, to <~ 5%. We derive fitting functions for the halo mass function in this mass range for a wide range of overdensities, both at z=0 and earlier epochs. In addition to these formulae, which improve on previous approximations by 10-20%, our main finding is that the mass function cannot be represented by a universal fitting function at this level of accuracy. The amplitude of the "universal" function decreases monotonically by ~20-50%, depending on the mass definition, from z=0 to 2.5. We also find evidence for redshift evolution in the overall shape of the mass function.},

@article{Gilmore:2008,
	Abstract = {There has been a vast recent improvement in photometric and kinematic data for star clusters, Ultra Compact dwarfs, galactic nuclei, and local dSph galaxies, with Subaru contributing substantially to the photometric studies in particular. These data show that there is a bimodal distribution in half-light radii, with stable star clusters always being smaller than 35pc, while stable galaxies are always larger than 120pc. We extend the previously known observational relationships and interpret them in terms of a more fundamental pair of intrinsic properties of dark matter itself: dark matter forms cored mass distributions, with a core scale length of greater than about 100pc, and always has a maximum central mass density with a narrow range. The dark matter in dSph galaxies appears to be clustered such that there is a mean volume mass density within the stellar distribution which has the very low value of about 0.1$M_{\odot}$ pc$^{-3}$. None of the dSphs displays kinematics which require the presence of an inner cusp, while in two dSphs there is evidence that the density profile is shallow (cored) in the inner regions. The maximum central dark matter density derived is model dependent, but is likely to have a mean value (averaged over a volume of radius 10pc) of about 0.1$M_{\odot}$ pc$^{-3}$, which is 5GeV/c$^2$cm$^{-3}$). Galaxies are embedded in dark matter halos with these properties; smaller systems containing dark matter are not observed.},

	Abstract = {It is proposed that for spiral galaxies there is a good correlation between the global neutral hydrogen line profile width, a distance-independent observable, and the absolute magnitude (or diameter). Such a relation is first sought in nearby calibration galaxies of the Local Group, the M 81 group, and the M 101 group, with well-determined distances, accurately known photometric properties, and accurately known global hydrogen profile width. On the basis of these calibration magnitude-global profile width and diameter-global profile width relationships, distances were derived for the Virgo cluster and the Ursa Major cluster. The distance moduli obtained are 30.6 m for the Virgo cluster and 30.5 m for the Ursa Major cluster. The result for the Virgo cluster suggests a Hubble constant of 80 km per sec per Mpc.},

@article{Dressler:1987,
	Abstract = {It has recently been found (Dressler et al., 1987) that a new photometric parameter, Dn, correlates well with central velocity dispersion for a sample of elliptical galaxies in clusters. Here it is shown that this correlation extends, perhaps equally well, to the bulges of early-type galaxies with Hubble types S0 to Sb. With the data available at present for S0 and spiral galaxies in the coma and Virgo clusters, the slopes and zero points of the log Dn-log sigma relationships are identical to those for the elliptical galaxies in the two clusters. In contrast to earlier work using the Faber-Jackson relation, these data show that the inner structures of bulges and ellipticals are very similar, which suggests that their origins were the same. The Dn-sigma relationship provides a simple and accurate estimator of relative distance. An absolute calibration is possible if the method can be applied to galaxies for which distances have been determined with primary indicators like Cepheid variables (e.g., M31 and M81). Using these data, the Dn-sigma relation gives a Hubble constant of 67 + or - 10 km/s Mpc.},

	Abstract = {Spectrophotometric observations of emission line intensities over the spectral range 1400 A to 9600 A were made in five positions in the planetary nebula NGC 3242. In two of the positions, both the weakness of the 1548 A, 1550 A C IV resonance lines and the steepness of the Balmer decrement suggest the possibility of internal dust in the nebula. The measured electron temperature varies little from the average value of 11,100 K, which is in reasonably good agreement with the less accurate value of 12,900 K measured from the Balmer continuum. The 4267 A C II line implies a C(2+) abundance that is much higher than that determined from the 1906 A, 1908 A C III lines. This discrepancy decreases with increasing distance from the central star. Equations used to correct for the existence of elements in other than the optically-observable ionization stages give results that are consistent and in agreement with abundances calculated using ultraviolet lines. This discrepancy decreases with increasing distance from the central star. Equations used to correct for the existence of elements in other than the optically-observable ionization stages give results that are consistent and in agreement with abundances calculated using ultraviolet lines. The logarithmic abundances are He = 10.96, O = 8.64, N = 7.96, Ne = 8.04, C = 8.41, Ar = 6.15, and S = 6.51.},

	Abstract = {Planetary nebulae (PNs) have highly articulated structures, called 'microstructures', little of which has been explored with spectrophotometry at high spatial resolution. We report spectrophotometric observations of microstructures characterized by both high SNR and high spatial resolution along the symmetry axes of NGC 3242, NGC 7662, and IC 2149. Of particular interest in these PNs are pairs of low-ionization and/or high-velocity ansae and jets (fast, low-ionization emission regions (FLIERs) on nearly opposite sides of their respective central stars, or nuclei. We present deep optical spectra of FLIERs in all three PNs and discuss their consequences. The strong low-ionization lines of O, N(+), O(+), and S(+), substantial space velocities, and temperatures and densities of FLIERs are not well explained either by models of edge-on ionization fronts or by models built on analogies to shock-excited Herbig-Haro objects.},

	Abstract = {Realistic ab-initio 3D, radiative-hydrodynamical convection simulations of the solar granulation have been applied to Fe i and Fe ii line formation. In contrast to classical analyses based on hydrostatic 1D model atmospheres the procedure contains no adjustable free parameters but the treatment of the numerical viscosity in the construction of the 3D, time-dependent, inhomogeneous model atmosphere and the elemental abundance in the 3D spectral synthesis. However, the numerical viscosity is introduced purely for numerical stability purposes and is determined from standard hydrodynamical test cases with no adjustments allowed to improve the agreement with the observational constraints from the solar granulation. The non-thermal line broadening is mainly provided by the Doppler shifts arising from the convective flows in the solar photosphere and the solar oscillations. The almost perfect agreement between the predicted temporally and spatially averaged line profiles for weak Fe lines with the observed profiles and the absence of trends in derived abundances with line strengths, seem to imply that the micro- and macroturbulence concepts are obsolete in these 3D analyses. Furthermore, the theoretical line asymmetries and shifts show a very satisfactory agreement with observations with an accuracy of typically 50-100 m s-1 on an absolute velocity scale. The remaining minor discrepancies point to how the convection simulations can be refined further.},

Separation of the nebular emission and the emission from the central star is described in detail, and the resultant UV fluxes from the central stars are presented for stars of various spectral types, including 10 O stars, two continuum stars, three Wolf-Rayet stars, three O VI stars, four Abell objects, and three unclassified central stars. It is shown that the central stars often do not radiate as blackbodies over the spectral range from 1550 to 5500 A. Zanstra temperatures are determined for the central stars, effective temperatures are derived from total fluxes, and a criterion is formulated for distinguishing optically thick and optically thin planetaries. The radii of the central stars and their positions on the H-R diagram are briefly examined.},

	Abstract = {A method is developed for determining the color temperature of the ionizing continuum of the central star photoionizing a surrounding nebula. The basis of this method rests on the assumption that energy balance holds in the photoionized nebula. This method is a generalization of Stoy's first derivation (1933) to several possible situations in actual nebulae, including the optically thin, partially thick, and completely optically thick nebulae. An analytical expression is obtained for the energy balance temperature of the central stars of low excitation nebulae. The energy balance temperature for 51 planetary nebulae are derived and the results are shown to be fairly insensitive to the optical depth of the surrounding nebula. A good consistency is obtained between the computed energy balance temperatures and the Zanstra temperatures. These findings are employed to predict the apparent visual magnitude of central stars not yet observed or only marginally detected.},

	Abstract = {We survey the results of those model calculations of the early evolution of single stars that have been obtained over approximately the last decade, and compare some of these results with the observations, concentrating particularly on the comparison between theoretical predictions regarding surface abundances of red giants and Cepheids and abundance estimates obtained by an analysis of spectral data.

For massive stars, we discuss the ramifications of the fact that the time scale for mass loss (via stellar winds) during main sequence and red supergiant evolution can be comparable to the nuclear burning timescale, noting in particular the unusual distribution of stars in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, and the probability that significant mass loss is responsible for the chemically highly evolved spectra of Wolf-Rayet stars. finally, we sketch (1) recent progresses in following the evolution of massive stars to the presupernova stage, which is described by a configuration consisting of a core of near-Chandrasekhar mass made up of iron peak elements and a series of ``onion''-skin layers of less highly thermonuclearly processed matter and (2) recent progress in understanding the nature of the type II supernova phenomenon.

For low and intermediate mass stars, we discuss postulated ``extramixing'' (beyond convective) processes, which may occur on the main sequence and on the first red giant branch, and continue on to a discussion of asymptotic giant branch evolution, placing considerable emphasis on the character of the thermal pulses that occur in such stars and, in particular, on the nucleosynthesis that occurs in the helium burning convective shells during these pulses and on the dredge-up phenomenon that brings fresh carbon and neutron-rich isotopes to the surface following pulse peak.},

	Abstract = {The evolution of the surface abundances of He-4, C-12, C-13, N-14, and O-16, in intermediate-mass stars (1-8 solar masses) have been computed from the main-sequence phase, till the ejection of the envelope (planetary-nebula ejection), or until the carbon ignition in the core. Two processes affecting the surface composition have been taken into account, namely: (1) convective dredge-ups, and (2) nuclear burning in the deepest layers of the convective envelope. Mass loss due to the stellar wind in the red-giant phase, and the envelope ejection leading to the formation of planetary nebulae have been also taken into account. In this way, several individual and collective properties of carbon stars are predicted, as well as the expected compositions of planetary nebulae, and the contribution of intermediate-mass stars to the galactic nucleosynthesis of the nuclides listed above. The primary production of C-13 and N-14 is also treated. A preliminary comparison with the observations shows that the present theory is able to account for several characteristics of carbon stars in the Galaxy, as well as in the Magellanic Clouds, and in the dwarf elliptical galaxy in Fornax. The theory accounts also for the observed range of helium abundances in planetary nebulae.},

	Abstract = {Over the past three decades the established view of a nearly homogeneuous, featureless Universe on scales larger than a few Megaparsec has been completely overhauled. In particular through the advent of ever larger galaxy redshift surveys we were revealed a galaxy distribution displaying an intriguing cellular pattern in which filamentary and wall-like structures, as well as huge regions devoid of galaxies, are amongst the most conspicuous morphological elements. In this contribution we will provide an overview of the present observational state of affairs concerning the distribution of galaxies and the structure traced out by the matter distribution in our Universe. In conjunction with the insight on the dynamics of the structure formation process obtained through the mapping of the peculiar velocities of galaxies in our local Universe and the information on the embryonic circumstances that prevailed at the epoch of recombination yielded by the various Cosmic Microwave Background experiments, we seek to arrive at a more or less compelling theoretical framework of structure formation. The main aspects of this framework of the rise of structure through gravitational instability can probably be most readily appreciated through illustrative examples of various scenarios, as for instance provided by some current state-of-the-art N-body simulations. We will subsequently wrap up the observational and theoretical evidence for the emergence and evolution of structure in the Universe by sketching the stage for the ultimate Holy Grail of late 20th century astrophysics, understanding the saga of the formation of what are arguably the most prominent and at the same time intoxicatingly beautiful and intriguing denizens of our Cosmos, the galaxies.},

	Abstract = {The current status of modeling the evolution and nucleosynthesis of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars is reviewed. The principles of AGB evolution have been investigated in recent years leading to improved and refined models, for example with regard to hot-bottom burning or the third dredge-up. The postprocessing s-process model yields quantitative results that reproduce many observations. However, these and most other processes in AGB stars are intimately related to the physics of stellar mixing. Mixing in AGB stars is currently not well-enough understood for accurate yield predictions. Several constraints and methods are available to improve the models. Some regimes of AGB evolution have not yet been studied in sufficient detail. These include the super-AGB stars and AGB stars at extremely low or ultra low metallicity.},

A hydrodynamic mechanism that collimates the gas as it passes outward through a prolate shock front is proposed to explain these observations. The usual fast-wind model is modified under the assumption that the slow-wind envelope that surrounds the star is denser near its equator than near the poles. In the present model, the collimated flow consists of a two-phase gas of cool weakly ionized or neutral knots passing through the surrounding highly ionized material.},

	Abstract = {Slit spectra and existing 'velocity cube' data have been used to determine the structure of the double ring PN NGC 2392. The inner shell is a stellar wind-sculpted prolate spheroid with a ratio of axes of 2:1 and the approaching end of the long axis pointed 20 deg from the line of sight in P.A. = 200 deg. The outer ring is caused by an outer disk with density dropping off with distance from the central star and with distance from its plane, which is the same as the equatorial band of high density in the inner shell. The outer disk contains a ring of higher density knots at a distance of 16 arcsec and is losing material through free expansion, forming an outer envelope of increasing velocity. Forbidden S II spectra are used to determine the densities in all of the major regions of the nebula. It is argued that the filamentary cores at the centers of the knots seen in the outer ring originate in the sublimation of bodies formed at the same time as the parent star.},

	Abstract = {I present sensitive high-resolution VLA B, C, and D array observations of the almost edge-on Scd galaxy NGC 4244 in the 21 -cm spectral line of neutral atomic hydrogen. The gas layer of NGC 4244 is rather symmetric in all respects, i.e. the surface density distribution, flaring and warping. This symmetry allows for a reliable determination of the rotation curve, despite the fact that the galaxy is close to edge-on. The rotation curve rises slowly in the inner 6 kpc, is roughly constant at 100 km s^-1^ out to 10 kpc, and decreases in Keplerian fashion by 15% at the last measured point at 14 kpc. The rotation curve constrains the stellar mass-to-light ratio to lie between 50% and 100% of the "maximum-disk" value. A new technique is presented to determine simultaneously the inclination and the thickness of the gas layer from high-resolution H I observations. This procedure uses the apparent widths at many azimuths (many channels) and can be used at inclinations as low as 60^deg^. Kinematic information is used to separate flaring from warping. The inclination of the unwarped disk is about 84.5, while the small warp coincides with a decreasing inclination (to 82.5^deg^+/-1^deg^). The data indicate that at large radii the disk warps back to the plane defined by the inner disk. The measured gaseous velocity dispersion is roughly constant within the optical disk (8.5 +/- 1 km s^-1^) and increases slightly beyond. On both sides of the galaxy the thickness of the gas layer increases gradually from ~400 pc at 5 kpc to ~1.5 kpc at the last measured point (at 13 kpc). The strong gradients in the inferred thickness which bracket the spiral arms probably result from streaming motions associated with the arms and are not intrinsic to the galaxy. In an accompanying paper (AJ, 1996,) I use the measurements presented in this paper to infer that the dark matter halo of NGC 4244 is highly flattened.},

	Abstract = {Results are given of observations of the UV spectra of several H II regions in the Magellanic Clouds, with emphasis on obtaining the carbon abundance from the UV lines of C II, C III, and C IV. The observations and results are described, and theoretical model calculations are presented of the H II regions and the relative abundances of H, He, C, N, O, S, Cl, and Ar computed from the UV and visual spectra. In addition, the abundance results for the Magellanic Clouds are compared with the sun, the Orion Nebula, and galactic planetary nebulae. In comparison with solar abundances, carbon is found to be depleted relative to hydrogen in the Magellanic Clouds by an amount larger than that of nitrogen and oxygen in the SMC and by an amount between that of nitrogen and oxygen in the LMC. It is noted that the results are consistent with a scenario that nitrogen and oxygen have greater primary yields in massive stars than carbon, which may be produced predominantly in less massive stars (such that C/N and C/O in galaxies are initially very low and subsequently increase with evolution). Subsequently, the C/N ratio may decrease as secondary production of nitrogen in less massive stars becomes significant.},

	Abstract = {This paper is the fourth and final report on a project designed to study carbon abundances in a sample of planetary nebulae representing a broad range in progenitor mass and metallicity. We present newly acquired optical spectrophotometric data for three Galactic planetary nebulae, IC 418, NGC 2392, and NGC 3242, and combine them with UV data from the IUE Final Archive for identical positions in each nebula to determine accurate abundances of He, C, N, O, and Ne at one or more locations in each object. We then collect abundances of these elements for the entire sample and compare them with theoretical predictions of planetary nebula abundances from a grid of intermediate-mass star models. We find some consistency between observations and theory, lending modest support to our current understanding of nucleosynthesis in stars below 8Msolar in birth mass. Overall, we believe that observed abundances agree with theoretical predictions to well within an order of magnitude but probably not better than to within a factor of 2 or 3. However, even this level of consistency between observation and theory enhances the validity of published intermediate-mass stellar yields of carbon and nitrogen in the study of the abundance evolution of these elements.},

	Abstract = {
We propose to continue our highly successful GHOSTS WFC/ACS survey of the resolved
stellar populations of nearby, massive disk galaxies. These observations provide star 
counts and color-magnitude diagrams 2-3 magnitudes below the tip of the Red Giant 
Branch of the outer disk and halo of each galaxy. We will measure the metallicity 
distribution functions and stellar density profiles from star counts down to very low 
average surface brightnesses, equivalent to ~32 V-mag per square arcsec. 
 
This proposal will substantially improve our unique sampling of galaxy outskirts. Our 
targets cover a range in galaxy mass, luminosity, inclination, and morphology. As 
function of these galaxy properties this survey provides: 
  - the first systematic measurement of radial light profiles and axial ratios 
    of the diffuse stellar halos and outer disks of spiral galaxies 
  - a comprehensive analysis of halo metallicity distributions as function of 
    galaxy type and position within the galaxy 
  - an unprecedented study of the stellar metallicity and age distribution in 
    the outer disk regions where the disk truncations occur 
  - the first comparative study of globular clusters and their field stellar populations 
 
We will use these fossil records of the galaxy assembly process to test halo 
formation models within the hierarchical galaxy formation scheme.},

	Abstract = {
The evolution of galaxies results from a combination of internal and
external processes. The star formation is an internal process
transforming cold and dense cores of molecular clouds to stars. It may
be triggered internally by expanding shells, or externally, e. g. by
galaxy collisions. The gas accretion and galaxy merging events are
external contributors to galaxy evolution. They compete with another
internal process of galaxy evolution, which is the secular evolution
redistributing the mass and angular momentum inside of galaxies as a
consequence of bar and spiral arms formation. As a nearby example of gas
accretion we mention the interacting system Milky Way - Large and Small
Magellanic Clouds. Stripping of ISM in galaxy clusters is reviewed as
another example of interaction of galaxies with their environment.

@article{de-Jong:2007,
	Abstract = {We use HST/ACS to study the resolved stellar populations of the nearby, nearly edge-on galaxy NGC4244 across its outer disk surface density break. The stellar photometry allows us to study the distribution of different stellar populations and reach very low equivalent surface brightnesses. We find that the break occurs at the same radius for young, intermediate age, and old stars. The stellar density beyond the break drops sharply by a factor of at least 600 in 5 kpc. The break occurs at the same radius independent of height above the disk, but is sharpest in the midplane and nearly disappears at large heights. These results make it unlikely that truncations are caused by a star formation threshold alone: the threshold would have to keep the same radial position from less than 100 Myr to 10 Gyr ago, in spite of potential disturbances such as infall and redistribution of gas by internal processes. A dynamical interpretation of truncation formation is more likely such as due to angular momentum redistribution by bars or density waves, or heating and stripping of stars caused by the bombardment of dark matter sub-halos. The latter explanation is also in quantitative agreement with the small diffuse component we see around the galaxy.},

	Abstract = {
We present a deep photometric survey of the Andromeda galaxy, conducted
with the wide-field cameras of CFHT and INT, that covers the inner 50
kpc of the galaxy and the southern quadrant out to ~150 kpc and includes
an extension to M33 at &gt;200 kpc. This is the first systematic
panoramic study of this very outermost region of galaxies. We detect a
multitude of large-scale structures of low surface brightness, including
several streams, and two new relatively luminous (M<SUB>V</SUB>~-9)
dwarf galaxies: And XV and And XVI. Significant variations in stellar
populations due to intervening stream-like structures are detected in
the inner halo, which is particularly important in shedding light on the
mixed and sometimes conflicting results reported in previous studies.
Underlying the many substructures lies a faint, smooth, and extremely
extended halo component, reaching out to 150 kpc, whose stellar
populations are predominantly metal-poor. We find that the smooth halo
component in M31 has a radially decreasing profile that can be fitted
with a Hernquist model of immense scale radius ~55 kpc, almost 4 times
larger than theoretical predictions. Alternatively a power law with
Sigma<SUB>V</SUB>~R<SUP>-1.91+/-0.11</SUP> can be fitted to the
projected profile, similar to the density profile in the Milky Way. If
it is symmetric, the total luminosity of this structure is
~10<SUP>9</SUP> L<SUB>solar</SUB>, again similar to the stellar halo of
the Milky Way. This vast, smooth, underlying halo is reminiscent of a
classical ``monolithic'' model and completely unexpected from modern
galaxy formation models. M33 is also found to have an extended
metal-poor halo component, which can be fitted with a Hernquist model
also of scale radius ~55 kpc. These extended slowly decreasing halos
will provide a challenge and strong constraints for further modeling.<p/>

Based on observations obtained with MegaPrime/MegaCam, a joint project
of CFHT and CEA/DAPNIA, at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT),
which is operated by the National Research Council (NRC) of Canada, the
Institute National des Sciences de l'Univers of the Centre National de
la Recherche Scientifique of France, and the University of Hawaii.

	Abstract = {We combine GALEX near-UV photometry with a volume-limited sample of local (0.005<z<0.037) SDSS DR4 galaxies to examine the composition and the environmental dependencies of the optical and UV-optical colour-magnitude (C-M) diagrams. We find that ~30% of red sequence galaxies in the optical C-M diagram show signs of ongoing star-formation from their spectra having EW(Halpha)>2A. This contamination is greatest at faint magnitudes (Mr>-19) and in field regions where as many as three-quarters of red sequence galaxies are star-forming, and as such has important consequences for following the build-up of the red sequence. We find that the NUV-r colour instead allows a much more robust separation of passively-evolving and star-forming galaxies, which allows the build-up of the UV-selected red sequence with redshift and environment to be directly interpreted in terms of the assembly of stellar mass in passively-evolving galaxies. We find that in isolated field regions the number density of UV-optical red sequence galaxies declines rapidly at magnitudes fainter than Mr~-19 and appears completely truncated at Mr~-18. This confirms the findings of Haines et al. (2007) that no passively-evolving dwarf galaxies are found more than two virial radii from a massive halo, whether that be a group, cluster or massive galaxy. These results support the downsizing paradigm whereby the red sequence is assembled from the top down, being already largely in place at the bright end by z~1, and the faint end filled in at later epochs in clusters and groups through environment-related processes such as ram-pressure stripping or galaxy harassment.},

	Abstract = {Within the cold dark matter (CDM) framework tidal dwarf galaxies (TDGs) cannot contain dark matter, so the recent results by Bournaud et al. (2007) that 3 rotating TDGs do show significant evidence for being dark matter dominated is inconsistent with the current concordance cosmological theory unless yet another dark matter component is postulated. We confirm that the TDG rotation curves are consistent with Newtonian dynamics only if either an additional dark matter component is postulated, or if all 3 TDGs happen to be viewed edge-on, which is unlikely given the geometry of the tidal debris. We also find that the observed rotation curves are very naturally explained without any free parameters within the modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) framework if inclinations are adopted as derived by Bournaud et al. We explore different inclination angles and two different assumptions about the external field effect. The results do not change significantly, and we conclude therefore that Newtonian dynamics has severe problems while MOND does exceedingly well in explaining the observed rotation curves of the 3 TDGs studied by Bournaud et al.},

	Abstract = {We present the first galaxy-galaxy weak lensing results using early data from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS). These results are based on ~22 sq. deg. of i' data. From this data, we estimate the average velocity dispersion for an L* galaxy at a redshift of 0.3 to be 137 +- 11 km/s, with a virial mass, M_{200}, of 1.1 +- 0.2 \times 10^{12} h^{-1} Msun and a rest frame R-band mass-to-light ratio of 173 +- 34 h Msun/Lsun. We also investigate various possible sources of systematic error in detail. Additionally, we separate our lens sample into two sub-samples, divided by apparent magnitude, thus average redshift. From this early data we do not detect significant evolution in galaxy dark matter halo mass-to-light ratios from a redshift of 0.45 to 0.27. Finally, we test for non-spherical galaxy dark matter halos. Our results favor a dark matter halo with an ellipticity of ~0.3 at the 2-sigma level when averaged over all galaxies. If the sample of foreground lens galaxies is selected to favor ellipticals, the mean halo ellipticity and significance of this result increase.},

	Abstract = {The main goal of this paper is to compare the relative importance of destruction by tides, vs. destruction by mergers, in order to assess if tidal destruction of dwarf galaxies in clusters is a viable scenario for explaining the origin of intracluster stars. We have designed a simple algorithm for simulating the evolution of isolated clusters. The distribution of galaxies in the cluster is evolved using a direct gravitational N-body algorithm combined with a subgrid treatment of physical processes such as mergers, tidal disruption, and galaxy harassment. Using this algorithm, we have performed a total of 227 simulations. Our main results are (1) destruction of dwarf galaxies by mergers dominates over destruction by tides, and (2) the destruction of dwarf galaxies by tides is sufficient to explain the observed intracluster light in clusters.},

	Abstract = {On megaparsec scales the Universe is permeated by an intricate filigree of clusters, filaments, sheets and voids, the Cosmic Web. For the understanding of its dynamical and hierarchical history it is crucial to identify objectively its complex morphological components. One of the most characteristic aspects is that of the dominant underdense Voids, the product of a hierarchical process driven by the collapse of minor voids in addition to the merging of large ones. In this study we present an objective void finder technique which involves a minimum of assumptions about the scale, structure and shape of voids. Our void finding method, the Watershed Void Finder (WVF), is based upon the Watershed Transform, a well-known technique for the segmentation of images. Importantly, the technique has the potential to trace the existing manifestations of a void hierarchy. The basic watershed transform is augmented by a variety of correction procedures to remove spurious structure resulting from sampling noise. This study contains a detailed description of the WVF. We demonstrate how it is able to trace and identify, relatively parameter free, voids and their surrounding (filamentary and planar) boundaries. We test the technique on a set of Kinematic Voronoi models, heuristic spatial models for a cellular distribution of matter. Comparison of the WVF segmentations of low noise and high noise Voronoi models with the quantitatively known spatial characteristics of the intrinsic Voronoi tessellation shows that the size and shape of the voids are succesfully retrieved. WVF manages to even reproduce the full void size distribution function.},

@article{Howk:1999,
	Abstract = {We present high-resolution (0.6" to ~1.0") BV images of 12 edge-on spiral galaxies observed with the WIYN 3.5 m telescope. These images were obtained to search for extraplanar (|z|>0.4 kpc) absorbing dust structures similar to those previously found in NGC 891 (Howk & Savage). Many of these galaxies have been previously searched for diffuse ionized gas at high z. Our imaged galaxies include a sample of seven massive L_*-like spiral galaxies within D<~25 Mpc that have inclinations i>~87^deg from the plane of the sky. We find that five of these seven systems show extraplanar dust, visible as highly structured absorbing clouds against the background stellar light of the galaxies. These dust structures lie at heights |z|>~0.4 kpc, which should be above most of the thin disk molecular material in these galaxies. The more prominent structures are estimated to have associated gas masses >~10^5 M_solar the implied potential energies are >~10^52 ergs. All of the galaxies in our sample that show detectable Halpha emission at large z also show extraplanar dust structures. None of those galaxies for which extraplanar Halpha searches were negative show evidence for extensive high-z dust. The existence of extraplanar dust is a common property of massive spiral galaxies. We discuss several mechanisms for shaping the observed dust features. We emphasize in this discussion the possibility that these dusty clouds represent the dense phase of a multiphase medium at high z in spiral galaxies. In a few cases interactions with close galaxy companions could be responsible for the high-z dust, either through dynamical stripping or triggered star formation. We can rule out warps as the source of the observed high-z dust. Flaring gas layers seem an unlikely source of the observed material but cannot be ruled out at this time, except for those features that clearly connect to energetic processes in the disk. The correlation between high-z dust and extraplanar Halpha emission may simply suggest that both trace the high-z interstellar medium in its various forms (or phases), the existence of which may ultimately be driven by vigorous star formation in the underlying disk. The absorption produced by high-z dust and associated gas in spiral galaxies must be accounted for when studying extraplanar emission from spiral galaxies over much of the electromagnetic spectrum.},

	Abstract = {We explore the nature of variations in dust emission within an individual galaxy using 3.6 - 160 micron Spitzer Space Telescope observations and 450 and 850 micron James Clerk Maxwell Telescope observations of the edge-on Sd spiral galaxy NGC 4631 with the goals of understanding the relation between polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and dust emission, studying the variations in the colors of the dust emission, and searching for possible excess submillimeter emission compared to what is anticipated based on dust models applied to the mid- and far-infrared data. PAH emission at 8 micron is found to correlate best with hot dust emission at 24 micron on kiloparsec scales, although the relation breaks down on scales equal to hundreds of parsecs, possibly because of differences in the mean free paths between the photons that excite the PAHs and heat the dust and possibly because the PAHs are destroyed by the hard radiation fields in the centers of some star formation regions. The ratio of 8 micron PAH emission to 160 micron cool dust emission appears to be a function of radius. The 70/160 and 160/450 micron flux density ratios are remarkably constant even though the surface brightness varies by a factor of 25 in each wave band, which suggests that the emission is from dust heated by a nearly-uniform radiation field. Globally, we find an excess of 850 micron emission relative to what would be predicted by dust models. The 850 micron excess is highest in regions with low 160 micron surface brightness, although the strength and statistical significance of this result depends on the model fit to the data. We rule out variable emissivity functions or ~4 K dust as the possible origins of this 850 micron emission, but we do discuss the other possible mechanisms that could produce the emission.},

	Abstract = {We present WSRT observations of 21-cm line emission from the disturbed, edge-on galaxy NGC 4631. Maps at resolutions 12"x22", 35", and 45"x89" are presented, and these are used in conjunction with position-velocity cuts through the various data cubes in order to understand the structure of the disk and the many tidal spurs which protrude from this interacting galaxy. We also study the two companions NGC 4656 and NGC 4627, and three dwarfs in the system with H I detections. We first attempt to get a rough idea of the structure of the disk of NGC 4631. The data can be well modelled by a differentially rotating disk with a steep fall-off beyond 4 kpc, and an outer disk restricted to the radius range 7-15 kpc. The latter component could simply be a set of spiral arms. Radial motions are probably present in the central few arcminutes. The inner disk bends upwards with increasing distance from the center on both the east and west sides. Strong tides may be responsible. The H I layer at high resolution shows many disturbances, a large extent parallel to the minor axis, and a ragged appearance along its edges. The velocity structure of the gas far from the major axis of NGC 4631 suggests that most of this emission is due to the galaxy being not quite edge-on, a rather large (500-1000 pc) scale-height in the outer galaxy, and the connection of one of the spurs with the disk. A few high latitude features with a probable inner disk origin are found, and these are more likely to be due to gas raised out of the plane by stellar winds and supernovae. However, outer galaxy star formation may contribute to the large H I scale-height there. No gas can be unambiguously associated with the dwarf elliptical companion, NGC 4627. It is difficult to identify any of the spurs as gas that once belonged to this galaxy (despite recent signs of star formation), as in the model of Combes. Modelling of the tidal encounters should now be redone, since more tidal debris has been discovered and an optical velocity of NGC 4627 has been determined. Position-velocity diagrams parallel to the major axis of the edge-on companion, NGC 4656, reveal a ring-like structure in the inner 15 kpc. Furthermore, the high and low-velocity sides of the ring arise from opposite sides of the midplane. Two possible explanations are given for this structure. First, NGC 4656 may consist primarily of two loosely wrapped tidal arms, viewed not quite edge-on. Second, NGC 4656 may be a ring galaxy similar to the Cartwheel. The south-west side of the disk shows many "worms" (or vertical filaments) with velocities consistent with an outer disk origin. The most prominent worm, however, is on the north-east side, above the center of the major axis. Its mass is ~3 x 10^7^Msun At very marginal signal-to-noise ratios, the worm bends around to form a complete loop.},

	Abstract = {
We study the nature and the origin of the dust arch in the halo of the
edge-on galaxy NGC 4631 detected by Neininger &#38; Dumke. We present CO
observations made using the new on-the-fly mapping mode with the Five
College Radio Astronomy Observatory 14 m telescope and find no evidence
for CO emission associated with the dust arch. Our examination of
previously published H I data shows that, if previous assumptions about
the dust temperature and gas/dust ratio are correct, then there must be
molecular gas associated with the arch, below our detection threshold.
If this is true, then the molecular mass associated with the dust arch
is between 1.5&#215;10<SUP>8</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB> and
9.7&#215;10<SUP>8</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB>, and likely toward the low
end of the range. A consequence of this is that the maximum allowed
value for the CO-to-H<SUB>2</SUB> conversion factor is 6.5 times the
Galactic value, but most likely closer to the Galactic value. The
kinematics of the H I apparently associated with the dust arch reveals
that the gas here is not part of an expanding shell or outflow but is
instead two separate features (a tidal arm and a plume of H I sticking
out into the halo) that are seen projected together and appear as a
shell. Thus there is no connection between the dust ``arch'' and the hot
X-ray-emitting gas that appears to surround the galaxy.

@article{Rand:1993,
	Abstract = {Using Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope maps of 21 cm emission from NGC 4631, we have discovered two very large supershells of atomic gas in the disk of this nearby, disturbed edge-on galaxy. The larger shell has a diameter of about 3 kpc and a swept up mass of roughly 1-2 x 10 exp 8 solar masses. There is some evidence for expansion, with a velocity of 45 km/s. Above a break at the top of the shell, there is a prominent 'worm' of mass about 4 x 10 exp 7 solar masses. The smaller shell has a diameter of 1.8 kpc and shows better evidence for expansion, at 35 km/s, and has a mass of about 5-10 x 10 exp 7 solar masses. The kinetic energy of the larger shell is roughly 2-5 x 10 exp 54 erg, and the necessary input energy from supernovae and stellar winds to explain its current parameters is 2-5 x 10 exp 55 erg, implying an association containing 10,000-35,000 supernova-producing OB stars. A more attractive explanation as far as energetics are concerned is that small companions or massive gas clouds hit the disk of the galaxy and formed the shells. Unfortunately, there is no clear independent evidence for such collisions, and the near-complete ringlike appearance of the shells may be a problem for this explanation.},

	Abstract = {The degree of clustering or disorder within earthquake distributions may be measured using the concept of entropy. A method for calculating the entropy of any 3-D point set (e.g. earthquake foci) is presented. This makes use of Voronoi cells (convex polyhedra representing nearest neighbour regions) to measure point density in three dimensions. An estimate of event density can be determined directly from the size of Voronoi cells. Normalizations are introduced to the definition of entropy that allow data sets containing different numbers of events and occupying different volumes to be compared quantitatively, for example, earthquake catalogues from different tectonic regimes. Our results show a clear correlation between earthquake entropy and tectonic regime. The most ordered are the mid-ocean ridges, followed by the subduction zones and finally intraplate seismicity. We show how entropy may be used to quantify the simplification of earthquake distributions, for example, due to relocation procedures. A recently published algorithm called the collapsing method is used as an example of a technique that reduces entropy while respecting data fit. Modifications to this method are made that reduce artefacts and use additional temporal information in the earthquake distribution. These methods are applied to a global catalogue of 85000 events, and a local catalogue from the SIL network in Iceland containing 43300 events. The entropy of both catalogues is reduced. Results from the Hengill region within the SIL network show lineations whose orientations agree with independent studies using relative location techniques and surface faulting.},

	Abstract = {This paper develops the multidimensional binary search tree (or k-d tree, where k is the dimensionality of the search space) as a data structure for storage of information to be retrieved by associative searches. The k-d tree is defined and examples are given. It is shown to be quite efficient in its storage requirements. A significant advantage of this structure is that a single data structure can handle many types of queries very efficiently. Various utility algorithms are developed; their proven average running times in an n record file are: insertion, O(log n); deletion of the root, O(n(k-1)/k); deletion of a random node, O(log n); and optimization (guarantees logarithmic performance of searches), O(n log n). Search algorithms are given for partial match queries with t keys specified [proven maximum running time of O(n(k-t)/k)] and for nearest neighbor queries [empirically observed average running time of O(log n).] These performances far surpass the best currently known algorithms for these tasks. An algorithm is presented to handle any general intersection query. The main focus of this paper is theoretical. It is felt, however, that k-d trees could be quite useful in many applications, and examples of potential uses are given.},

	Abstract = {Nearly seventy per cent of the energy density in the universe is unclustered and exerts negative pressure. This conclusion - now supported by numerous observations - poses the greatest challenge for theoretical physics today. I discuss this issue with special emphasis on the cosmological constant as the possible choice for the dark energy. Several curious features of a universe with a cosmological constant are described and some possible approaches to understand the nature of the cosmological constant are reviewed. In particular, I show how some of the recent ideas, related to a thermodynamic route to gravity, allow us to: (i) create a paradigm in which the bulk value of cosmological constant is irrelevant and (ii) obtain the correct, observed, value for the cosmological constant from vacuum fluctuations in a region confined by the deSitter horizon.},

	Abstract = {We discuss the possible origin of the radial truncations in stellar discs, using measurements that we presented in an earlier paper. A tentative correlation is found with the de-projected face-on central surface brightness; lower surface brightness discs tend to have a smaller truncation radius in units of scalelength. This and our earlier finding that in smaller spirals the truncation tends to occur at a larger number of scalelengths are best reproduced when the truncation is caused by a constant gas-density threshold on star formation.},

@article{Elmegreen:2006,
	Abstract = {Star formation in galaxies is triggered by a combination of processes, including gravitational instabilities, spiral wave shocks, stellar compression, and turbulence compression. Some of these persist in the far outer regions, where the column density is far below the threshold for instabilities, making the outer disk cutoff somewhat gradual. We show that in a galaxy with a single exponential gas profile the star formation rate can have a double exponential, with a shallow one in the inner part and a steep one in the outer part. Such double exponentials have been observed recently in the broadband intensity profiles of spiral and dwarf irregular galaxies. The break radius in our model occurs slightly outside the threshold for instabilities, provided the Mach number for compressive motions remains of order unity to large radii. The ratio of the break radius to the inner exponential scale length increases for higher surface brightness disks because the unstable part extends farther out. This is also in agreement with observations. Galaxies with extended outer gas disks that fall more slowly than a single exponential, such as 1/R, can have their star formation rate scale approximately as a single exponential with radius, even out to 10 disk scale lengths. Halpha profiles should drop much faster than the star formation rate as a result of the rapidly decreasing ambient density.},

	Abstract = {We present a cosmologically motivated model for the hierarchical formation of the stellar halo that includes a semianalytic treatment of galactic chemical enrichment coupled to numerical simulations that track the orbital evolution and tidal disruption of satellites. A major motivating factor in this investigation is the observed systematic difference between the chemical abundances of stars in satellite galaxies and those in the Milky Way halo. Specifically, for the same [Fe/H] values, stars in neighboring satellite galaxies display significantly lower [alpha/Fe] ratios than stars in the halo. We find that the observed chemical abundance patterns are a natural outcome of the process of hierarchical assembly of the Galaxy. This result follows because the stellar halo in this context is built up from satellite galaxies accreted early on (more than 8-9 Gyr ago) and enriched in alpha-elements produced in Type II supernovae. In contrast, satellites that still survive today are typically accreted late (within the last 4-5 Gyr) with nearly solar [alpha/Fe] values as a result of contributions from both Type II and Type Ia supernovae. We use our model to investigate the abundance distribution functions (using both [Fe/H] and [alpha/Fe] ratios) for stars in the halo and in surviving satellites. Our results suggest that the shapes and peaks in the abundance distribution functions provide a direct probe of the accretion histories of galaxies.},

	Abstract = {Using the Hubble Space Telescope, we have resolved individual red giant branch stars in the halos of eight nearby spiral galaxies. The fields lie at projected distances between 2 and 13 kpc along the galaxies' minor axes. The data set allows a first look at the systematic trends in halo stellar populations. We have found that bright galaxies tend to have broad red giant branch star color distributions with redder mean colors, suggesting that the heavy-element abundance spread increases with the parent galaxy luminosity. The mean metallicity of the stellar halo, estimated using the mean colors of red giant branch stars, correlates with the parent galaxy luminosity. The metallicity of the Milky Way halo falls nearly 1 dex below this luminosity-metallicity relation, suggesting that the halo of the Galaxy is more the exception than the rule for spiral galaxies; i.e., massive spirals with metal-poor halos are unusual. The luminosity-halo stellar abundance relation is consistent with the scaling relation expected for stellar systems embedded in dominant halos, suggesting that the bulk of the halo stellar population may have formed in situ.

	Abstract = {The extinction through a spiral galaxy's disk can be measured from the number of distant galaxies identified through this disk. To calibrate this number for crowding and confusion effects, Gonzalez et al. (1998) developed the ``Synthetic Field Method''. The method has been automated in order to apply it to a sample of 32 archival HST/WFPC2 images of 29 spirals. 
Radial opacity profiles from the combined counts are presented, averaged over the entire sample, per Hubble type and for arm and disk regions. The effects of inclination, dust clouds, Hubble type and the effects of spiral arms on the disk opacity are discussed. 
Extinction in a spiral galaxy extends at least to its optical radius and is constant for a large part of the disk. The relation between apparent opacity and inclination as well as the relation between opacity and the average color of the distant galaxies are both evidence of a clumpy distribution of the dust. 
The relation between dust and stellar light is also explored. The brighter parts of a spiral disk, the arms and the center, are more opaque than the rest of the disk. A relation between surface brightness and opacity can be seen, especially in the spiral arms. 
The radial profiles of dust opacity and surface density of atomic hydrogen gas are compared. On small scales there seems to be no relation between dust and gas. Averaged over many disks, there appears to be more dust per gas column than in previous measurements.
The opacity profiles and the profiles of emission characteristic for dust are compared. This comparison indicates that a large fraction of the dust responsible for the opacity of the spiral disk is very cold.
This method and its limitations are now very well characterized. The accuracy is shown to be directly related to the surface brightness and granularity of the field. The future application of counts of distant galaxies as a probe of extinction in a foreground disk are briefly presented.},

	Abstract = {The disk galaxy simulated using our chemodynamic galaxy formation code, GCD+, is shown to have a thick-disk component. This is evidenced by the velocity dispersion versus age relation for solar neighborhood stars, which clearly shows an abrupt increase in velocity dispersion at a look-back time of approximately 8 Gyr, and is in excellent agreement with observation. These thick-disk stars are formed from gas that is accreted to the galaxy during a chaotic period of hierarchical clustering at high redshift. This formation scenario is shown to be consistent with observations of both the Milky Way and extragalactic thick disks.},

	Abstract = {I briefly review the growing evidence that thick stellar disks surround most edge-on disk galaxies. Recent studies show that these extragalactic thick disks have old ages, low metallicities, long scale lengths, and moderately flattened axial ratios, much like the thick disk of the Milky Way. However, the properties of thick disks change systematically with the mass of the galaxy. The thick disks of low mass galaxies are more prominent and somewhat more metal-poor than those surrounding massive disk galaxies. Given the strong evidence that thick disks are fossils from an early epoch of merging, these trends place tight constraints on the early assembly of disk galaxies. The data suggest that the vast majority of the accretion onto the early disk was gaseous, but that the majority of thick disk stars were directly accreted.},

@article{Kroupa:2002,
	Abstract = {The building blocks of galaxies are star clusters. These form with low star formation efficiencies and, consequently, lose a large part of their stars that expand outwards once the residual gas is expelled by the action of the massive stars. Massive star clusters may thus add kinematically hot components to galactic field populations. This kinematical imprint on the stellar distribution function is estimated here by calculating the velocity distribution function for ensembles of star clusters distributed as power-law or log-normal initial cluster mass functions (ICMFs). The resulting stellar velocity distribution function is non-Gaussian and may be interpreted as being composed of multiple kinematical subpopulations. The velocity dispersion of solar-neighbourhood stars increases more rapidly with stellar age than theoretical calculations of orbital diffusion predict. Interpreting this difference to arise from star formation characterized by larger cluster masses, rather than as yet unknown stellar-dynamical heating mechanisms, suggests that the star formation rate in the Milky Way disc has been quietening down, or at least shifting towards less massive star-forming units. Thin-disc stars with ages may have formed from an ICMF extending to very rich Galactic clusters. Stars appear to be forming preferentially in modest embedded clusters during the past 3Gyr. Applying this approach to the ancient thick disc of the Milky Way, it follows that its large velocity dispersion may have been produced through a high star formation rate and thus an ICMF extending to massive embedded clusters (~105-6 Msolar ), even under the extreme assumption that early star formation occurred in a thin gas-rich disc. This enhanced star formation episode in an early thin Galactic disc could have been triggered by passing satellite galaxies, but direct satellite infall into the disc may not be required for disc heating.

	Abstract = {Aims. The extraplanar stellar populations of highly-inclined disk galaxies IC 2233, IC 5052, NGC 4631 and NGC 5023 are analyzed with the goal to quantify their vertical extent and structure. Methods. Based on the single-star photometry, we separate different stellar populations and analyze their spatial distribution. Results. On archival images obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope ACS/WFC the surroundings of these galaxies are well resolved into stars with the red giant population (RGB) identified far above the galaxy mid-planes. We find that there are a profound change in slope of the number density profile of the evolved RGB stars at extraplanar height of 4-8 kpc, that possibly reflects a truncation of the thick disk and reaching the 2-3 times more extended oblate stellar component (``the halo''). This structure is consistent with our previous studies of both edge-on and face-on disk galaxies in the Local Universe and allow us to improve the spatial model of the stellar components of a typical spiral galaxy. In NGC4631, the revealed asymmetry of its stellar thick disk and halo, is likely caused by the neighbor dwarf galaxy NGC4627. Based on the tip of the red giant branch method (TRGB) we estimated a distance of 10.42+/-0.38 Mpc for IC2233, 5.62+/-0.20 Mpc for IC5052, 7.11+/-0.13 Mpc for NGC4631 (6.70+/-0.15 for its satellite NGC4627) and 6.14+/-0.15 Mpc for NGC5023. We confirm the presence of slight extraplanar metallicity gradient of evolved stars at NGC5023 and IC5052, based on the systematic changes of the colour distribution of red giant stars.},

	Abstract = {We present the preliminary detection of a stellar halo in the nearby, edge-on galaxy, NGC 4244. Using data from the Hubble Space Telescope's Advanced Camera for Surveys (HST/ACS), we have examined number counts of red giant branch (RGB) stars along the minor axis of the galaxy out to 10 kpc, with a limiting surface brightness of mu_R ~ 31 mag/arcsec^2. At distances more than 2.5 kpc above the disk, a second stellar component is clearly visible. This component is well fit by either an exponential or a power law. The best-fit exponential scale height is similar to the scale length of the galaxy disk, suggesting that we are indeed detecting a halo component. Furthermore, the color of the RGB stars above 2.5 kpc are significantly bluer than those in the disk, suggesting a more metal-poor population. Outside the local group, this finding represents one of the first detections of a resolved stellar halo in a spiral galaxy.},

	Abstract = {We show initial results from our ongoing HST GHOSTS survey of the resolved stellar envelopes of 14 nearby, massive disk galaxies. In hierarchical galaxy formation the stellar halos and thick disks of galaxies are formed by accretion of minor satellites and therefore contain valuable information about the (early) assembly process of galaxies. We detect for the first time the very small halo of NGC4244, a low mass edge-on galaxy. We find that massive galaxies have very extended halos, with equivalent surface brightnesses of 28-29 V-mag/arcsec^2 at 20-30 kpc from the disk. The old RGB stars of the thick disk in the NGC891 and NGC4244 edge-on galaxies truncate at the same radius as the young thin disk stars, providing insights into the formation of both disk truncations and thick disks. We furthermore present the stellar populations of a very low surface brightness stream around M83, the first such a stream resolved into stars beyond those of the Milky Way and M31.},

Within the broad context of hierachical structure formation, we have only a crude picture of how galaxies like our own came into existence. A detailed physical picture where individual stellar populations can be associated with (tagged to) elements of the protocloud is far beyond our current understanding. Important clues have begun to emerge from both the Galaxy (near-field cosmology) and the high redshift universe (far-field cosmology). Here we focus on the fossil evidence provided by the Galaxy. Detailed studies of the Galaxy lie at the core of understanding the complex processes involved in baryon dissipation.

	Abstract = {Here we introduce the Delaunay Density Estimator Method. Its purpose is rendering a fully volume-covering reconstruction of a density field from a set of discrete data points sampling this field. Reconstructing density or intensity fields from a set of irregularly sampled data is a recurring key issue in operations on astronomical data sets, both in an observational context as well as in the context of numerical simulations. Our technique is based upon the stochastic geometric concept of the Delaunay tessellation generated by the point set. We shortly describe the method, and illustrate its virtues by means of an application to an N-body simulation of cosmic structure formation. The presented technique is a fully adaptive method: automatically it probes high density regions at maximum possible resolution, while low density regions are recovered as moderately varying regions devoid of the often irritating shot-noise effects. Of equal importance is its capability to sharply and undilutedly recover anisotropic density features like filaments and walls. The prominence of such features at a range of resolution levels within a hierarchical clustering scenario as the example of the standard CDM scenario is shown to be impressively recovered by our scheme.},

	Abstract = {We make predictions for diffuse stellar mass fractions in dark matter halos from the scales of small spiral galaxies to those of large galaxy clusters. We use an extensively-tested analytic model for subhalo infall and evolution and empirical constraints from galaxy survey data to set the stellar mass in each accreted subhalo to model diffuse light. We add stellar mass to the diffuse light as subhalos become disrupted due to interactions within their host halos. We predict that the stellar mass fraction in diffuse, intrahalo light should rise on average from ~0.5% to approximately 20% from small galaxy halos to poor groups. The trend with mass flattens considerably beyond the group scale to a near-constant fraction of roughly ~20% in galaxy clusters, although this asymptotic value may be as high as ~40%, depending on the empirical model used to populate satellite halos with stars. The mass-dependent diffuse light fraction is governed primarily by the empirical fact that the mass-to-light ratio in galaxy halos must vary as a function of halo mass. Galaxy halos have little diffuse light because they accrete most of their mass in small subhalos that themselves have high mass-to-light ratios; stellar halos around galaxies are built primarily from disrupted dwarf-irregular-type galaxies with M*~10^8.5 M_sun. The diffuse light in group and cluster halos is built from satellite galaxies that form stars efficiently and have correspondingly low mass-to-light ratios; intracluster light is dominated by material liberated from massive galaxies with M*~10^11 M_sun. Our results are consistent with existing observations spanning the galaxy, group, and cluster scale; however, they can be tested more rigorously in future deep surveys for faint diffuse light.},

	Abstract = {IR spectroscopy provides a valuable tool for the characterisation and identification of interstellar molecular species. Here, we present 6-9 mum spectra of a sample of reflection nebulae, HII regions, YSOs, evolved stars and galaxies that show strong unidentified infrared bands, obtained with the SWS spectrograph on board ISO. The IR emission features in this wavelength region show pronounced variations. 1) The 6.2 mum feature shifts from 6.22 to 6.3 mum and clearly shows profile variations. 2) The 7.7 mum complex is comprised of at least two subpeaks peaking at 7.6 and one longwards of 7.7 mum. In some cases the main peak can apparently shift up to 8 mum. Two sources do not exhibit a 7.7 mum complex but instead show a broad emission feature at 8.22 mum. 3) The 8.6 mum feature has a symmetric profile in all sources and some sources exhibit this band at slightly longer wavelengths. For the 6.2, 7.7 and 8.6 mum features, the sources have been classified independently based on their profile and peak position. The classes derived for these features are directly linked with each other. Sources with a 6.2 mum feature peaking at ~ 6.22 mum exhibit a 7.7 mum complex dominated by the 7.6 mum component. In contrast, sources with a 6.2 mum profile peaking longwards of 6.24 mum show a 7.7 mum complex with a dominant peak longwards of 7.7 mum and a 8.6 mum feature shifted toward the red. Furthermore, the observed 6-9 mum spectrum depends on the type of object. All ISM-like sources and a few PNe and Post-AGB stars belong to the first group while isolated Herbig AeBe stars, a few Post-AGB stars and most PNe belong to the second group. We summarise existing laboratory data and theoretical quantum chemical calculations of the modes emitting in this wavelength region of PAH molecules. We discuss the variations in peak position and profile in view of the exact nature of the carrier. We attribute the observed 6.2 mum profile and peak position to the combined effect of a PAH family and anharmonicity with pure PAHs representing the 6.3 mum component and substituted/complexed PAHs representing the 6.2 mum component. The 7.6 mum component is well reproduced by both pure and substituted/complexed PAHs but the 7.8 mum component remains an enigma. In addition, the exact identification of the 8.22 mum feature remains unknown. The observed variations in the characteristics of the IR emission bands are linked to the local physical conditions. Possible formation and evolution processes that may influence the interstellar PAH class are highlighted. Based on observations with ISO, an ESA project with instruments funded by ESA Member States (especially the PI countries: France, Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom) and with the participation of ISAS and NASA.},

Here we describe gamma- and X-ray observations of the most distant GRB ever observed (GRB 050904): its redshift (z) of 6.29 means that this explosion happened 12.8 billion years ago, corresponding to a time when the Universe was just 890 million years old, close to the reionization era. This means that not only did stars form in this short period of time after the Big Bang, but also that enough time had elapsed for them to evolve and collapse into black holes.},

	Abstract = {We present preliminary results from the first 3 months of the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) high Galactic latitude survey in the 14-195 keV band. The survey reaches a flux of ~10-11 ergs cm-2 s-1 and has ~2.7 arcmin (90% confidence) positional uncertainties for the faintest sources. This represents the most sensitive survey to date in this energy band. These data confirm the conjectures that a high-energy-selected active galactic nucleus (AGN) sample would have very different properties from those selected in other bands and that it represents a ``true'' sample of the AGN population. We have identified 86% of the 66 high-latitude sources. Twelve are Galactic-type sources, and 44 can be identified with previously known AGNs. All but five of the AGNs have archival X-ray spectra, enabling us to estimate the line-of-sight column densities and other spectral properties. Both of the z>0.11 objects are blazars. The median redshift of the others (excluding radio-loud objects) is 0.012. We find that the column density distribution of these AGNs is bimodal, with 64% of the nonblazar sources having column densities NH>=1022 cm-2. None of the sources with logLX>43.5 (cgs units) show high column densities, and very few of the lower LX sources have low column densities. Based on these data, we expect the final BAT catalog to have >200 AGNs and reach fluxes of less than ~10-11 ergs cm-2 s-1 over the entire sky.},

	Abstract = {High-resolution slit spectra are combined with published photometric and velocity data to develop a model of the double-ring planetary nebula NGC 2392. The inner ring is due to an incomplete, prolate spheroid shell with most of the material concentrated near the minor axis circumference. The spheroid is seen almost pole-on, open at the sharp ends, and the formal velocity of expansion (93 km/s) at the ends is a record high for planetary nebulae. The outer ring is a nearly round spheroid of approximately 16 km/s expansion velocity and a different tilt angle than the inner shell. It is surrounded by rapidly expanding material with velocities of at least 75 km/s. A high-velocity stream of material is formed at the open ends of the inner shell and is accelerated by the central star's stellar wind to velocities of at least + or - 190 km/s, providing the first direct evidence for the kinematic role of a strong stellar wind. The inner shell age is approximately 800 yr, arguing that the shell material was preferentially ejected from the equator of the parent star, in contradiction with the usual predictions of theory.},

	Abstract = {What powers a gamma-ray burst (GRB)? We discuss here some properties of several currently favored models based on black hole accretion with emphasis on the collapsar - a rotating massive star whose iron core collapse produces a black hole. Depending on mass, rotation rate, and viewing angle, collapsars can explain a wide gambit of GRBs from faint events like GRB 980425, to bright ones like GRB 971214. Because of accretion disk instabilities, the Gamma in the jet may be rapidly time variable. The burst itself is made by a combination of internal shocks in the jet and external shocks with the pre-explosive stellar wind. Beaming for hard gamma-rays is about 1%, but mildly relativistic matter is ejected at larger angles. All collapsars produce Type Ib/c supernovae like SN 1998bw, but the converse is not true. Most Type Ib/c supernovae do not make GRBs.},

	Abstract = {We present a study of the structure and kinematics of the triple-shell planetary nebula NGC 7662 based on 
long-slit echelle spectroscopic observations and Hubble Space Telescope archival narrowband images. The 
structure of the main nebula consists of a central cavity surrounded by two concentric shells. The bright inner 
shell has a nonnegligible thickness and the highest density in the nebula. The outer shell is filled with nebular 
material whose density profile shows a 
/ r  
1 
drop-off in the inner regions of the shell and flattens in the 
outermost regions. Both the inner and the outer shells can be described as prolate ellipsoids: the inner shell is 
more elongated, while the outermost layer of the outer shell expands faster. The physical structure of NGC 7662 
is qualitatively consistent with the predictions of hydrodynamical simulations based on the interacting stellar 
wind models for planetary nebulae with a 0.605 M 
  central star. Models with a higher asymptotic giant branch 
wind velocity are needed for detailed comparisons.

	Abstract = {Much of the baryonic matter in the universe is in the form of H2, which includes most of the gas in Galactic and extragalactic interstellar clouds. Molecular hydrogen plays a significant role in establishing the thermal balance in many astrophysical environments and can be important as a spectral diagnostic of the gas. Modeling and interpretation of observations of such environments requires a quantitatively complete and accurate treatment of H2. Using this microphysical model of H2, we present illustrative calculations of prototypical astrophysical environments. This work forms the foundation for future investigations of these and other environments in which H2 is an important constituent.},

The computational methods and uncertainties are outlined together with the direction future development will take.

@article{Shaw:1995,
	Abstract = {A set of software tools has been developed for the IRAF/STSDAS environment to derive the physical conditions in a low-density (nebular) gas given appropriate diagnostic emission line ratios; and lien emissivities given appropriate emission line fluxes, the electron temperature (T_e) and density (N_e). The package is based on the five-level program developed by De Robertis, Dufour and Hunt (1987), but it includes diagnostics from a greater set of ions and emission lines, most particularly those in the satellite ultraviolet that are now observable. Two fo the applications make use of a 3-zone nebular model to derive T_e and N_3 simultaneously in separate zones of low-, and intermediate-, and high-ionization. These applications are useful for calculating nebular densities and temperatures directly from the traditional diagnostic line ratios, either to provide some reasonable input parameters for a more complicated physical model, or to calculate ionic abundances (or other quantities) within some simplifying assumptions. Examples of the utility of these diagnostics for real nebulae are presented. (SECTION: Computing and Data Analysis)},

	Abstract = {Wavelengths and identifications have been provided for approximately 300 lines between 3660 and 10125 A in the spectrum of the archetypal bright, high-excitation planetary nebula NGC 7662. These lines are measured with the Hamilton echelle spectrograph at Lick Observatory and are supplemented by image-tube data. Published results are used to construct diagnostic diagrams and derive ionic concentrations. The electron temperature indicated by [O III] is about 12,500 K; the density regimes consist of N epsilon = 5000-17,000 cm-1. Derivation of precise abundances will require appropriate model calculations, but with the aid of homogeneous spherical model procedures we find C to be enhanced, N marginally so if at all, and heavier elements depleted with respect to the Sun. These conclusions are in harmony with those of Barker.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we present a study of the statistical properties of three-dimensional Voronoi tessellations. This unique tiling of space into polyhedral cells generated by a random distribution of seeds is a phenomological model for a cell-like or sponge-like distribution of galaxies. By means of a Monte Carlo study we subsequently turn towards an extensive statistical analysis of several geometrical aspects of three dimensional Voronoi tessellations. To assess the dependence of its geometrical properties on the underlying distribution of nuclei three different distributions are investigated. We generate for each of these distributions four different realizations of tessellations, each of 1000 cells, inside a box with periodic boundary conditions. The first part of this study concerns the moments and distributions of geometrical properties of the tessellations and their building blocks, the cells. In the second part we turn to the properties of planar and linear sections through these three-dimensional tessellations.},

	Abstract = {The large-scale structure of the universe (around 50 Mpc) can be described by means of 'Voronoi foam', which is a partitioning of space obtained by a process called Voronoi tesselation. The first results of a comparison between the statistics of Voronoi foams and the observed galaxy distribution are presented. In particular, it is shown that the spatial two-point correlation function of Voronoi vertices has a power law behavior with almost the same amplitude and slope as that of the Abell clusters. This confirms earlier expectations that Voronoi nodes are to be identified with high-density galaxy clusters in the universe.},

The fate of a VMO is decided in its oxygen core phase. Calculations of the effects of the pair instability, oxygen and silicon burning, and alpha-quenching on the global binding energy of initially isentropic polytropic cores lead to the prediction that the critical oxygen core mass above which complete collapse to a black hole occurs is about 100 solar masses corresponding to an initial star mass greater than 200 solar masses.

@article{Heger:2002,
	Abstract = {Growing evidence suggests that the first generation of stars may have been quite massive (~100-300 Msolar). Could these stars have left a distinct nucleosynthetic signature? We explore the nucleosynthesis of helium cores in the mass range MHe=64-133 Msolar, corresponding to main-sequence star masses of approximately 140-260 Msolar. Above MHe=133 Msolar, without rotation and using current reaction rates, a black hole is formed, and no nucleosynthesis is ejected. For lighter helium core masses, ~40-63 Msolar, violent pulsations occur, induced by the pair instability and accompanied by supernova-like mass ejection, but the star eventually produces a large iron core in hydrostatic equilibrium. It is likely that this core, too, collapses to a black hole, thus cleanly separating the heavy-element nucleosynthesis of pair instability supernovae from those of other masses, both above and below. Indeed, black hole formation is a likely outcome for all Population III stars with main-sequence masses between about 25 and 140 Msolar (MHe=9-63 Msolar) as well as those above 260 Msolar. Nucleosynthesis in pair instability supernovae varies greatly with the mass of the helium core. This core determines the maximum temperature reached during the bounce. At the upper range of exploding core masses, a maximum of 57 Msolar of 56Ni is produced, making these the most energetic and the brightest thermonuclear explosions in the universe. Integrating over a distribution of masses, we find that pair instability supernovae produce a roughly solar distribution of nuclei having even nuclear charge (Si, S, Ar, etc.) but are remarkably deficient in producing elements with odd nuclear charge-Na, Al, P, V, Mn, etc. This is because there is no stage of stable post-helium burning to set the neutron excess. Also, essentially no elements heavier than zinc are produced owing to a lack of s- and r-processes. The Fe/Si ratio is quite sensitive to whether the upper bound on the initial mass function is over 260 Msolar or somewhere between 140 and 260 Msolar. When the yields of pair instability supernovae are combined with reasonable estimates of the nucleosynthesis of Population III stars from 12 to 40 Msolar, this distinctive pattern of deficient production of odd-Z elements persists. Some possible strategies for testing our predictions are discussed.},

@article{Fryer:2001,
	Abstract = {Growing evidence suggests that the first generation of stars may have been quite massive (~100-300 Msolar). If they retain their high mass until death, such stars will, after about 3 Myr, make pair-instability supernovae. Models for these explosions have been discussed in the literature for four decades, but very few included the effects of rotation and none employed a realistic model for neutrino trapping and transport. Both turn out to be very important, especially for those stars whose cores collapse into black holes (helium cores above about 133 Msolar). We consider the complete evolution of two zero-metallicity stars of 250 and 300 Msolar. Despite their large masses, we argue that the low metallicities of these stars imply negligible mass loss. Evolving the stars with no mass loss, but including angular momentum transport and rotationally induced mixing, the two stars produce helium cores of 130 and 180 Msolar. Products of central helium burning (e.g., primary nitrogen) are mixed into the hydrogen envelope with dramatic effects on the radius, especially in the case of the 300 Msolar model. Explosive oxygen and silicon burning cause the 130 Msolar helium core (250 Msolar star) to explode, but explosive burning is unable to drive an explosion in the 180 Msolar helium core, and it collapses to a black hole. For this star, the calculated angular momentum in the presupernova model is sufficient to delay black hole formation, and the star initially forms an ~50 Msolar, 1000 km core within which neutrinos are trapped. The calculated growth time for secular rotational instabilities in this core is shorter than the black hole formation time, and they may develop. If so, the estimated gravitational wave energy and wave amplitude are EGW~10-3 Msolar c2 and h+~10-21/d(Gpc), but these estimates are very rough and depend sensitively on the nonlinear nature of the instabilities. After the black hole forms, accretion continues through a disk. The mass of the disk depends on the adopted viscosity but may be quite large, up to 30 Msolar when the black hole mass is 140 Msolar. The accretion rate through the disk can be as large as 1-10 Msolar s-1. Although the disk is far too large and cool to transport energy efficiently to the rotational axis by neutrino annihilation, it has ample potential energy to produce a 1054 erg jet driven by magnetic fields. The interaction of this jet with surrounding circumstellar gas may produce an energetic gamma-ray transient, but given the probable redshift and the consequent timescale and spectrum, this model may have difficulty explaining typical gamma-ray bursts.},

	Abstract = {We calculate the generic spectral signature of an early population of massive stars at high redshifts. For metal-free stars with mass above 300 Msolar, we find that the combined spectral luminosity per unit stellar mass is almost independent of the mass distribution of these stars. To zeroth order, the generic spectrum resembles a blackbody with an effective temperature of ~105 K, making these stars highly efficient at ionizing hydrogen and helium. The production rate of ionizing radiation per stellar mass by stars more massive than ~300 Msolar is larger by ~1 order of magnitude for hydrogen and He I and by ~2 orders of magnitude for He II than the emission from a standard initial mass function. This would result in unusually strong hydrogen and helium recombination lines from the surrounding interstellar medium. It could also alleviate the current difficulty of ionizing the intergalactic medium at z>~6 with the cosmic star formation rate inferred at somewhat lower redshifts.},

@article{Omukai:2003,
	Abstract = {The process of star formation from metal-free gas is investigated by following the evolution of accreting protostars with emphasis on the properties of massive objects. The main aim is to establish the physical processes that determine the upper mass limit of the first stars. Although the consensus is that massive stars were commonly formed in the first cosmic structures, our calculations show that their actual formation depends sensitively on the mass accretion rate and its time variation. Even in the rather idealized case in which star formation is mainly determined by Macc, the characteristic mass scale of the first stars is rather uncertain. We find that there is a critical mass accretion rate Mcrit~=4x10-3Msolaryr-1 that separates solutions with Macc<Mcrit in which objects with mass >>100 Msolar can form, provided there is sufficient matter in the parent clouds, from others (Macc>Mcrit) where the maximum mass limit decreases as Macc increases. In the latter case, the protostellar luminosity reaches the Eddington limit before the onset of hydrogen burning at the center via the CN cycle. This phase is followed by a rapid and dramatic expansion of the radius, possibly leading to reversal of the accretion flow when the stellar mass is about 100 Msolar. Under a realistic time-dependent accretion rate that starts at high values (~10-2 Msolar yr-1) and decreases rapidly in the high-mass regime (M*>~90 Msolar), the evolution follows the case of Macc<Mcrit and accretion can continue unimpeded by radiation forces. Thus, the maximum mass is set by consideration of stellar lifetimes rather than by protostellar evolution. In this case, the upper limit can be as high as ~600 Msolar. We consider also the sensitivity of the results to the presence of heavy elements with abundances in the range Z=5x10-5 to 5x10-3 Zsolar. The main evolutionary features of protostars are similar to those of metal-free objects, except that the value of Mcrit increases for metal-enriched protostars. Since the accretion rate is lower in a slightly polluted environment, the condition Macc<Mcrit is expected to be more easily met. We find that for metallicities below ~10-2 Zsolar, where radiation forces onto dust grains in the flow are negligible, a slightly metal-rich gas favors continued accretion and the formation of very massive stars.},

@article{Abel:2002,
	Abstract = {We describe results from a fully self-consistent three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulation of the formation of one of the first stars in the Universe. In current models of structure formation, dark matter initially dominates, and pregalactic objects form because of gravitational instability from small initial density perturbations. As they assemble via hierarchical merging, primordial gas cools through ro-vibrational lines of hydrogen molecules and sinks to the center of the dark matter potential well. The high-redshift analog of a molecular cloud is formed. As the dense, central parts of the cold gas cloud become self-gravitating, a dense core of ~100 M (where M is the mass of the Sun) undergoes rapid contraction. At particle number densities greater than 109 per cubic centimeter, a 1 Mprotostellar core becomes fully molecular as a result of three-body H2 formation. Contrary to analytical expectations, this process does not lead to renewed fragmentation and only one star is formed. The calculation is stopped when optical depth effects become important, leaving the final mass of the fully formed star somewhat uncertain. At this stage the protostar is accreting material very rapidly (~102 M year1). Radiative feedback from the star will not only halt its growth but also inhibit the formation of other stars in the same pregalactic object (at least until the first star ends its life, presumably as a supernova). We conclude that at most one massive (M  1 M) metal-free star forms per pregalactic halo, consistent with recent abundance measurements of metal-poor galactic halo stars.},

	Abstract = {In order to constrain the initial mass function of the first generation of stars (Population III), we investigate the fragmentation properties of metal-free gas in the context of a hierarchical model of structure formation. We investigate the evolution of an isolated 3 sigma peak of mass 2x106 Msolar that collapses at zcoll~=30 using smoothed particle hydrodynamics. We find that the gas dissipatively settles into a rotationally supported disk that has a very filamentary morphology. The gas in these filaments is Jeans unstable with MJ~103 Msolar. Fragmentation leads to the formation of high-density (n>108 cm-3) clumps that subsequently grow in mass by accreting the surrounding gas and by merging with other clumps up to masses of ~104 Msolar. This suggests that the very first stars were rather massive. We explore the complex dynamics of the merging and tidal disruption of these clumps by following their evolution over a few dynamical times.},

	Abstract = {How massive stars die-what sort of explosion and remnant each produces-depends chiefly on the masses of their helium cores and hydrogen envelopes at death. For single stars, stellar winds are the only means of mass loss, and these are a function of the metallicity of the star. We discuss how metallicity, and a simplified prescription for its effect on mass loss, affects the evolution and final fate of massive stars. We map, as a function of mass and metallicity, where black holes and neutron stars are likely to form and where different types of supernovae are produced. Integrating over an initial mass function, we derive the relative populations as a function of metallicity. Provided that single stars rotate rapidly enough at death, we speculate on stellar populations that might produce gamma-ray bursts and jet-driven supernovae.},

	Abstract = {The amount of mass loss is of fundamental importance to the lives and deaths of very massive stars, the input of chemical elements and momentum into the interstellar and intergalactic media, as well as the emitted ionizing radiation. I review mass-loss predictions for hot massive stars as a function of metal content for groups of OB stars, Luminous Blue Variables, and Wolf-Rayet stars. Although it is found that the predicted mass-loss rates drop steeply with decreasing metal content (Mdot ~ Z^{0.7-0.85}), I highlight two pieces of physics that are often overlooked: (i) mass-loss predictions for massive stars approaching the Eddington limit, and for (ii) stars that have enriched their own atmospheres with primary elements such as carbon. Both of these effects may significantly boost the mass-loss rates of the first stars - relevant for the reionization of the Universe, and a potential pre-enrichment of the intergalactic medium - prior to the first supernova explosions.},

	Abstract = {Detection of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) from redshifts z>~7 would open a new window into the earliest epoch of cosmic star formation. We construct separate star formation histories at high redshifts for normal (Population I and II) stars and for predominantly massive (Population III) stars. Based on these separate histories, we predict the GRB redshift distribution to be observed by the Swift mission. Regardless of whether Population III progenitors are able to trigger GRBs, we find that a fraction, ~10%, of all bursts detected by Swift will originate at z>~5. This baseline contribution is due to Population I/II star formation, which must have extended out to high redshifts in rare massive galaxies that were enriched by heavy elements earlier than the typical galaxies. In addition, we consider the possible contribution of Population III progenitors to the observable GRB rate. Population III stars are viable progenitors for long-duration GRBs that are triggered by the collapsar mechanism, as long as they can lose their outer envelope through mass transfer to a companion star in a close binary. We find that the likelihood of Population III binaries to satisfy the conditions required by the collapsar mechanism could be enhanced significantly relative to Population I/II binaries. If Population III binaries are common, Swift will be the first observatory to probe Population III star formation at redshifts z>~7.},

We find that it is possible to discern truly primordial populations from the next generation of stars by measuring the metallicity of high-z star forming objects. The very low background of the future James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will enable it to image and study first-light sources at very high redshifts, whereas its relatively small collecting area limits its capability in obtaining spectra of z~10-15 first-light sources to either the bright end of their luminosity function or to strongly lensed sources. With a suitable investment of observing time JWST will be able to detect individual Population III supernovae, thus identifying the very first stars that formed in the Universe.},

@article{Weinmann:2005,
	Abstract = {We consider the feasibility of detecting Population III pair-instability supernovae (PISNe) at very high redshifts with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Four published estimates for the PISN rate show a rather wide dispersion, between 50 and 2200 deg-2 yr-1. Correcting problems with several of these, we conclude that even a fairly optimistic estimate is probably a further order of magnitude lower than this range, at a rate of the order of 4 deg-2 yr-1 at z~15 and 0.2 deg-2 yr-1 at z~25, both with substantial uncertainty. Although such supernovae (SNe) would be bright enough to be readily detectable with the JWST at any relevant redshift, the lower number densities derived here would likely require either a dedicated wide-angle search strategy or a serendipitous search. We expect that typically about 1 deg2 (or 500 JWST NIRCam images) at 4.5 mum must be imaged to detect one PISN at z~15 and about 35 deg2 to detect one at z~25. If some Population III star formation persists to lower redshifts at z~5, then PISNe may also be detectable in wide-angle ground-based Z-band imaging surveys at ZAB~23, at a density of the order of 1 deg-2 of surveyed area. In the Appendix we consider the possible effects of intergalactic dust in obscuring high-redshift SNe or other high-redshift sources. We show that the obscuration at a given rest wavelength will peak at some maximum redshift and thereafter decline. While it may be a significant effect in observations of the very high redshift universe, it is unlikely, even under rather pessimistic assumptions, to completely obscure primordial objects.},

	Abstract = {We review recent theoretical results on the formation of the first stars in the universe, and emphasize related open questions. In particular, we discuss the initial conditions for Population III star formation, as given by variants of the cold dark matter cosmology. Numerical simulations have investigated the collapse and the fragmentation of metal-free gas, showing that the first stars were predominantly very massive. The exact determination of the stellar masses, and the precise form of the primordial initial mass function, is still hampered by our limited understanding of the accretion physics and the protostellar feedback effects. We address the importance of heavy elements in bringing about the transition from an early star formation mode dominated by massive stars to the familiar mode dominated by low-mass stars at later times. We show how complementary observations, both at high redshifts and in our local cosmic neighborhood, can be utilized to probe the first epoch of star formation.},

	Abstract = {How and when did the first generation of stars form at the end of the cosmic dark ages? Quite generically, within variants of the cold dark matter model of cosmological structure formation, the first sources of light are expected to form in ~ 106 M&odot; dark matter potential wells at redshifts z&geq; 20. I discuss the physical processes that govern the formation of the first stars. These so-called Population III stars are predicted to be predominantly very massive, and to have contributed significantly to the early reionization of the intergalactic medium. Such an early reionization epoch is inferred from the recent measurement of the Thomson optical depth by the WMAP satellite. I address the importance of heavy elements in bringing about the transition from an early star formation mode dominated by massive stars, to the familiar mode dominated by low mass stars, at later times, and present possible observational probes. This transition could have been gradual, giving rise to an intermediate-mass population of still virtually metal-free stars ("Population II.5"). These stars could have given rise to the peculiar class of black-hole forming supernovae inferred from the abundance pattern of extremely iron-poor stars.},

@article{Bullock:2005,
	Abstract = {If the favored hierarchical cosmological model is correct, then the Milky Way system should have accreted ~100-200 luminous satellite galaxies in the past \~12 Gyr. We model this process using a hybrid semi-analytic plus N-body approach which distinguishes explicitly between the evolution of light and dark matter in accreted satellites. This distinction is essential to our ability to produce a realistic stellar halo, with mass and density profile much like that of our own Galaxy, and a surviving satellite population that matches the observed number counts and structural parameter distributions of the satellite galaxies of the Milky Way. Our model stellar halos have density profiles which typically drop off with radius faster than those of the dark matter. They are assembled from the inside out, with the majority of mass (~80%) coming from the \~15 most massive accretion events. The satellites that contribute to the stellar halo have median accretion times of ~9 Gyr in the past, while surviving satellite systems have median accretion times of ~5 Gyr in the past. This implies that stars associated with the inner halo should be quite different chemically from stars in surviving satellites and also from stars in the outer halo or those liberated in recent disruption events. We briefly discuss the expected spatial structure and phase space structure for halos formed in this manner. Searches for this type of structure offer a direct test of whether cosmology is indeed hierarchical on small scales.},

@article{Zheng:1999,
	Abstract = {Intrigued by the initial report of an extended luminosity distribution perpendicular to the disk of the edge-on Sc galaxy NGC 5907, we have obtained very deep exposures of this galaxy with a Schmidt telescope, large-format CCD, and intermediate-band filters centered at 6660 {\AA} and 8020 {\AA}. These two filters, part of a 15-filter set, are custom designed to avoid the brightest (and most variable) night skylines. As a result, our images are able to go deeper with lower sky noise than those taken with broadband filters at similar effective wavelengths: e.g., 0.6 e^- arcsec^-2 s^-1 for our observations versus 7.4 e^- arcsec^-2 s^-1 for the R-band measures of Morrison et al. In our assessment of both random and systematic errors, we show that the flux level where the errors of observation reach 1 mag arcsec^-2 are 29.00 mag arcsec^-2 in the 6660 {\AA} image (corresponding to 28.7 in the R band) and 27.4 mag arcsec^-2 in the 8020 {\AA} image (essentially on the I-band system). In a previous paper we have shown that NGC 5907 has a luminous ring around it, most plausibly caused by the tidal disruption of a dwarf spheroidal galaxy by the much more massive spiral. Here we show that, for values fainter than 27 R mag arcsec^-2, the surface brightness around NGC 5907 is strongly asymmetric, being mostly brighter on the northwest (ring) side of the galactic midplane. This asymmetry rules out a halo as the cause of the faint surface brightness we see. We find this asymmetry is likely an artifact resulting from a combination of ring light and residual surface brightness at faint levels from stars that our star-masking procedure cannot completely eliminate. The possible existence of an optical face-on warp in NGC 5907, suggested by our Very Large Array H I observations, is too confused with foreground star contamination to be independently studied. Good agreement with the surface photometry of NGC 5907 by other observers leads us to conclude that their data are similarly affected at faint levels by ring light and the residual effects of star masking procedures. Inspection of published images confirm this to be the case. Thus, we conclude that NGC 5907 does not have a faint extended halo.},

Using both SDSS and public archival data, we have estimated its distance and other physical properties, and compared these to the properties of a previously known dwarf spheroidal companion, Andromeda V, also observed by SDSS. Andromeda IX is the lowest surface brightness galaxy found to date (muV,0~26.8 mag arcsec-2), and at the distance we estimate from the position of the tip of Andromeda IX's red giant branch, (m-M)0~24.5 (805 kpc), Andromeda IX would also be the faintest galaxy known (MV~-8.3).},

	Abstract = {Using the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) on the Hubble Space Telescope, we have obtained deep 
optical images reaching stars well below the oldest main sequence turnoff in three fields of the Andromeda 
Galaxy: the spheroid, tidal stream, and outer disk. These observations allow a complete reconstruction of the 
star formation history in these fields. We analyze the color-magnitude diagrams of the stellar populations in 
these fields by comparison to a grid of theoretical isochrones calibrated to Galactic globular clusters observed 
in the same ACS bands. All three fields exhibit an extended star formation history, with a significant fraction of 
stars younger than 10 Gyr but few stars younger than 4 Gyr. Considered together, the star count maps, radial ve- 
locities, and population characteristics of the spheroid argue against some explanations for its intermediate-age, 
metal-rich population, such as a significant contribution from stars residing in the disk or a chance intersection 
with the orbit of the tidal stream. Instead, it is likely that these intermediate-age, metal-rich stars are intrinsic 
to the inner spheroid, whose highly-disturbed structure is clearly distinct from the pressure-supported metal- 
poor halo that dominates at large distances from the galaxy's center. The stream and spheroid populations 
are similar, but not identical, with the mean age in the stream being  1 Gyr younger; the similarity between 
the stream and spheroid populations suggests that the inner spheroid is largely polluted by material stripped 
from the stream's progenitor or by objects like this progenitor. The disk population is considerably younger 
and more metal-rich than the stream and spheroid populations, but not as young as the thin disk population of 
the solar neighborhood; instead, the outer disk of Andromeda is dominated by intermediate-age stars of age 
4--8 Gyr, resembling the Milky Way's thick disk population. The disk data are inconsistentdominated by ages older than 10 Gyr, and in fact do not require any stars older than 10 Gyr.},

	Abstract = {Conventional algorithms for rejecting cosmic rays in single CCD exposures rely on the contrast between cosmic rays and their surroundings and may produce erroneous results if the point-spread function is smaller than the largest cosmic rays. This paper describes a robust algorithm for cosmic-ray rejection, based on a variation of Laplacian edge detection. The algorithm identifies cosmic rays of arbitrary shapes and sizes by the sharpness of their edges and reliably discriminates between poorly sampled point sources and cosmic rays. Examples of its performance are given for spectroscopic and imaging data, including Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 images.},

	Abstract = {Star-forming nuclear rings in barred galaxies are common in nearby spirals, and their detailed study can lead to important insights into the evolution of galaxies, their bars, and their central regions. We present integral field spectroscopic observations obtained with SAURON of the bar and circumnuclear region of the barred spiral galaxy M100, complemented by new {\it Spitzer Space Telescope} imaging of the region. We use these data to enhance our understanding of the formation, evolution, and current properties of the bar and ring. We derive the kinematics of the gas and the stars and quantify circular and non-circular motions using kinemetry. We analyse this in conjunction with the optical and infrared morphology, and our previously published dynamical modelling. By comparing line indices to simple stellar population models we estimate the ages and metallicities of the stellar populations present within the region, especially in and around the ring. Our kinematic and morphological results all confirm the picture in which the nuclear ring in M100, considered typical, is fed by gas flowing in from the disc under the action of the bar, is slowed down near a pair of resonances, and forms significant amounts of massive stars. Detailed stellar population modelling shows how the underlying bulge and disc were put in place a number of Gyr ago, and that the nuclear ring has been forming stars since about 500~Myr ago in a stable succession of bursts. This confirms that nuclear rings of this kind can form under the influence of a resonant structure set up by a bar, and proves that they are stable features of a galaxy rather than one-off starburst events.},

	Abstract = {Despite the increasing number of studies of barred galaxies at intermediate and high redshifts, double-barred (S2B) systems have only been identified in the nearby (z <= 0.04) universe thus far. In this feasibility study, we demonstrate that the detection and analysis of S2Bs is possible at intermediate redshifts (0.1 <~ z <~ 0.5) with the exquisite resolution of the Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys (HST/ACS). We identify barred galaxies in the HST/ACS data of the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS) using a novel method. The radial profile of the Gini coefficient - a model-independent structure parameter - is able to detect bars in early-type galaxies that are large enough that they might host an inner bar of sufficient angular size. Using this method and subsequent examination with unsharp masks and ellipse fits, we identified the two most distant S2Bs currently known (at redshifts z = 0.103 and 0.148). We investigate the underlying stellar populations of these two galaxies through a detailed colour analysis, in order to demonstrate the analysis that could be performed on a future sample of intermediate-redshift S2Bs. We also identify two S2Bs and five S2B candidates in the HST/ACS data of the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS). Our detections of distant S2Bs show that deep surveys like GOODS and COSMOS have the potential to push the limit for S2B detection and analysis out by a factor of 10 in redshift and look-back time (z ~ 0.5, Deltat ~ 5Gyr) compared to the previously known S2Bs.

	Abstract = {We present the initial results of a Hubble Space Telescope/Advanced Camera for Surveys snapshot survey of 16 nearby, edge-on, late-type galaxies covering a range in distance from 2 to 19 Mpc. The images of these galaxies show significant resolved stellar populations. We derive F606W and F814W photometry for more than 1.2 million stars and present color-magnitude diagrams that show a mixture of young, intermediate, and old stars in each galaxy. In one of the fields we serendipitously detect stars from the Large Magellanic Cloud. We also identify a candidate young dwarf galaxy lying ~2 kpc above the plane of NGC 4631. For the nearest six galaxies, we derive tip of the red giant branch distances and demonstrate that these galaxies fall on the K-band Tully-Fisher relation established in clusters. From the color of the red giant branch, we also find evidence that these galaxies possess a metal-poor thick-disk or halo population.},

	Abstract = {We analyze the vertical distribution of the resolved stellar populations in six low-mass (Vmax=67-131 km s-1), edge-on, spiral galaxies observed with the Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys. In each galaxy we find evidence for an extraplanar stellar component extending up to 15 scale heights (3.5 kpc) above the plane, with a scale height typically twice that of two-dimensional fits to Ks-band Two Micron All Sky Survey images. We analyze the vertical distribution as a function of stellar age by tracking changes in the color-magnitude diagram. The young stellar component (<~108 yr) is found to have a scale height larger than the young component in the Milky Way, suggesting that stars in these low-mass galaxies form in a thicker disk. We also find that the scale height of a stellar population increases with age, with young main-sequence stars, intermediate-age asymptotic giant branch stars, and old red giant branch (RGB) stars having successively larger scale heights in each galaxy. This systematic trend indicates that disk heating must play some role in producing the extraplanar stars. We constrain the rate of disk heating using the observed trend between scale height and stellar age and find that the observed heating rates are dramatically smaller than in the Milky Way. The color distributions of the RGB stars well above the midplane indicate that the extended stellar components we see are moderately metal-poor, with peak metallicities around [Fe/H]=-1 and with little or no metallicity gradient with height. The lack of metallicity gradient can be explained if a majority of extraplanar RGB stars were formed at early times and are not dominated by a younger heated population. Our observations suggest that, like the Milky Way, low-mass disk galaxies also have multiple stellar components. In its structure, mean metallicity, and old age, the RGB component in these galaxies seems analogous to the Milky Way thick disk. However, without additional kinematic and abundance measurements, this association is only circumstantial, particularly in light of the clear existence of some disk heating at intermediate ages. Finally, we find that the vertical dust distribution has a scale height somewhat larger than that of the main-sequence stars.},

@article{Dutton:2005,
	Abstract = {This paper addresses available constraints on mass models fitted to rotation curves. Mass models of disk galaxies have well-known degeneracies that prevent a unique mass decomposition. The most notable is due to the unknown value of the stellar mass-to-light ratio (the disk-halo degeneracy); even with this known, degeneracies between the halo parameters themselves may prevent an unambiguous determination of the shape of the dark halo profile, which includes the inner density slope of the dark matter halo. The latter is often referred to as the ``cusp-core degeneracy.'' We explore constraints on the disk and halo parameters and apply these to four mock and six observed disk galaxies with high resolution and extended rotation curves. Our full set of constraints consists of mass-to-light (M/L) ratios from stellar population synthesis models based on B-R colors, constraints on halo parameters from N-body simulations, and constraining the halo virial velocity to be less than the maximum observed velocity. These constraints are only partially successful in lifting the cusp-core degeneracy. The effect of adiabatic contraction of the halo by the disk is to steepen cores into cusps and reduce the best-fit halo concentration and M/L values (often significantly). We also discuss the effect of disk thickness, halo flattening, distance errors, and rotation curve error values on mass modeling. Increasing the imposed minimum rotation curve error from typically low, underestimated values to more realistic estimates decreases the chi2 substantially and makes distinguishing between a cuspy or cored halo profile even more difficult. In spite of the degeneracies and uncertainties present, our constrained mass modeling favors submaximal disks (i.e., a dominant halo) at 2.2 disk scale lengths, with Vdisk/Vtot<~0.6. This result holds for both the unbarred and weakly barred galaxies in our sample.},

The picture-processing results and the measured properties of the elliptical and gaseous-disk components of NGC 5128 are examined, along with the distribution, spectral characteristics, and chemical composition of the H II regions in the disk. The data show that NGC 5128 consists of a giant E2 galaxy containing a significant amount of gas and dust situated predominantly in an equatorial disk where vigorous star formation is occurring. Reasons why NGC 5128 is so different from giant ellipticals in clusters are considered.},

@article{Talbot:1979,
	Abstract = {UBVR surface photometry of the bright southern spiral galaxy NGC 5236 (M83) is presented. Calibrated maps of UBVR and H-alpha surface brightness and colors are compared with models of evolving mixes of stellar populations in order to establish a measurable drift velocity relative to some feature for the young associations supposedly formed in the wake of a spiral density wave. The color and morphological information is used to remove the effects of recent star formation from the radial profile of surface brightness. A search for systematic color gradients across and behind the spiral arms reveals no systematic gradient within the arms and no significant gradients behind the arms in those regions completely free of stars less than 50 million years old. The lack of a systematic color gradient within the arms is shown to be in agreement with expectations from density-wave theory when proper allowance is made for noncircular orbits and imperfect synchrony of star formation.},

@article{Whalen:2007,
	Abstract = {We present numerical simulations of the photoevaporation of cosmological halos clustered around a 120 M$_\odot$ primordial star, confining our study to structures capable of hosting Population III star formation. The calculations include self-consistent multifrequency conservative transfer of UV photons together with nine-species primordial chemistry and all relevant radiative processes. The ultimate fates of these halos varies with central density and proximity to the central source but generally fall into one of four categories. Diffuse halos with central densities below 2 - 3 cm$^{-3}$ are completely ionized and evaporated by the central star anywhere in the cluster. More evolved halo cores at densities above 2000 cm$^{-3}$ are impervious to both ionizing and Lyman-Werner flux at most distances from the star and collapse of their cores proceeds without delay. Radiative feedback in halos of intermediate density can be either positive or negative, depending on how the I-front remnant shock both compresses and deforms the core and enriches it with H$_2$. We find that the 120 M$_\odot$ star photodissociates H$_2$ in most halos within the cluster but that catalysis by H- rapidly restores molecular hydrogen within a few hundred Kyr after the death of the star, with little delay in star formation. Our models exhibit significant departures from previous one-dimensional spherically-symmetric simulations, which are prone to serious errors due to unphysical geometric focusing effects. },

	Abstract = {(Abridged) We conduct a series of high-resolution, dissipationless N-body simulations to investigate the cumulative effect of substructure mergers onto thin disk galaxies in the context of the LCDM paradigm of structure formation. Our simulation campaign is based on a hybrid approach. Substructure properties are culled directly from cosmological simulations of galaxy-sized cold dark matter (CDM) halos. In contrast to what can be inferred from statistics of the present-day substructure populations, accretions of massive subhalos onto the central regions of host halos, where the galactic disk resides, since z~1 should be common occurrences. One host halo merger history is subsequently used to seed controlled numerical experiments of repeated satellite impacts on an initially-thin Milky Way-type disk galaxy. We show that these accretion events produce several distinctive observational signatures in the stellar disk including: a ring-like feature in the outskirts; a significant flare; a central bar; and faint filamentary structures that (spuriously) resemble tidal streams. The final distribution of disk stars exhibits a complex vertical structure that is well-described by a standard ``thin-thick'' disk decomposition. We conclude that satellite-disk encounters of the kind expected in LCDM models can induce morphological features in galactic disks that are similar to those being discovered in the Milky Way, M31, and in other disk galaxies. These results highlight the significant role of CDM substructure in setting the structure of disk galaxies and driving galaxy evolution. Upcoming galactic structure surveys and astrometric satellites may be able to distinguish between competing cosmological models by testing whether the detailed structure of galactic disks is as excited as predicted by the CDM paradigm. },

	Abstract = {The rich cluster Abell 520 (z=0.201) exhibits truly extreme and puzzling multi-wavelength characteristics. It may best be described as a "cosmic train wreck." It is a major merger showing abundant evidence for ram pressure stripping, with a clear offset in the gas distribution compared to the galaxies (as in the bullet cluster 1E 0657-558). However, the most striking feature is a massive dark core (721 h_70 M_sun/L_sun) in our weak lensing mass reconstruction. The core coincides with the central X-ray emission peak, but is largely devoid of galaxies. An unusually low mass to light ratio region lies 500 kpc to the east, and coincides with a shock feature visible in radio observations of the cluster. Although a displacement between the X-ray gas and the galaxy/dark matter distributions may be expected in a merger, a mass peak without galaxies cannot be easily explained within the current collisionless dark matter paradigm. Interestingly, the integrated gas mass fraction (~0.15), mass-to-light ratio (220 h_70 M_sun/L_sun), and position on the X-ray luminosity-temperature and mass-temperature relations are unremarkable. Thus gross properties and scaling relations are not always useful indicators of the dynamical state of clusters. },

	Abstract = {We have performed a new and homogeneous analysis of all the Li data available in the literature for main sequence stars (spectral-types from late F to K) in open clusters. In the present paper we focus on a detailed investigation of MS Li depletion and its time scales for stars in the 6350-5500 K effective temperature range. For the first time, we were able to constrain the age at which non-standard mixing processes, driving MS Li depletion, appear. We have also shown that MS Li depletion is not a continuous process and cannot be simply described by a t<SUP>-alpha</SUP> law. We confirm that depletion becomes ineffective beyond an age of 1-2 Gyr for the majority of the stars, leading to a Li plateau at old ages. We compared the empirical scenario of Li as a function of age with the predictions of three non-standard models. We found that models including only gravity waves as main mixing process are not able to fit the Li vs. age pattern and thus this kind of mixing can be excluded as the predominant mechanism responsible for Li depletion. On the other hand, models including slow mixing induced by rotation and angular momentum loss, and in particular those including also diffusive processes not related to rotation, can explain to some extent the empirical evidence. However, none of the currently proposed models can fit the plateau at old ages. },

@article{Henry:2000,
	Abstract = {We analyze the behavior of N/O and C/O abundance ratios as a function of metallicity as gauged by O/H in large, extant Galactic and extragalactic H II region abundance samples. We compile and compare published yields of C, N, and O for intermediate mass and massive stars and choose appropriate yield sets based on analytical chemical evolution models fitted to the abundance data. We then use these yields to compute numerical chemical evolution models that satisfactorily reproduce the observed abundance trends and thereby identify the most likely production sites for carbon and nitrogen. Our results suggest that carbon and nitrogen originate from separate production sites and are decoupled from one another. Massive stars (M&gt;8 M<SUB>solar</SUB>) dominate the production of carbon, while intermediate-mass stars between 4 and 8 M<SUB>solar</SUB>, with a characteristic lag time of roughly 250 Myr following their formation, dominate nitrogen production. Carbon production is positively sensitive to metallicity through mass-loss processes in massive stars and has a pseudo-secondary character. Nitrogen production in intermediate mass stars is primary at low metallicity, but when 12+log(O/H)&gt;8.3, secondary nitrogen becomes prominent, and nitrogen increases at a faster rate than oxygen-indeed, the dependence is steeper than would be formally expected for a secondary element. The observed flat behavior of N/O versus O/H in metal-poor galaxies is explained by invoking low star formation rates that flatten the age-metallicity relation and allow N/O to rise to observed levels at low metallicities. The observed scatter and distribution of data points for N/O challenge the popular idea that observed intermittent polluting by oxygen is occurring from massive stars following star bursts. Rather, we find most points cluster at relatively low N/O values, indicating that scatter is caused by intermittent increases in nitrogen caused by local contamination by Wolf-Rayet stars or luminous blue variables. In addition, the effect of inflow of gas into galactic systems on secondary production of nitrogen from carbon may introduce some scatter into N/O ratios at high metallicities. },

	Abstract = {Recent new high-precision abundance data for Galactic halo stars suggest important primary nitrogen production in very metal-poor massive stars. Here, we compute a new model for the chemical evolution of the Milky Way aimed at explaining these new abundance data. The new data can be explained by adopting: a) the stellar yields obtained from stellar models that take into account rotation; and b) an extra production of nitrogen in the very metal-poor massive stars. In particular, we suggest an increase of nearly a factor of 200 in <SUP>14</SUP>N for a star of 60 M<SUB>o</SUB> and ~=40 for a star of 9 M<SUB>o</SUB>, for metallicities below Z=10<SUP>-5</SUP>, with respect to the yields given in the literature for Z=10<SUP>-5</SUP> and rotational velocity of 300 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. We show that once we adopt the above prescriptions, our model is able to predict high N/O abundance ratios at low metallicities and still explains the nitrogen abundances observed in thin disk stars in the solar vicinity. The physical motivation for a larger nitrogen production in massive stars in very metal-poor environments could be the fact that some stellar models as well as observational data suggest that at low metallicities stars rotate faster. If this is the case, such large nitrogen production seen in the pristine phases of the halo formation would not necessarily happen in Damped Lyman-alpha systems which have metallicities always above [Fe/H]~= -2.5, and could have been pre-enriched. We also compute the abundance gradient of N/O along the Galactic disk and show that a negative gradient is predicted once we adopt stellar yields where rotation is taken into account. The latter result implies that intermediate mass stars contribute less to the primary nitrogen than previously thought. },

	Abstract = {A detailed study of the planetary nebula NGC 6565 has been carried out on long-slit echellograms (lambda /Delta lambda =60 000, spectral range = lambda lambda 3900-7750 &#197;) at six, equally spaced position angles. The expansion velocity field, the c(Hbeta ) distribution and the radial profile of the physical conditions (electron temperature and density) are obtained. The distance, radius, mass and filling factor of the nebula and the temperature and luminosity of the central star are derived. The radial ionization structure is analyzed using both the classical method and the photo-ionization code CLOUDY. Moreover, we present the spatial structure in a series of images from different directions, allowing the reader to ``see'' the nebula in 3-D. NGC 6565 results to be a young (2000-2500 years), patchy, optically thick triaxial ellipsoid (a=10.1 arcsec, a/b=1.4, a/c=1.7) projected almost pole-on. The matter close to major axis was swept-up by some accelerating agent (fast wind? ionization? magnetic fields?), forming two faint and asymmetric polar cups. A large cocoon of almost neutral gas completely embeds the ionized nebula. NGC 6565 is in a recombination phase, because of the luminosity drop of the massive powering star, which is reaching the white dwarf domain (log T<SUB>*</SUB> =~ 5.08 K; log L<SUB>*</SUB>/L<SUB>sun</SUB> =~ 2.0). The stellar decline started about 1000 years ago, but the main nebula remained optically thin for other 600 years before the recombination phase occurred. In the near future the ionization front will re-grow, since the dilution factor due to the expansion will prevail on the slower and slower stellar decline. NGC 6565 is at a distance of 2.0 (+/-0.5) kpc and can be divided into three radial zones: the ``fully ionized'' one, extending up to 0.029-0.035 pc at the equator (0.050 pc at the poles), the ``transition'' one, up to 0.048-0.054 pc (0.080 pc), the ``halo'', detectable up to 0.110 pc. The ionized mass ( =~ 0.03 M<SUB>sun</SUB>) is only a fraction of the total mass (&gt;= 0.15 M<SUB>sun</SUB>), which has been ejected by an equatorial enhanced superwind of 4 (+/-2) x 10<SUP>-5</SUP> M<SUB>sun</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP> lasted for 4 (+/-2) x 10<SUP>3</SUP> years. Based on observations made with ESO Telescopes at the La Silla Observatories, under programme ID 65.I-0524, and on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained from the data archive at the Space Telescope Institute (observing program GO 7501; P.I. Arsen Hajian). STScI is operated by the association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc. under the NASA contract NAS 5-26555. We have applied the photoionization code CLOUDY, developed at the Institute of Astronomy of the Cambridge University. },

	Abstract = {In this paper, we employ a new statistical analysis technique, ensemble learning for independent component analysis (EL-ICA), on the synthetic galaxy spectra from a newly released high-resolution evolutionary model by Bruzual &#38; Charlot. We find that EL-ICA can sufficiently compress the synthetic galaxy spectral library to six nonnegative independent components (ICs), which are good templates for modeling huge amounts of normal galaxy spectra, such as the galaxy spectra in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Important spectral parameters, such as starlight reddening, stellar velocity dispersion, stellar mass, and star formation histories, can be given simultaneously by the fit. Extensive tests show that the fit and the derived parameters are reliable for galaxy spectra with the typical quality of the SDSS. },

	Abstract = {We present new narrowband filter imagery in Halpha and [N II] lambda6584, along with UV and optical spectrophotometry measurements from 1200 to 9600 &#197; of NGC 7293, the Helix Nebula, a nearby, photogenic planetary nebula of large diameter and low surface brightness. Detailed models of the observable ionized nebula support the recent claim that the Helix is actually a flattened disk whose thickness is roughly one-third its diameter, with an inner region containing hot, highly ionized gas that is generally invisible in narrowband images. The outer visible ring structure is of lower ionization and temperature and is brighter because of a thickening in the disk. We also confirm a central star effective temperature and luminosity of 120,000 K and 100 L_solar, and we estimate a lower limit to the nebular mass to be 0.30 M_solar. Abundance measurements indicate the following values: He/H=0.12 (+/-0.017), O/H=4.60x10^-4 (+/-0.18), C/O=0.87 (+/-0.12), N/O=0.54 (+/-0.14), Ne/O=0.33 (+/-0.04), S/O=3.22x10^-3 (+/-0.26), and Ar/O=6.74x10^-3 (+/-0.76). Our carbon abundance measurements represent the first of their kind for the Helix Nebula. The S/O ratio that we derive is anomalously low; such values are found in only a few other planetary nebulae. The central star properties, the supersolar values of He/H and N/O, and a solar level of C/O are consistent with a 6.5 M_solar progenitor that underwent three phases of dredge-up and hot bottom burning before forming the planetary nebula. },

	Abstract = {We report our search for optically thick radio cores in 16 narrow-waist bipolar nebulae. Optically thick cores are a characteristic signature of collimated ionized winds. Eleven northern nebulae were observed with the Very Large Array (VLA) at 1.3 and 0.7 cm, and five southern nebulae were observed with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) at 6 and 3.6 cm. Two northern objects, 19W32 and M1-91, and three southern objects, He 2-25, He 2-84, and Mz 3, were found to exhibit a compact radio core with a rising spectrum consistent with an ionized jet. Such jets have been seen in M2-9 and may be responsible for shaping bipolar structure in planetary nebulae. },

	Abstract = {We have obtained X-ray observations of the bipolar planetary nebulae (PNe) NGC 2346 and NGC 7026 with XMM-Newton. These observations detected diffuse X-ray emission from NGC 7026 but not from NGC 2346. The X-ray emission from NGC 7026 appears to be confined within the bipolar lobes of the PN and has spectral properties suggesting a thermal plasma emitting at a temperature of 1.1<SUP>+0.5</SUP><SUB>-0.2</SUB>&#215;10<SUP>6</SUP> K. The X-ray spectrum of NGC 7026 is modeled using nebular and stellar abundances to assess whether a significant amount of nebular material has been mixed into the shocked wind, but the results of this comparison are not conclusive owing to the small number of counts detected. Observations of bipolar PNe indicate that diffuse X-ray emission is much less likely detected in open-lobed nebulae than closed-lobed nebulae, possibly because open-lobed nebulae do not have strong fast winds or are unable to retain hot gas. },

	Abstract = {The planetary nebula NGC 2392 possesses an extremely unusual spectrokinematic morphology, characterized by several strange and elusive structures. In this paper, extensive narrowband imaging of the source is used to investigate the shell excitation structure, while [O III] and [S II] images are ratioed to provide fully sampled mapping of electron density and temperature. As a result, we are able to confirm the presence of low densities in the various filamentary structures, an appreciable radial decrease in density in the outer shell, and finally, a probable regime of higher shell densities at the interface of the bright inner shell and lower intensity outer halo. Although temperatures are more uniform, we also find evidence for a significant temperature enhancement close to the inner-outer shell interface, and it is proposed that both anomalies (in density and temperature) arise in a postshock cooling regime. Finally, present imaging and prior spectroscopy are used to construct a revised model of the source, in which it is argued that the outer filamentary structure occupies a disklike regime, congruent with the principal plane of the outer spheroid. Individual filaments arise from low-excitation density contrasts, created through the interaction between the outer shell and a precessing jet. },

	Abstract = {High-dispersion near-infrared spectra have been taken of seven highly evolved, variable, intermediate-mass (4-6 M<SUB>solar</SUB>) asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud and Small Magellanic Cloud in order to look for C, N and O variations that are expected to arise from third dredge-up and hot-bottom burning. The pulsation of the objects has been modelled, yielding stellar masses, and spectral synthesis calculations have been performed in order to derive abundances from the observed spectra. For two stars, abundances of C, N, O, Na, Al, Ti, Sc and Fe were derived and compared with the abundances predicted by detailed AGB models. Both stars show very large N enhancements and C deficiencies. These results provide the first observational confirmation of the long-predicted production of primary nitrogen by the combination of third dredge-up and hot-bottom burning in intermediate-mass AGB stars. It was not possible to derive abundances for the remaining five stars: three were too cool to model, while another two had strong shocks in their atmospheres which caused strong emission to fill the line cores and made abundance determination impossible. The latter occurrence allows us to predict the pulsation phase interval during which observations should be made if successful abundance analysis is to be possible. },

	Abstract = {We present new &lt;bold/&gt; synthetic models of the TP-AGB evolution. They are computed for 7 values of initial metal content (Z from 0.0001 to 0.03) and for initial masses between 0.5 and 5.0 M_o, thus extending the low- and intermediate-mass tracks of Girardi et al. (2000) to the beginning of the post-AGB phase. The calculations are performed by means of a synthetic code that incorporates many recent improvements, among which we mention: (1) the use of detailed and revised analytical relations to describe the evolution of quiescent luminosity, inter-pulse period, third dredge-up, hot bottom burning, pulse cycle luminosity variations, etc.; (2) the use of variable molecular opacities - i.e. opacities consistent with the changing photospheric chemical composition - in the integration of a complete envelope model, instead of the standard choice of scaled-solar opacities; (3) the use of formalisms for the mass-loss rates derived from pulsating dust-driven wind models of C- and O-rich AGB stars; and (4) the switching of pulsation modes between the first overtone and the fundamental one along the evolution, which has consequences in terms of the history of mass loss. It follows that, in addition to the time evolution on the HR diagram, the new models also consistently predict variations in surface chemical compositions, pulsation modes and periods, and mass-loss rates. The onset and efficiency of the third dredge-up process are calibrated in order to reproduce basic observables like the carbon star luminosity functions in the Magellanic Clouds and TP-AGB lifetimes (star counts) in Magellanic Cloud clusters. In this first paper, we describe in detail the model ingredients, basic properties, and calibration. Particular emphasis is put on illustrating the effects of using variable molecular opacities. Forthcoming papers will present the theoretical isochrones and chemical yields derived from these tracks and additional tests performed with the aid of a complete population synthesis code.<p>  Appendix A is only available in electronic form at http://www.aanda.org },

	Abstract = {Context: Thermally pulsating asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars are the main producers of slow neutron capture (s-) process elements, but there are still large uncertainties associated with the formation of the main neutron source, <SUP>13</SUP>C, and with the physics of these stars in general. Observations of s-process element enhancements in stars can be used as constraints on theoretical models.  Aims: For the first time we have applied stellar population synthesis to the problem of s-process nucleosynthesis in AGB stars, in order to derive constraints on free parameters describing the physics behind the third dredge-up and the properties of the neutron source.  Methods: We utilize a rapid evolution and nucleosynthesis code to synthesize different populations of s-enhanced stars, and compare them to their observational counterparts to find out which values of the free parameters in the code produce synthetic populations that fit the observed populations best. These free parameters are the amount of third dredge-up, the minimum core mass for third dredge-up, the effectiveness of <SUP>13</SUP>C as a source of neutrons, and the size in mass of the <SUP>13</SUP>C pocket.  Results: We find that galactic disk objects are reproduced by a spread of a factor of two in the effectiveness of the <SUP>13</SUP>C neutron source. Lower metallicity objects can be reproduced only by lowering the average value of the effectiveness of the <SUP>13</SUP>C neutron source needed for the galactic disk objects by at least a factor of 3. Using observations of s-process elements in post-AGB stars as constraints we find that dredge-up has to start at a lower core mass than predicted by current theoretical models, that it has to be substantial (lambda&gap; 0.2) in stars with mass M &lap; 1.5 M<SUB>o</SUB>, and that the mass of the <SUP>13</SUP>C pocket must be about 1/40 that of the intershell region.<p>  Appendix A is only available in electronic form at http://www.aanda.org },

@article{Marigo:2003,
	Abstract = {The elemental abundances of ten planetary nebulae, derived with high accuracy including ISO and IUE spectra, are analysed with the aid of synthetic evolutionary models for the TP-AGB phase. The accuracy on the observed abundances is essential in order to make a reliable comparison with the models. The advantages of the infrared spectra in achieving this accuracy are discussed. Model prescriptions are varied until we achieve the simultaneous reproduction of all elemental features, which allows placing important constraints on the characteristic masses and nucleosynthetic processes experienced by the stellar progenitors. First of all, it is possible to separate the sample into two groups of PNe, one indicating the occurrence of only the third dredge-up during the TP-AGB phase, and the other showing also the chemical signature of hot-bottom burning. The former group is reproduced by stellar models with variable molecular opacities (see Marigo \cite{Marigo2002}), adopting initial solar metallicity, and typical efficiency of the third dredge-up, lambda   ~  0.3-0.4. The latter group of PNe, with extremely high He content (0.15 &lt;=He/H &lt;=0.20) and marked oxygen deficiency, is consistent with original sub-solar metallicity (i.e. LMC composition). Moreover, we are able to explain quantitatively both the N/H-He/H correlation and the N/H-C/H anti-correlation, thus solving the discrepancy pointed out long ago by Becker &#38; Iben (\cite{Becker1980}). This is obtained only under the hypothesis that intermediate-mass TP-AGB progenitors (M &gt;~ 4.5-5.0 M<SUB>sun</SUB>) with LMC composition have suffered a number of very efficient, carbon-poor, dredge-up events. Finally, the neon abundances of the He-rich PNe can be recovered by invoking a significant production of <SUP>22</SUP>Ne during thermal pulses, which would imply a reduced role of the <SUP>22</SUP>Ne(alpha , n)<SUP>25</SUP>Mg reaction as neutron source to the s-process nucleosynthesis in these stars. },

	Abstract = {Calculations that demonstrate the influence of three key nuclear reaction rates on the evolution of asymptotic giant branch stars have been carried out. We study the case of a star with an initial mass of 2M<SUB>o</SUB> and a metallicity of Z=0.01, somewhat less than the solar metallicity. The dredge-up of nuclear processed material from the interior of the star and the yield predictions for carbon are sensitive to the rate of the <SUP>14</SUP>N(p,gamma)<SUP>15</SUP>O and triple-alpha reactions. These reactions dominate the H- and He-burning shells of stars in this late evolutionary phase. Published uncertainty estimates for each of these two rates propagated through stellar evolution calculations cause uncertainties in carbon enrichment and yield predictions of about a factor of 2. The other important He-burning reaction, <SUP>12</SUP>C(alpha,gamma)<SUP>16</SUP>O, although associated with the largest uncertainty in our study, does not have a significant influence on the abundance evolution compared with other modeling uncertainties. This finding remains valid when the entire evolution from the main sequence to the tip of the asymptotic giant branch is considered. We discuss the experimental sources of the rate uncertainties addressed here and give some outlooks for future work. },

	Abstract = {Observations of stellar streams from accreting dwarf galaxies provide tantalizing insight into the processes of galaxy formation. While such stellar streams are difficult to detect due to their extremely low surface brightnesses, the new GHOSTS survey is resolving stellar populations in the halos of nearby galaxies to an unprecedented depth. The challenge then rests in developing a means to effectively search through resolved stellar halo populations to detect stellar streams. We propose that producing halo surface brightness maps using an adaptive spatial binning scheme can allow structures in the stellar populations to be identified. In particular, the Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation binning algorithm allows bins to be sized and placed in a manner that is responsive to the underlying signal to noise ratio characteristics of the photometry. Thus far in testing, the technique has been able to recover the existence of the low surface brightness dwarf galaxy above the plane of NGC 4631 as an unusually bright region in the computed surface brightness map. Additionally, we shall discuss the methods for removing biases due to background galaxies, and the use of colour magnitude diagram region selections for contrast enhancement in the surface brightness maps. This work was done as part of the Space Telescope Science Institute Summer Student Program. },

	Abstract = {In a hierarchical merging scenario, the outer parts of a galaxy are a fossil record of the galaxy's early history. Observations of the outer disks and halos of galaxies thus provide a tool to study individual galaxy histories and test formation theories. Locally, an impressive effort has been made to understand the halo of the Milky Way, Andromeda, and M33. However, due to the stochastic nature of halo formation, a better understanding of this process requires a large sample of galaxies with known halo properties. The GHOSTS project (PI: R. de Jong) aims to characterize the halos and outer portions of 14 nearby (D=4-14 Mpc) spiral galaxies using the Hubble Space Telescope. Detection of individual stars in the outer parts of these galaxies enables us to study both the morphological properties of the galaxies, and determine the stars' metallicity and age. },

This star-pattern recognition pointing algorithm allows pointing errors such as tube flexure and mount misalignment to be intuitively identified and corrected without the need for calibrating positional encoders. This star-pattern recognition algorithm is based on comparing the shapes of visible patterns of six stars in any given field of view to a pre-compiled catalog of star-patterns that is generated by a software package called Star Field Simulator. A second-generation algorithm is presented in this paper that features an empirical image appearance prediction system, which adds photometric measurements to the star-pattern recognition. This allows the effects of unresolvable clusters of stars, and the presence of non-stellar objects to be included in the star-pattern recognition process through the prediction of an object's pixel brightness and point spread function. Testing with pointing camera images has shown that star appearance on a CCD can be predicted with high accuracy.<p>  The telescope hardware features a unique fiberglass and metal composite construction technique for precision component placement. An innovative placement of the autoguiding camera at the Newtonian prime focus through an on-axis tracking platform is also featured. The telescope is controlled with real-time software, on a laptop computer, using modified Firewire video cameras to provide pointing and tracking data. To test the accuracy of the control algorithms and simulate the effects of errors from environmental and mechanical sources, a software application was written. Results from this and other tests have shown that this telescope can operate within the preset pointing and tracking objectives necessary for scientific utilization. },

	Abstract = {We describe our visualization process for a particle-based simulation of the formation of the first stars and their impact on cosmic history. The dataset consists of several hundred time-steps of point simulation data, with each time-step containing approximately two million point particles. For each time-step, we interpolate the point data onto a regular grid using a method taken from the radiance estimate of photon mapping. We import the resulting regular grid representation into ParaView, with which we extract isosurfaces across multiple variables. Our images provide insights into the evolution of the early universe, tracing the cosmic transition from an initially homogeneous state to one of increasing complexity. Specifically, our visualizations capture the build-up of regions of ionized gas around the first stars, their evolution, and their complex interactions with the surrounding matter. These observations will guide the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope, the key astronomy mission of the next decade. },

	Abstract = {Simulations in general relativity show that the outcome of collapse of a marginally unstable, uniformly rotating star spinning at the mass-shedding limit depends critically on the equation of state. For a very stiff equation of state, which is likely to characterize a neutron star, essentially all of the mass and angular momentum of the progenitor are swallowed by the Kerr black hole formed during the collapse, leaving nearly no residual gas to form a disk. For a soft equation of state with an adiabatic index Gamma-4/3&lt;&lt;1, which characterizes a very massive or supermassive star supported predominantly by thermal radiation pressure, as much as 10% of the mass of the progenitor avoids capture and goes into a disk about the central hole. We present a semianalytic calculation that corroborates these numerical findings and shows how the final outcome of such a collapse may be determined from simple physical considerations. In particular, we employ a simple energy variational principle with an approximate, post-Newtonian energy functional to determine the structure of a uniformly rotating, polytropic star at the onset of collapse as a function of polytropic index n, where Gamma=1+1/n. We then use this data to calculate the mass and spin of the final black hole and ambient disk. We show that the fraction of the total mass that remains in the disk falls off sharply as 3-n (equivalently, Gamma-4/3) increases. },

We measured precise velocities from two sites, allowing us to detect oscillations and infer a large frequency separation of Deltanu=24.25+/-0.25 muHz. Combining this value with the location of the star in the H-R diagram and comparing with standard evolutionary models, we were able to place constraints on the stellar parameters. In particular, our results indicate that nu Ind has a low mass (0.85+/-0.04 M<SUB>solar</SUB>) and is at least 9 Gyr old. },

	Abstract = {Abundance analyses of stars with planets have revealed that their metallicities are enhanced relative to field stars. Such a trend was originally thought to be due to the accretion of iron-rich planetary material. Based on this assumption, we have developed a stellar evolution code to model stars with nonuniform metallicity distributions. We have calculated polluted stellar evolution tracks for stars with M=0.9-1.2M<SUB>solar</SUB>. Our models encompass a range of initial metal content Z=0.01-0.03, and include metallicity enhancements within the stellar convection zone corresponding to DeltaZ=0.005-0.03. We find that the primary effects of metal enhancement on stellar structure and evolution are expansion of the convection zone and downward shift of effective temperature. In addition, we have computed the surface metallicities expected for stars of different mass for fixed quantities of pollution; there appears to be no correlation with present observational data on the metallicities of stars known to harbor planets. },

	Abstract = {We apply the Delaunay Tessellation Field Estimator (DTFE) to reconstruct and analyze the matter distribution and cosmic velocity flows in the Local Universe on the basis of the PSCz galaxy survey. The prime objective of this study is the production of optimal resolution three-dimensional maps fully volume-covering of the volume-weighted velocity and density fields throughout the nearby Universe, out to a distance of 150 Mpc/h. Based on the Voronoi and Delaunay tessellation defined by the spatial galaxy sample, DTFE involves the estimate of density values on the basis of the volume of the related Delaunay tetrahedra and the subsequent use of theDelaunay tessellation as natural multidimensional (linear) interpolation grid for the corresponding density and velocity fields throughout the sample volume. The linearized model of the spatial galaxy distribution and the corresponding peculiar velocities of the PSCz galaxy sample, produced by Brachini et al. (1999), forms the input sample for the DTFE study. The DTFE maps reproduce the high-density supercluster regions in optimal detail, both their internal structure as well as their elongated or flattened shape. The corresponding velocity flows trace the bulk and shear flows marking the region extending from the Pisces-Perseus supercluster, via the Local superclusters, towards the Hydra-Centaurus and the Shapley concentration. The most outstanding and unique feature of the DTFE maps is the sharply defined radial outflow regions in and around underdense voids, marking the dynamical importance of voids in the Local Universe. The maximum expansion rate of voids defines a sharp cutoff in the DTFE velocity divergence pdf. We found that on the basis of this cutoff DTFE manages to consistently reproduce the value of O_m ~ 0.35 underlying the linearized velocity dataset. },

	Abstract = {We present the results of nitrogen and oxygen abundance measurements for 185 H II regions spanning a range of radii in 13 spiral galaxies. As expected, the nitrogen-to-oxygen ratio increases linearly with the oxygen abundance for high-metallicity H II regions, indicating that nitrogen is predominantly a secondary element. However, the nitrogen-to-oxygen ratio plateaus for oxygen abundances less than \frac {1}{3} solar [12 + log (O/H) &lt; 8.45], as is also seen in low-metallicity dwarf galaxies. This result suggests that the observed trend in dwarf galaxies is not due to the outflow of enriched material in a shallow gravitational potential. While the effects of the infall of pristine material and delayed nitrogen delivery are still unconstrained, nitrogen does appear to have both a primary and a secondary component at low metallicities in all types of galaxies. },

	Abstract = {We use nonlinear pulsation models to reproduce the observed light and color curves for two samples of bump Cepheid variables, 19 from the Large Magellanic Cloud and 9 from the Small Magellanic Cloud. This analysis determines the fundamental parameters mass, luminosity, effective temperature, metallicity, distance, and reddening for the sample of stars. The use of the light-curve shape alone to determine metallicity is a new modeling technique introduced here. The metallicity, distance, and reddening distributions for the two samples are in agreement with those of similar stellar populations in the literature. The distance modulus of the Large Magellanic Cloud is determined to be 18.54+/-0.018, and the distance modulus of the Small Magellanic Cloud is determined to be 18.93+/-0.024. The mean Cepheid metallicities are Z=0.0091+/-0.0007 and 0.0050+/-0.0005 for the LMC and SMC, respectively. The masses derived from pulsation analysis are significantly less than those predicted by stellar evolutionary models with no or mild convective core overshoot. We show that this discrepancy cannot be accounted for by uncertainties in our input opacities or in mass-loss physics. We interpret the observed mass discrepancy in terms of enhanced internal mixing in the vicinity of the convective core during the main-sequence lifetime and find that the overshoot parameter Lambda<SUB>c</SUB> rises from 0.688+/-0.009H<SUB>p</SUB> at the mean LMC metallicity to 0.746+/-0.009H<SUB>p</SUB> in the SMC. },

	Abstract = {Two new algorithms are described for matching two dimensional coordinate lists of point sources that are signifcantly faster than previous methods. By matching rarely occurring triangles (or more complex shapes) in the two lists, and by ordering searches by decreasing probability of success, it is demonstrated that very few candidates need be considered to find a successful match. Moreover, by immediately testing the suitability of a potential match using an efficient mechanism, the need to process the entire candidate set is avoided, yielding considerable performance improvements. Triangles are described by a cosine metric that reduces the density of triangle space, permitting efficient searches. An alternative shape characterization method that reduces computational overhead in the construction phase is discussed. The algorithms are tested on a set of 10 063 wide-field survey images, with fields-of-view up to 4.8 x 3.6 deg, successfully matching 100% of the images in a mean elapsed time of 6 ms (2.4 GHz Athlon CPU). The elapsed time of the searching phase is shown to vary by less than 1 ms for list sizes between 10 and 200 points, demonstrating that fast, robust searches may be completed in nearly constant time, independent of list size. },

	Abstract = {We present observations of highly inclined, HI deficient, Virgo cluster spiral galaxies. Our high-resolution VLA HI observations of edge-on galaxies allow us to distinguish extraplanar gas from disk gas. All of our galaxies have truncated H-alpha disks, with little or no disk gas beyond a truncation radius. While all the gas disks are truncated, the observations show evidence for a continuum of stripping states: symmetric, undisturbed truncated gas disks indicate galaxies that were stripped long ago, while more asymmetric disks suggest ongoing or more recent stripping. We compare these timescale estimates with results obtained from two-dimensional stellar spectroscopy of the outer disks of galaxies in our sample. One of the galaxies in our sample, NGC 4522 is a clear example of active ram-pressure stripping, with 40% of its detected HI being extraplanar. As expected, the outer disk stellar populations of this galaxy show clear signs of recent (and, in fact, ongoing) stripping. Somewhat less expected, however, is the fact that the spectrum of the outer disk of this galaxy, with very strong Balmer absorption and no observable emission, would be classified as ``k+a'' if observed at higher redshift. Our observations of NGC 4522 and other galaxies at a range of cluster radii allow us to better understand the role that clusters play in the structure and evolution of disk galaxies. },

@article{Park:2007,
	Abstract = {We present a unified picture on the evolution of galaxy luminosity and morphology. Galaxy morphology is found to depend critically on the local environment set up by the nearest neighbor galaxy in addition to luminosity and the large scale density. When a galaxy is located farther than the virial radius from its closest neighbor, the probability for the galaxy to have an early morphological type is an increasing function only of luminosity and the local density due to the nearest neighbor ($\rho_n$). The tide produced by the nearest neighbor is thought to be responsible for the morphology transformation toward the early type at these separations. When the separation is less than the virial radius, i.e. when $\rho_n &gt; \rho_{\rm virial}$, its morphology depends also on the neighbor's morphology and the large-scale background density over a few Mpc scales ($\rho_{20}$) in addition to luminosity and $\rho_n$. The early type probability keeps increasing as $\rho_n$ increases if its neighbor is an early type. But the probability decreases as $\rho_n$ increases when the neighbor is a late type. The cold gas streaming from the late type neighbor can be the reason for the morphology transformation toward late type. The overall early-type fraction increases as $\rho_{20}$ increases when $\rho_n &gt; \rho_{\rm virial}$. This can be attributed to the hot halo gas of the neighbor which is confined by the pressure of the ambient medium held by the background mass. We have also found that galaxy luminosity depends on $\rho_n$, and that the isolated bright galaxies are more likely to be recent merger products. We propose a scenario that a series of morphology and luminosity transformation occur through distant interactions and mergers, which results in the morphology--luminosity--local density relation. },

	Abstract = {In hierarchical galaxy formation the stellar halos of galaxies are formed by the accretion of minor satellites and therefore contain valuable information about the (early) assembly process of galaxies. Our GHOSTS survey measures the stellar envelope properties of 14 nearby disk galaxies by imaging their resolved stellar populations with HST/ACS&#38;WFPC2. Most of the massive galaxies in the sample (Vrot&gt;200 km/s) have very extended stellar envelopes with mu(r) ~ r^{-2.5} power law profiles in the outer regions. For these massive galaxies there is some evidence that the stellar surface density of the profiles correlates with Hubble type and bulge-to-disk ratio, begging the question whether these envelopes are more related to bulges than to a Milky Way-type stellar halo. Smaller galaxies (Vrot 100 km/s) have much smaller stellar envelopes, but depending on geometry, they could still be more luminous than expected from satellite remnants in hierarchical galaxy formation models. Alternatively, they could be created by disk heating through the bombardment of small dark matter sub-halos. We find that galaxies show varying amounts of halo substructure. },

@article{ODell:2002,
	Abstract = {HST emission-line images of five of the arguably closest planetary nebulae have shown that there is a progression of characteristics of their knots. This progression begins with dark tangential structures showing no alignment with the central star and location near the main ionization front. At the end of the progression in the largest nebulae, the knots are located throughout much of the ionized zone, where they are photoionized on the side facing the central star and accompanied by long tails well aligned radially. This modification of characteristics is what would be expected if the knots were formed near or outside the main ionization front, obtaining densities high enough to lead to their being only partially ionized as they are fully illuminated by the Lyman continuum (Lyc) radiation field. Their expansion velocities must be lower than that of the main body of the nebular shell. Their forms are altered by exposure to the radiation field from the star, although it is not clear as to the relative role of radiation pressure acting on the dust component vis-&#224;-vis ionization shadowing. The one object that does not fit into this sequence is NGC 2392, which is the most complex nebula in our sample. In this case the inner part of the nebula is composed of a series of loops of material, some being ionization bounded, which cover only a small fraction of the area illuminated by the star. This complex structure may be what gives rise to the large variations in electron temperature inferred from low spatial resolution observations. Cometary-form knots are seen in the outer part of this object, with these objects closely resembling those found in the largest nebula in our sample, NGC 7293. Based in part on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555. },

The Halpha and [N II] filters pass both lines in such a way that observations in both are necessary to obtain good isolation of either line. We establish that determination of the strength of the underlying continuum can be important, especially in H II regions.

The character of the line asymmetry depends strongly on the nature of the velocity field, i.e., on whether it is due to convective or wave motions. The magnitude of the asymmetry due to acoustic waves is comparable to that due to convective motions. The propagation of acoustic waves in moving granules and intergranular lanes is studied by solving a system of hydrodynamical equations in a three-dimensional model for the solar atmosphere. The temporal variations in the bisector of the line synthesized in a non-LTE approximation agree well with the observational data. },

	Abstract = {We describe a technique for deriving effective temperatures, surface gravities, rotation velocities, and radial velocities from high-resolution near-IR spectra. The technique matches the observed near-IR spectra to spectra synthesized from model atmospheres. Our analysis is geared toward characterizing heavily reddened pre-main-sequence stars, but the technique also has potential applications in characterizing main-sequence and post-main-sequence stars when these lie behind thick clouds of interstellar dust. For the pre-main-sequence stars, we use the same matching process to measure the amount of excess near-IR emission (which may arise in the protostellar disks) in addition to the other stellar parameters. The information derived from high-resolution spectra comes from line shapes and the relative line strengths of closely spaced lines. The values for the stellar parameters we derive are therefore independent of those derived from low-resolution spectroscopy and photometry. The new method offers the promise of improved accuracy in placing young stellar objects on evolutionary model tracks. Tests with an artificial noisy spectrum with typical stellar parameters and a signal-to-noise ratio of 50 indicate a 1 sigma error of 100 K in T<SUB>eff</SUB>, 2 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> in vsini, and 0.13 in continuum veiling for an input veiling of 1. If the flux ratio between the sum of the Na, Sc, and Si lines at 2.2 mum and the (2-0) <SUP>12</SUP>CO band head at 2.3 mum is known to an accuracy of 10%, the errors in our best-fit value for logg will be Deltalogg=0.1-0.2. We discuss the possible systematic effects on our determination of the stellar parameters and evaluate the accuracy of the results derivable from high-resolution spectra. In the context of this evaluation, we quantitatively explore the degeneracy between temperature and gravity that has bedeviled efforts to type young stellar objects using low-resolution spectra. The analysis of high-resolution near-IR spectra of MK standards shows that the technique yields very accurate values for the effective temperature. The greatest uncertainty in comparing our results with optical spectral typing of MK standards is in the spectral type-to-effective temperature conversion for the standards themselves. Even including this uncertainty, the 1 sigma difference between the optical and infrared temperatures for dwarfs at 3000-5800 K is only 140 K. In a companion paper, we present an analysis of heavily extincted young stellar objects in the rho Ophiuchi molecular cloud. },

	Abstract = {We have constructed a detailed radiative transfer disk model which reproduces the main features of the spectrum of the outbursting young stellar object FU Orionis from ~4000 &#197; to ~8 mum. Using an estimated visual extinction A<SUB>V</SUB>~1.5, a steady disk model with a central star mass ~0.3 M<SUB>solar</SUB>, and a mass accretion rate ~2&#215;10<SUP>-4</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, we can reproduce the SED of FU Ori quite well. Higher values of extinction used in previous analysis (A<SUB>V</SUB>~2.1) result in SEDs which are less well fitted by a steady disk model, but might be explained by extra energy dissipation of the boundary layer in the inner disk. With the mid-infrared spectrum obtained by the IRS on board the Spitzer Space Telescope, we estimate that the outer radius of the hot, rapidly accreting inner disk is ~1 AU, using disk models truncated at this outer radius. Inclusion of radiation from a cooler irradiated outer disk might reduce the outer limit of the hot inner disk to ~0.5 AU. In either case, the radius is inconsistent with a pure thermal instability model for the outburst. Our radiative transfer model implies that the central disk temperature T<SUB>c</SUB>&gt;=1000 K out to ~0.5-1 AU, suggesting that the magnetorotational instability can be supported out to that distance. Assuming that the ~100 yr decay timescale in brightness of FU Ori represents the viscous timescale of the hot inner disk, we estimate the viscosity parameter to be alpha~0.2-0.02 in the outburst state, consistent with numerical simulations of the magnetorotational instability in disks. The radial extent of the high-M&dot; region is inconsistent with the model of Bell &#38; Lin, but may be consistent with theories incorporating both gravitational and magnetorotational instabilities. },

	Abstract = {Context: The wings of Balmer lines are often used as effective temperature diagnostics for late-type (F, G, K) stars under the assumption they form in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE).   Aims: Our goal is to investigate the non-LTE excitation and ionisation of hydrogen and the formation of Balmer lines in late-type stellar atmospheres, to establish if the assumption of LTE is justified. Furthermore, we aim to determine which collision processes are important for the problem; in particular, the role of collision processes with hydrogen atoms is investigated.  Methods: A model hydrogen atom for non-LTE calculations has been constructed accounting for various collision processes using the best available data from the literature. The processes included are inelastic collisions with electrons and hydrogen atoms, mutual neutralisation and Penning ionisation. Non-LTE calculations are performed using the MULTI code and the MACKKL semi-empirical solar model, and the relative importance of the collision processes is investigated. Similar calculations are performed for MARCS theoretical models of other late-type stellar atmospheres.  Results: Our calculations show electron collisions alone are not sufficient to establish LTE for the formation of Balmer line wings. Mutual neutralisation and Penning ionisation are found to be unimportant. The role of inelastic collisions with neutral hydrogen is unclear. The available data for these processes is of questionable quality, and different prescriptions for the rate coefficents give significantly different results for the Balmer line wings.   Conclusions: Improved calculations or experimental data are needed for excitation and, particularly, ionisation of hydrogen atoms in low-lying states by hydrogen atom impact at near threshold energies. Until such data are available, the assumption of LTE for the formation of Balmer line wings in late-type stars is questionable. },

	Abstract = {Numerical simulations provide information on solar convection not available by direct observation. We present results of simulations of near surface solar convection with realistic physics: an equation of state including ionization and three-dimensional, LTE radiative transfer using a four-bin opacity distribution function. Solar convection is driven by radiative cooling in the surface thermal boundary layer, producing the familiar granulation pattern. In the interior of granules, warm plasma ascends with ~10% ionized hydrogen. As it approaches and passes through the optical surface, the plasma cools, recombines, and loses entropy. It then turns over and converges into the dark intergranular lanes and further into the vertices between granulation cells. These vertices feed turbulent downdrafts below the solar surface, which are the sites of buoyancy work that drives the convection. Only a tiny fraction of the fluid ascending at depth reaches the surface to cool, lose entropy, and form the cores of these downdrafts. Granules evolve by pushing out against and being pushed in by their neighboring granules, and by being split by overlying fluid that cools and is pulled down by gravity. Convective energy transport properties that are closely related to integral constraints such as conservation of energy and mass are exceedingly robust. Other properties, which are less tightly constrained and/or involve higher order moments or derivatives, are found to depend more sensitively on the numerical resolution. At the highest numerical resolution, excellent agreement between simulated convection properties and observations is found. In interpreting observations it is crucial to remember that surfaces of constant optical depth are corrugated. The surface of unit optical depth in the continuum is higher above granules and lower in the intergranular lanes, while the surface of optical depth unity in a spectral line is corrugated in ways that are influenced by both thermal and Doppler effects. },

	Abstract = {(Abridged) This paper presents an exploration of two fundamental scaling relations of spiral galaxies, the luminosity-rotation speed (or Tully-Fisher; TF) relation, and the size-luminosity (SL) relation, and the dependences of their scatter, at red and IR bands. We verify that the observed virial relations of disk galaxies are given by Vobs \prop L^0.31 and Rd \prop L^0.33 using distance-redshift surveys of high surface brightness (HSB) and low surface brightness (LSB) non-interacting galaxies. Thus the galaxy surface brightness (SB) is Sigma \prop Rd \prop Vobs \prop Mvir^0.33. We derive the first extensive J-band TF and SL relations using 2MASS data products. The TF residuals are fully independent of SB and other tested observables. TF relations (TFRs) for various morphological types have different zero points, but a common slope, such that early-type (redder) disks rotate faster than later-types (bluer) of the same luminosity. This dependence of the TFR is a direct consequence of the more fundamental dependence on color, which itself is related to the galaxy star formation history. The SL relation scatter is mostly dominated by SB, but color also plays a small role. The TF and SL residuals for HSB and LSB galaxies are weakly correlated, in agreement with the earlier claim by Courteau &#38; Rix (1999). This suggests that spiral disks of all color, brightness, and barredness are, on average, dominated by dark matter even in their inner parts. The observed scaling relations of disk galaxies are likely the result of the simplest scenario of galaxy formation, but their color dependence remains a challenge to hierarchical structure formation models. The scaling relations and their derivatives are contrasted against galaxy formation models in our companion paper. },

	Abstract = {A robust analysis of galaxy structural parameters, based on the modeling of bulge and disk brightnesses in the BVRH bandpasses, is presented for 121 face-on and moderately inclined late-type spirals. Each surface brightness (SB) profile is decomposed into a sum of a generalized S&#233;rsic bulge and an exponential disk. The reliability and limitations of our bulge-to-disk (B/D) decompositions are tested with extensive simulations of galaxy brightness profiles (one-dimensional) and images (two-dimensional). We have used repeat observations to test the consistency of our decompositions. The average systematic model errors are &lt;~20% and &lt;~5% for the bulge and disk components, respectively. The final set of galaxy parameters is studied for variations and correlations in the context of profile type differences and wavelength dependencies. Galaxy types are divided into three classes according to their SB profile shapes: Freeman type I, type II, and a third ``transition'' class for galaxies whose profiles change from type II in the optical to type I in the infrared. Roughly 43%, 44%, and 13% of type I, type II, and transition galaxies, respectively, comprise our sample. Only type I galaxies, with their fully exponential disks, are adequately modeled by our two-component decompositions, and our main results focus on these profiles. We discuss possible interpretations of Freeman type II profiles. The S&#233;rsic bulge shape parameter for nearby type I late-type spirals shows a range between n=0.1 and 2, but, on average, the underlying surface density profile for the bulge and disk of these galaxies is adequately described by a double-exponential distribution. The distribution of disk scale lengths shows a decreasing trend with increasing wavelength, consistent with a higher concentration of old stars or dust (or both) in the central regions relative to the outer disk. We confirm a coupling between the bulge and disk with a scale length ratio &lt;r<SUB>e</SUB>/h&gt;=0.22+/-0.09, or &lt;h<SUB>bulge</SUB>/h<SUB>disk</SUB>&gt;=0.13+/-0.06 for late-type spirals, in agreement with recent N-body simulations of disk formation. This ratio increases from ~0.20 for late-type spirals to ~0.24 for earlier types. These observations are consistent with bulges of late-type spiral galaxies being more deeply embedded in their host disk than earlier type bulges. Bulges and disks can thus preserve a nearly constant r<SUB>e</SUB>/h but show a great range of SB for any given effective radius. The similar scaling relations for early- and late-type spirals suggest comparable formation and/or evolution scenarios for disk galaxies of all Hubble types. In the spirit of Courteau, de Jong, &#38; Broeils but using our new, more extensive database, we interpret this result as further evidence for regulated bulge formation by redistribution of disk material to the galaxy center, in agreement with models of secular evolution of the disk. },

@article{MacArthur:2004,
	Abstract = {We investigate optical and near-IR color gradients in a sample of 172 low-inclination galaxies spanning Hubble types S0-Irr. The colors are compared with stellar population synthesis models from which luminosity-weighted average ages and metallicities are determined. We explore the effects of different underlying star formation histories and additional bursts of star formation. Our results are robust in a relative sense under the assumption that our galaxies shared a similar underlying star formation history and that no bursts involving more than ~10% of the galaxy mass have occurred in the past 1-2 Gyr. Because the observed gradients show radial structure, we measure ``inner'' and ``outer'' disk age and metallicity gradients. Trends in age and metallicity and their gradients are explored as a function of Hubble type, rotational velocity, total near-IR galaxy magnitude, central surface brightness, and scale length. We find strong correlations in age and metallicity with Hubble type, rotational velocity, total magnitude, and central surface brightness in the sense that earlier-type, faster rotating, more luminous, and higher surface brightness galaxies are older and more metal-rich, suggesting an early and more rapid star formation history for these galaxies. The increasing trends with rotational velocity and total magnitude level off for V<SUB>rot</SUB>&gt;~120kms<SUP>-1</SUP> and M<SUB>K</SUB>&lt;~-23 mag, respectively. This effect is stronger for metallicity (than age), which could reflect a threshold potential above which all metals are retained and thus metallicity saturates at the yield. Outer disk gradients are found to be weaker than the inner gradients as expected for a slower variation of the potential and surface brightness in the outer parts. We find that stronger age gradients are associated with weaker metallicity gradients. Trends in gradients with galaxy parameters are compared with model predictions: these trends do not agree with predictions of semianalytic models of hierarchical galaxy formation, possibly owing to the effect of bar-induced radial flows. The observed trends are in agreement with chemo-spectrophotometric models of spiral galaxy evolution based on CDM-motivated scaling laws but none of the hierarchical merging characteristics, implying a strong dependence of the star formation history of spiral galaxies on the galaxy potential and halo spin parameter. },

@article{Courteau:2003a,
	Abstract = {We present new data exploring the scaling relations, such as the Tully-Fisher relation (TFR), of bright barred and unbarred galaxies. A primary motivation for this study is to establish whether barredness correlates with, and is a consequence of, virial properties of galaxies. Various lines of evidence suggest that dark matter is dominant in disks of bright unbarred galaxies at 2.2 disk scale lengths, the point of peak rotation for a pure exponential disk. We test the hypothesis that the Tully-Fisher (TF) plane of barred high surface brightness galaxies is offset from the mean TFR of unbarred galaxies, as might be expected if barred galaxies are ``maximal'' in their inner parts. We use existing and new TF data to search for basic structural differences between barred and unbarred galaxies. Our new data consist of two-dimensional Halpha velocity fields derived from SparsePak integral field spectroscopy and V- and I-band CCD images collected at the WIYN Observatory2 for 14 strongly barred galaxies. Differences may exist between kinematic and photometric inclination angles of barred versus unbarred galaxies. These findings lead us to restrict our analysis to barred galaxies with i&gt;50<SUP>deg</SUP>. We use WIYN/SparsePak (two-dimensional) velocity fields to show that long-slit (one-dimensional) spectra yield reliable circular speed measurements at or beyond 2.2 disk scale lengths, far from any influence of the bar. This enables us to consider line width measurements from extensive TF surveys that include barred and nonbarred disks and derive detailed scaling relation comparisons. We find that for a given luminosity, barred and unbarred galaxies have comparable structural and dynamical parameters, such as peak velocities, scale lengths, and colors. In particular, the location of a galaxy in the TF plane is independent of barredness. In a global dynamical sense, barred and unbarred galaxies behave similarly and are likely to have, on average, comparable fractions of luminous and dark matter at a given radius. },

	Abstract = {Context: Planetary Nebulae (PNe) display complex radial surface brightness profiles whose understanding is crucial for a correct interpretation of their formation and evolution. In particular, the intermediate shells commonly observed around the bright rims of PNe contain important information for the discussion of the mass loss rate at the end of the AGB, for the determination of the post-AGB age of the central stars and the distance via the expansion parallax method, and for the analysis of line profiles for unresolved, faraway objects like extragalactic PNe.  Aims: This paper describes the dynamical properties of PNe shells and presents a new practical method to properly determine their expansion velocity.  Methods: The analysis is guided by realistic radiative-hydrodynamical simulations which allow to test and verify different methods for the kinematical study of PNe shells using high-resolution long-slit spectra.  Results: We show that the use of the derivative of the line profile allows us to determine accurately the post-shock gas velocity in the shells. This method is generally superior to other techniques previously used. In addition, if applied to long-slit data, it allows to determine the velocities of the shells even when they are very close to those of the PNe rims. Its application to 10 real PNe confirms the model predictions and previous conclusions about the substantial mass loss increase during the latest AGB evolution.  Conclusions: The method and discussion presented in this paper are meant to be used as a guide for a correct determination of some basic kinematic and evolutionary properties of Galactic and extragalactic PNe, including their expansion parallaxes.<p>  Based on observations obtained at the 3.5 m NTT and CAT telescopes of the European Southern Observatory in Chile, and at the 2.6 m NOT telescope operated by NOTSA in the Spanish Observatorio del Roque de Los Muchachos of the Instituto de Astrof&#237;sica de Canarias. },

The aim is to determine the chemical composition of this object. We also make use of IUE and ground based spectra. Abundances determined from the mid-infrared lines, which are insensitive to electron temperature, are used as the basis for the determination of the composition, which are found to differ somewhat from earlier results. The abundances found, especially the low value of helium and oxygen, indicate that the central star was originally of rather low mass. Abundances of phosphorus, iron, silicon and chlorine have been determined for the first time in this nebula. The variation of electron temperature in this nebula is very clear reaching quite high values close to the center. The temperature of the central star is discussed in the light of the high observed stages of ionization. The nebular information indicates the spectrum of the star deviates considerably from a blackbody. },

	Abstract = {The halo of NGC 891 has been the subject of studies for more than a decade. One of its most striking features is the large asymmetry in H-$\alpha$ emission. We have taken a quantitative look at this asymmetry at different wavelengths for the first time. We propose that NGC 891 is intrinsically almost symmetric, as seen in Spitzer observations, and the large asymmetry in H-$\alpha$ emission is mostly due to dust attenuation. We quantify the additional optical depth needed to cause the observed H-$\alpha$ asymmetry. A comparison of large strips on the North East side of the galaxy with strips covering the same area in the South West we can quantify and analyze the asymmetry in the different wavelengths. From the 24 $\mu$m emission we find that the intrinsic asymmetry in star-formation in NGC 891 is small i.e., approximately 30%. The additional asymmetry in H-alpha is modeled as additional symmetric dust attenuation which extends up to ~ 40'' (1.9 kpc) above the plane of the galaxy with a mid-plane value of $\tau$=0.8 and a scale height of 0.5 kpc. This observational technique offers the possibility to quantify the effects of vertical ISM disk stability as an explanation for dust lanes in massive galaxies Dalcanton et al. (2004). },

Using HST/ACS archival images of the nearby galaxy IC2574, we performed stellar PSF photometry and selected the most massive stars as our first test sample.

We then plot the color-magnitude diagrams for each group, and use stellar evolutionary models to estimate their age. So far, we found 79 groups with ages of up to about 100 Myr, displaying various sizes and densities. },

	Abstract = {If the mass loss rate, dot {M}, or the modified wind momentum, Pi , of central stars of planetary nebulae (CSPN) is strictly related to the luminosity, the study of their winds can be used to derive their distance as suggested in the literature. However, the mass loss rates and modified wind momenta of a sample of 13 CSPN published in the literature show a separation into two groups, which differ by a factor 10 to 10<SUP>2</SUP> in Pi . This is partly, but not completely, due to differences in the adopted methods for mass loss determinations, and partly due to differences in the adopted stellar parameters, mainly the effective temperature. We have adopted a homogeneous set of stellar parameters, based on the Zanstra method, the dynamical ages of the nebulae and on evolutionary tracks, and scaled the mass loss rates accordingly. The revised data show that there is a large jump in dot {M} and Pi near T<SUB>eff</SUB> =~ 60 000 K, with dot {M} and Pi being larger by a factor 10 to 10<SUP>2</SUP> for the cooler group of CSPN of spectral type Of, than for the hotter group of type O. This discontinuity is most likely due to a bi-stability jump. The revised data do not show a clear relation between Pi and the luminosity. The consequences are discussed in terms of the post-AGB evolution theory and the radiation driven wind models. },

	Abstract = {We present new full-sky temperature and polarization maps in five frequency bands from 23 to 94 GHz, based on data from the first five years of the WMAP sky survey. The five-year maps incorporate several improvements in data processing made possible by the additional years of data and by a more complete analysis of the instrument calibration and in-flight beam response. We present several new tests for systematic errors in the polarization data and conclude that Ka band data (33 GHz) is suitable for use in cosmological analysis, after foreground cleaning. This significantly reduces the overall polarization uncertainty. With the 5 year WMAP data, we detect no convincing deviations from the minimal 6-parameter LCDM model: a flat universe dominated by a cosmological constant, with adiabatic and nearly scale-invariant Gaussian fluctuations. Using WMAP data combined with measurements of Type Ia supernovae and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, we find (68% CL uncertainties): Omega_bh^2 = 0.02265 \pm 0.00059, Omega_ch^2 = 0.1143 \pm 0.0034, Omega_Lambda = 0.721 \pm 0.015, n_s = 0.960 \pm 0.014, tau = 0.084 \pm 0.016, and Delta_R^2 = (2.457 \pm 0.093) x 10^-9. From these we derive: sigma_8 = 0.817 \pm 0.026, H_0 = 70.1 \pm 1.3 km/s/Mpc, z_{reion} = 10.8 \pm 1.4, and t_0 = 13.73 \pm 0.12 Gyr. The new limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio is r &lt; 0.20 (95% CL). We obtain tight, simultaneous limits on the (constant) dark energy equation of state and spatial curvature: -0.11 &lt; 1+w &lt; 0.14 and -0.0175 &lt; Omega_k &lt; 0.0085 (both 95% CL). The number of relativistic degrees of freedom (e.g. neutrinos) is found to be N_{eff} = 4.4 \pm 1.5, consistent with the standard value of 3.04. Models with N_{eff} = 0 are disfavored at &gt;99.5% confidence. },

	Abstract = {The precise analysis of properties of planetary nebulae is strongly dependent on good models for the stellar ionizing spectrum. Observations in the UV - X-ray wavelength range as well as NLTE model atmosphere calculations of spectra of their exciting stars have shown that neither blackbody fluxes nor ``standard'' NLTE atmosphere models which are composed out of hydrogen and helium only are good approximations. Strong differences between synthetic spectra from these compared to observed spectra at energies higher than 54 eV (\He 2 ground state) can be ascribed to the neglect of metal-line blanketing.<p>  Realistic modeling of the emergent fluxes of hot stars in the UV - X-ray wavelength range requires metal-line blanketed NLTE model atmospheres which include all elements from hydrogen up to the iron-group. For this purpose, we present a grid (solar and halo abundance ratios) of metal-line blanketed NLTE model atmosphere fluxes which covers the parameter range of central stars of planetary nebulae. },

	Abstract = {We measure the mass function of dark matter halos in a large set of collisionless cosmological simulations of flat LCDM cosmology and investigate its evolution at z&lt;~2. Halos are identified as isolated density peaks, and their masses are measured within a series of radii enclosing specific overdensities. We argue that these spherical overdensity masses are more directly linked to cluster observables than masses measured using the friends-of-friends algorithm (FOF), and are therefore preferable for accurate forecasts of halo abundances. Our simulation set allows us to calibrate the mass function at z=0 for virial masses in the range 10^{11} Msol/h &lt; M &lt; 10^{15} Msol/h, to &lt;~ 5%. We derive fitting functions for the halo mass function in this mass range for a wide range of overdensities, both at z=0 and earlier epochs. In addition to these formulae, which improve on previous approximations by 10-20%, our main finding is that the mass function cannot be represented by a universal fitting function at this level of accuracy. The amplitude of the "universal" function decreases monotonically by ~20-50%, depending on the mass definition, from z=0 to 2.5. We also find evidence for redshift evolution in the overall shape of the mass function. },

	Abstract = {An all-high-latitude sky survey for cool carbon giant stars in the Galactic halo has revealed 75 such stars, of which the majority are new detections. Of these, more than half are clustered on a great circle on the sky that intersects the center of Sagittarius dwarf galaxy and is parallel to its proper-motion vector, while many of the remainder are outlying Magellanic Cloud carbon stars. Previous numerical experiments regarding the disruption of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (the closest of the Galactic satellite galaxies) predicted that the effect of the strong tides, during its repeated close encounters with the Milky Way, would be to slowly disrupt that galaxy. Because of the small velocity dispersion of the disrupted particles, these disperse slowly along (approximately) the orbital path of the progenitor, eventually giving rise to a very long stream of tidal debris surrounding our Galaxy. The more recently disrupted fragments of this stream should contain a mix of stellar populations similar to that found in the progenitor, which includes giant carbon stars. Given the measured position and velocity of the Sagittarius dwarf, we first integrate its orbit assuming a standard spherical model for the Galactic potential and find both that the path of the orbit intersects the position of the stream and that the radial velocity of the orbit, as viewed from the solar position, agrees very well with the observed radial velocities of the carbon stars. We also present a pole-count analysis of the carbon star distribution, which clearly indicates that the great circle stream we have isolated is statistically significant, being a 5-6 sigma overdensity. These two arguments strongly support our conclusion that a large fraction of the halo carbon stars originated in the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. The stream orbits the Galaxy between the present location of the Sagittarius dwarf, 16 kpc from the Galactic center, and the most distant stream carbon star, at ~60 kpc. It follows neither a polar nor a Galactic plane orbit, so that a large range in both Galactic R- and z-distances is probed. That the stream is observed as a great circle indicates that the Galaxy does not exert a significant torque on the stream, so the Galactic potential must be nearly spherical in the regions probed by the stream. Furthermore, the radial mass distribution of the halo must allow a particle at the position and with the velocity of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy to reach the distance of the furthest stream carbon stars. Thus, the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy tidal stream gives a very powerful means to constrain the mass distribution it resides in, that is, the dark halo. We present N-body experiments simulating this disruption process as a function of the distribution of mass in the Galactic halo. A likelihood analysis shows that, in the Galactocentric distance range 16 kpc&lt;R&lt;60 kpc, the dark halo is most likely almost spherical. We rule out, at high confidence levels, the possibility that the halo is significantly oblate, with isodensity contours of aspect q<SUB>m</SUB>&lt;0.7. This result is quite unexpected and contests currently popular galaxy formation models. },

@article{Hogan:1999,
	Abstract = {The Cold Dark Matter paradigm successfully explains many phenomena on scales larger than galaxies, but seems to predict galaxy halos which are more centrally concentrated and have a lumpier substructure than observed. Endowing cosmic dark matter with a small primordial velocity dispersion preserves the successful predictions of the Cold Dark Matter scenario on large scales and improves the agreement with halo structure. A ``phase density'' $Q$, proportional to the inverse entropy for nonrelativistic matter, is estimated for relativistically decoupled thermal or degenerate relic particles of mass $m_X$, with a numerical factor depending on the particle type but no cosmological parameters. Since $Q$ cannot increase for dissipationless, collisionless matter, at a given velocity dispersion there is a maximum space density; this ``phase packing'' constraint eliminates the singular density predicted by CDM. The core radius and halo circular velocity scale analogously to degenerate dwarf stars. Particle velocities also filter primordial perturbations on a scale depending on $Q$ and on details of particle distributions. Particle candidates for warm matter are briefly discussed; for warm thermal relics to have the observed mass density requires decoupling prior to the QCD epoch and therefore a superweak interaction with thermal Standard Model particles. },

We derive their distances from the luminosity of the tip of the red giant branch stars with a typical accuracy of  ~ 12%. The resulting distances are 3.9 Mpc (UGC 6541), 4.9 Mpc (NGC 3738), 3.0 Mpc (NGC 3741), 4.5 Mpc (KK 109), &gt;6.3 Mpc (NGC 4150), 4.2 Mpc (UGC 7298), 4.5 Mpc (NGC 4244), 4.6 Mpc (NGC 4395), 4.9 Mpc (UGC 7559), 4.2 Mpc (NGC 4449), 4.4 Mpc (UGC 7605), 4.6 Mpc (IC 3687), 4.7 Mpc (KK 166), 4.7 Mpc (NGC 4736), 4.2 Mpc (UGC 8308), 4.3 Mpc (UGC 8320), 4.6 Mpc (NGC 5204), and 3.2 Mpc (UGC 8833). The CVn I cloud has a mean radial velocity of 286 +/- 9 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, a mean distance of 4.1 +/- 0.2 Mpc, a radial velocity dispersion of 50 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, a mean projected radius of 760 kpc, and a total blue luminosity of 2.2 x 10<SUP>10</SUP> L<SUB>sun </SUB>. Assuming virial or closed orbital motions for the galaxies, we estimated their virial and their orbital mass-to-luminosity ratio to be 176 and 88 M<SUB>sun </SUB>/L<SUB>sun </SUB> , respectively. However, the CVn I cloud is characterized by a crossing time of 15 Gyr, and is thus far from a state of dynamical equilibrium. The large crossing time for the cloud, its low content of dSph galaxies (&lt;6%), and the almost ``primordial'' shape of its luminosity function show that the CVn I complex is in a transient dynamical state, driven rather by the free Hubble expansion than by galaxy interactions.<p>  Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope.

	Abstract = {We present evidence that the infant mortality of stellar clusters is likely to be a major and very efficient process for the dissolution of young clusters in the spiral galaxy NGC 1313. Performing stellar PSF photometry on archival HST/ACS images of the galaxy, we find that a large fraction of early B-type stars are seen outside of star clusters and well spread within the galactic disk, consistent with the scenario of infant mortality. We also calculate the UV flux produced by the stars in and out of the clusters and find that 75%-90% of the UV flux in NGC 1313 is produced by stars outside the clusters. These results suggest that the infant mortality of star clusters is probably the underlying cause of the diffuse UV emission in starburst galaxies. Infant mortality would also explain the numerous B-type stars observed in the background field of our Galaxy as well. We exclude the possibility that unresolved low-mass star clusters and scaled OB associations might be the main sources for the diffuse UV emission. },

	Abstract = {We present kinematic measurements of the thick and thin disks in two edge-on galaxies. We have derived stellar rotation curves at and above the galaxies' midplanes using Ca II triplet features measured with the GMOS spectrograph on Gemini North. In one galaxy, FGC 1415, the kinematics above the plane shows clear rotation that lags that of the midplane by ~20%-50%, similar to the behavior seen in the Milky Way. However, the kinematics of the second galaxy, FGC 227, is quite different. The rotation above the plane is extremely slow, showing &lt;~25% of the rotation speed of the stars at the midplane. We decompose the observed rotation curves into a superposition of thick- and thin-disk kinematics, using two-dimensional fits to the galaxy images to determine the fraction of thick-disk stars at each position. We find that the thick disk of FGC 1415 rotates at 30%-40% of the rotation speed of the thin disk. In contrast, the thick disk of FGC 227 is very likely counterrotating if it is rotating at all. These observations are consistent with the velocity dispersion profiles that we measure for each galaxy. The detection of counterrotating thick disks conclusively rules out models in which the thick disk forms either during monolithic collapse or from vertical heating of an earlier thin disk. Instead, the data strongly support models in which the thick disk forms from direct accretion of stars from infalling satellites. },

	Abstract = {I briefly review the growing evidence that thick stellar disks surround most edgeon disk galaxies. Recent studies show that these extragalactic thick disks have old ages, low metallicities, long scale lengths, and moderately flattened axial ratios, much like the thick disk of the MilkyWay. However, the properties of thick disks change systematically with the mass of the galaxy. The thick disks of low mass galaxies are more prominent and somewhat more metal-poor than those surrounding massive disk galaxies. Given the strong evidence that thick disks are fossils from an early epoch of merging, these trends place tight constraints on the early assembly of disk galaxies. },

	Abstract = {We present "The HI Nearby Galaxy Survey (THINGS)", a high spectral (&lt;=5.2 km/s) and spatial (~6") resolution survey of HI emission in 34 nearby galaxies obtained using the NRAO Very Large Array (VLA). The overarching scientific goal of THINGS is to investigate fundamental characteristics of the interstellar medium (ISM) related to galaxy morphology, star formation and mass distribution across the Hubble sequence. Unique characteristics of the THINGS database are the homogeneous sensitivity as well as spatial and velocity resolution of the HI data which is at the limit of what can be achieved with the VLA for a significant number of galaxies. A sample of 34 objects at distances 2&lt;D&lt;15Mpc (resulting in linear resolutions of ~100 to 500pc) are targeted in THINGS, covering a wide range of star formation rates (10^-3 to 6 M_sun/yr), total HI masses M_HI (0.01 to 14x10^9 M_sun), absolute luminosities M_B (-11.5 to -21.7 mag) and metallicities (7.5 to 9.2 in units of 12+log[O/H]). We describe the setup of the VLA observations, the data reduction procedures and the creation of the final THINGS data products. We present an atlas of the integrated HI maps, the velocity fields, the second moment (velocity dispersion) maps and individual channel maps of each THINGS galaxy. The THINGS data products are made publicly available through a dedicated webpage. Accompanying THINGS papers address issues such as the small-scale structure of the ISM, the (dark) matter distribution in THINGS galaxies, and the processes leading to star formation. },

	Abstract = {We describe a new radial velocity survey of T Tauri stars and present the first results. Our search is motivated by an interest in detecting massive young planets, as well as investigating the origin of the brown dwarf desert. As part of this survey, we discovered large-amplitude, periodic, radial velocity variations in the spectrum of the weak-line T Tauri star LkCa 19. Using line bisector analysis and a new simulation of the effect of starspots on the photometric and radial velocity variability of T Tauri stars, we show that our measured radial velocities for LkCa 19 are fully consistent with variations caused by the presence of large starspots on this rapidly rotating young star. These results illustrate the level of activity-induced radial velocity noise associated with at least some very young stars. This activity-induced noise will set lower limits on the mass of a companion detectable around LkCa 19 and similarly active young stars. },

@article{Herbst:2008,
	Abstract = {In the standard model of terrestrial planet formation, the first step in the process is for interstellar dust to coagulate within a protoplanetary disk surrounding a young star, forming large grains that settle towards the disk plane. Interstellar grains of typical size ~0.1mum are expected to grow to millimetre- (sand), centimetre- (pebble) or even metre-sized (boulder) objects rather quickly. Unfortunately, such evolved disks are hard to observe because the ratio of surface area to volume of their constituents is small. We readily detect dust around young objects known as `classical' T Tauri stars, but there is little or no evidence of it in the slightly more evolved `weak-line' systems. Here we report observations of a 3-Myr-old star, which show that grains have grown to about millimetre size or larger in the terrestrial zone (within ~3AU) of this star. The fortuitous geometry of the KH 15D binary star system allows us to infer that, when both stars are occulted by the surrounding disk, it appears as a nearly edge-on ring illuminated by one of the central binary components. This work complements the study of terrestrial zones of younger disks that have been recently resolved by interferometry. },

	Abstract = {We report new magnetic field measurements for 14 classical T Tauri stars (CTTSs). We combine these data with one previous field determination in order to compare our observed field strengths with the field strengths predicted by magnetospheric accretion models. We use literature data on the stellar mass, radius, rotation period, and disk accretion rate to predict the field strength that should be present on each of our stars according to these magnetospheric accretion models. We show that our measured field values do not correlate with the field strengths predicted by simple magnetospheric accretion theory. We also use our field strength measurements and literature X-ray luminosity data to test a recent relationship expressing X-ray luminosity as a function of surface magnetic flux derived from various solar feature and main-sequence star measurements. We find that the T Tauri stars we have observed have weaker than expected X-ray emission by over an order of magnitude on average using this relationship. We suggest the cause for this is actually a result of the very strong fields on these stars, which decreases the efficiency with which gas motions in the photosphere can tangle magnetic flux tubes in the corona. },

	Abstract = {We present high-resolution (R~60,000) circular spectropolarimetry of the classical T Tauri star TW Hydrae. We analyze 12 photospheric absorption lines and measure the net longitudinal magnetic field for six consecutive nights. While no net polarization is detected the first five nights, a significant photospheric field of B<SUB>z</SUB>=149+/-33 G is found on the sixth night. To rule out spurious instrumental polarization, we apply the same analysis technique to several nonmagnetic telluric lines, detecting no significant polarization. We further demonstrate the reality of this field detection by showing that the splitting between right and left polarized components in these 12 photospheric lines shows a linear trend with Land&#233; g-factor times wavelength squared, as predicted by the Zeeman effect. However, this longitudinal field detection is still much lower than that which would result if a pure dipole magnetic geometry is responsible for the mean magnetic field strength of 2.6 kG previously reported for TW Hya. We also detect strong circular polarization in the He I lambda5876 and Ca II lambda8498 emission lines, indicating a strong field in the line formation region of these features. The polarization of the Ca II line is substantially weaker than that of the He I line, which we interpret as being due to a larger contribution to the Ca II line from chromospheric emission in which the polarization signals cancel. However, the presence of polarization in the Ca II line indicates that accretion shocks on classical T Tauri stars do produce narrow emission features in the infrared triplet lines of calcium. },

	Abstract = {It has recently been suggested that the winds from classical T Tauri stars in general, and the wind from TW Hya in particular, reaches temperatures of 300,000 K while maintaining a mass-loss rate of ~10<SUP>-11</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP> or larger. If confirmed, this would place strong new requirements on wind launching and heating models. We therefore reexamine spectra from the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph aboard the Hubble Space Telescope and spectra from the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer satellite in an effort to better constrain the maximum temperature in the wind of TW Hya. We find clear evidence for a wind in the C II doublet at 1037 &#197; and in the C II multiplet at 1335 &#197;. We find no wind absorption in the C IV lambda1550 doublet observed at the same time as the C II lambda1335 line or in observations of O VI observed simultaneously with the C II lambda1037 line. The presence or absence of C III wind absorption is ambiguous. The clear lack of a wind in the C IV line argues that the wind from TW Hya does not reach the 100,000 K characteristic formation temperature of this line. We therefore argue that the available evidence suggests that the wind from TW Hya, and perhaps all classical T Tauri stars, reaches a maximum temperature in the range of 10,000-30,000 K.<p>  This work is based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555. These observations are associated with program GTO-7718. This work is also based on observations made with the NASA/CNES/CSA Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer, which is operated for NASA by the Johns Hopkins University under NASA contract NAS5-32985. },

	Abstract = {High-resolution (R~60,000) circular spectropolarimetry of the classical T Tauri star T Tau is presented. The star was observed on 1997 November 21 and 22. Analyzing 12 photospheric absorption lines, the mean longitudinal magnetic field is found to be B<SUB>z</SUB>=12+/-35 G. The 3 sigma upper limit of |B<SUB>z</SUB>|&lt;=105 G. Previously, T Tau was reported to have a mean longitudinal field of 160+/-40 G. A strong mean magnetic field (~2.4 kG) has been reported on the surface of T Tau based on Zeeman broadening measurements in unpolarized light. The present observations indicate that it is very unlikely that this field is dipolar in nature. In order to verify the observing techniques and analysis methods used on T Tau, spectra of the Sun obtained by observing the asteroid Vesta are analyzed in the same fashion. Here the mean longitudinal field is B<SUB>z</SUB>=-4+/-3 G, which is well within the limits of previous observations. As a further check on our results, we also present data for the magnetic Ap star 53 Cam, which gives a mean longitudinal magnetic field that agrees well with the published field variations for this star. },

	Abstract = {We present infrared (IR) and optical echelle spectra of the classical T Tauri star TW Hydrae. Using the optical data, we perform detailed spectrum synthesis to fit atomic and molecular absorption lines and determine key stellar parameters: T<SUB>eff</SUB>=4126+/-24 K, logg=4.84+/-0.16, [M/H]=-0.10+/-0.12, and logg=5.8+/-0.6 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. The IR spectrum is used to look for Zeeman broadening of photospheric absorption lines. We fit four Zeeman-sensitive Ti I lines near 2.2 mum and find that the average value of the magnetic field over the entire surface is B=2.61+/-0.23 kG. In addition, several nearby magnetically insensitive CO lines show no excess broadening above that produced by stellar rotation and instrumental broadening, reinforcing the magnetic interpretation for the width of the Ti I lines. We carry out extensive tests to quantify systematic errors in our analysis technique that may result from inaccurate knowledge of the effective temperature or gravity, finding that reasonable errors in these quantities produce a ~10% uncertainty in the mean field measurement. },

	Abstract = {High-resolution optical and infrared (IR) echelle spectra of the naked (diskless) T Tauri star Hubble 4 are presented. The K-band IR spectra include four Zeeman-sensitive Ti I lines along with several magnetically insensitive CO lines. Detailed spectrum synthesis combined with modern atmospheric models is used to fit the optical spectra of Hubble 4 in order to determine its key stellar parameters: T<SUB>eff</SUB>=4158+/-56 K; logg=3.61+/-0.50 [M/H]=-0.08+/-0.05 vsini=14.6+/-1.7 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. These stellar parameters are used to synthesize K-band spectra to compare with the observations. The magnetically sensitive Ti I lines are all significantly broadened relative to the lines produced in the nonmagnetic model, while the magnetically insensitive CO lines are well matched by the basic nonmagnetic model. Models with magnetic fields are synthesized and fitted to the Ti I lines. The best-fit models indicate a distribution of magnetic field strengths on the stellar surface characterized by a mean magnetic field strength of 2.51+/-0.18 kG. The mean field is a factor of 2.0 greater than the maximum field strength predicted by pressure equipartition arguments. To confirm the reality of such strong fields, we attempt to refit the observed profiles using a two-component magnetic model in which the field strength is confined to the equipartition value representing plagelike regions in one component and the field is allowed to vary in a cooler component representing spots. It is shown that such a model is inconsistent with the optical spectrum of the TiO bandhead at 7055 &#197;. },

@article{McKee:2007,
	Abstract = {We review current understanding of star formation, outlining an overall theoretical framework and the observations that motivate it. A conception of star formation has emerged in which turbulence plays a dual role, both creating overdensities to initiate gravitational contraction or collapse, and countering the effects of gravity in these overdense regions. The key dynamical processes involved in star formation---turbulence, magnetic fields, and self-gravity---are highly nonlinear and multidimensional. Physical arguments are used to identify and explain the features and scalings involved in star formation, and results from numerical simulations are used to quantify these effects. We divide star formation into large-scale and small-scale regimes and review each in turn. Large scales range from galaxies to giant molecular clouds (GMCs) and their substructures. Important problems include how GMCs form and evolve, what determines the star formation rate (SFR), and what determines the initial mass function (IMF). Small scales range from dense cores to the protostellar systems they beget. We discuss formation of both low- and high-mass stars, including ongoing accretion. The development of winds and outflows is increasingly well understood, as are the mechanisms governing angular momentum transport in disks. Although outstanding questions remain, the framework is now in place to build a comprehensive theory of star formation that will be tested by the next generation of telescopes. },

	Abstract = {We obtained high-resolution, high-quality VLT/UVES spectra to reconstruct the two-dimensional surface structure of the rapidly-rotating classical T-Tauri star MN Lupi on two separate nights. Both surface maps show a structured warm (5000 K) band centered around the pole at a latitude of &ap;65&deg;. Located within the band are two hot spots with temperatures of approximately or possibly even in excess of 5800 K, i.e. 2000 K above the effective photospheric temperature. Both maps appear with an adjacent equatorial band of temperature 3400 K, some 400-500 K below the effective photospheric temperature. While we interpret the two hot spots and the warm high-latitude band to be the heating points from two accretion impacts at the time of our observations and their redistributed energy trailed due to the fast stellar rotation, respectively, the cool equatorial band may not be cool after all but due to obscuration of the stellar surface by the innermost region of the disk. The fact that the hot spots appear at high stellar latitude is in agreement with the magnetospheric accretion model that proposes material funnelling onto the star along a predominantly dipolar magnetic field at roughly 50&deg; latitude. The evidence of ongoing disk accretion, together with the very fast rotation of MN Lupi of just 3-4 times below its break-up velocity, suggests that the accretion mechanism is the cause of its rapid surface rotation. We present a model of magnetic star-disk coupling for MN Lupi that predicts a polar surface magnetic field of &ap;3 kG. },

	Abstract = {Establishing the origin of accretion powered winds from forming stars is critical for understanding angular momentum evolution in the star-disk interaction region. Here, the high velocity component of accretion powered winds is launched and accreting stars are spun down, in defiance of the expected spin-up during magnetospheric accretion. T Tauri stars in the final stage of disk accretion offer a unique opportunity to study the connection between accretion and winds and their relation to stellar spindown. Although spectroscopic indicators of high velocity T Tauri winds have been known for decades, the line of He I 10830 offers a promising new diagnostic to probe the magnetically controlled star-disk interaction and wind-launching region. The high opacity and resonance scattering properties of this line offer a powerful probe of the geometry of both the funnel flow and the inner wind that, together with other atomic and molecular spectral lines covering a wide range of excitation and ionization states, suggests that the magnetic interaction between the star and disk, and the subsequent launching of the inner high velocity wind, is sensitive to the disk accretion rate. },

	Abstract = {We report the results of a spectroscopic survey of 20 close T Tauri binaries in the Taurus-Auriga dark cloud where the separations between primaries and their secondaries are less than the typical size of a circumstellar disk around a young star. Analysis of low- and medium-resolution Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph spectra yields the stellar luminosities, reddenings, ages, masses, mass accretion rates, IR excesses, and emission-line luminosities for each star in each pair. We examine the ability of IR color excesses, Halpha equivalent widths, [O I] emission, and veiling to distinguish between weak emission and classical T Tauri stars. Four pairs have one classical T Tauri star (CTTS) and one weak-lined T Tauri star (WTTS); the CTTS is the primary in three of these systems. This frequency of mixed pairs among the close T Tauri binaries is similar to the frequency of mixed pairs in wider young binaries. Extinctions within pairs are usually similar; however, the secondary is more heavily reddened than the primary in some systems, where it may be viewed through the primary's disk. Mass accretion rates of primaries and secondaries are strongly correlated, and Halpha luminosities, IR excesses, and ages also correlate within pairs. Primaries tend to have somewhat larger accretion rates than their secondaries do and are typically slightly older than their secondaries according to three different sets of modern pre-main-sequence evolutionary tracks. Age differences for XZ Tau and FS Tau, systems embedded in reflection nebulae, are striking: the secondary in each pair is less massive but more luminous than the primary. The stellar masses of the UY Aur and GG Tau binaries measured from their rotating molecular disks are about 30% larger than the masses inferred from the spectra and evolutionary tracks. This discrepancy can be resolved in several ways, among them a 10% closer distance for the Taurus-Auriga dark cloud.<p>  Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555. },

	Abstract = {We probe the geometry of magnetospheric accretion in classical T Tauri stars (CTTSs) by modeling red absorption at He I lambda10830 via scattering of the stellar and veiling continua. Under the assumptions that the accretion flow is an azimuthally symmetric dipole and helium is sufficiently optically thick that all incident 1 mum radiation is scattered, we illustrate the sensitivity of He I lambda10830 red absorption to both the size of the magnetosphere and the filling factor of the hot accretion shock. We compare model profiles to those observed in 21 CTTSs with subcontinuum redshifted absorption at He I lambda10830 and find that about half of the stars have red absorption and 1 mum veilings that are consistent with dipole flows of moderate width with accretion shock filling factors matching the size of the magnetospheric footpoints. However, the remaining 50% of the profiles, with a combination of broad, deep absorption and low 1 mum veiling, require very wide flows where magnetic footpoints are distributed over 10%-20% of the stellar surface but accretion shock filling factors are &lt;1%. We model these profiles by invoking large magnetospheres dilutely filled with accreting gas, leaving the disk over a range of radii in many narrow ``streamlets'' that fill only a small fraction of the entire infall region. In some cases accreting streamlets need to originate in the disk between several R<SUB>*</SUB> and at least the corotation radius. A few stars have such deep absorption at velocities &gt;0.5V<SUB>esc</SUB> that flows near the star with less curvature than a dipole trajectory seem to be required. },

	Abstract = {Aims.We examine whether ejection phenomena from accreting T Tauri stars can be described by only one type of self-collimated jet model.<BR /> Methods: .We present analytical kinematic predictions valid soon after the Alfv&#233;n surface for all types of steady magnetically self-confined jets.<BR /> Results: .We show that extended disc winds, X-winds, and stellar winds occupy distinct regions in the poloidal speed vs. specific angular momentum plane. Comparisons with current observations of T Tauri jets yield quantitative constraints on the range of launching radii, magnetic lever arms, and specific energy input in disc and stellar winds. Implications on the origin of jet asymmetries and disc magnetic fields are outlined.<BR /> Conclusions: .We argue that ejection phenomena from accreting T Tauri stars most likely include three dynamical components: (1) an outer self-collimated steady disc wind carrying most of the mass-flux in the optical jet (when present); confining (2) a pressure-driven coronal stellar wind; and (3) a hot inner flow made of blobs sporadically ejected from the magnetopause. If the stellar magnetic moment is parallel to the disc magnetic field, then the highly variable inner flow resembles a "Reconnection X-wind", that has been proven to efficiently brake down an accreting and contracting young star. If the magnetic moment is anti-parallel, then larger versions of the solar coronal mass ejections are likely to occur. The relative importance of these three components in the observed outflows and the range of radii involved in the disc wind are expected to vary with time, from the stage of embedded source to the optically revealed T Tauri star phase. },

	Abstract = {We present the mechanical and opto-mechanical design for the Prototype Visible Integral-Field Unit Spectrograph (VIRUS-P). The VIRUS-P instrument is the single unit prototype for the planned VIRUS instrument which consists of 192 spectrographs for the Hobby Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX). The VIRUS Prototype is a test bed for the design and will be used for a survey on the McDonald 2.7m Harlan J. Smith Telescope. The mechanical design is driven by the need for high stability. The structure of the instrument is aluminum but the internal optical elements of the collimator and the camera are held in alignment with respect to each other using Invar metering rods. The spectrograph is fiber fed with 246 fibers in a hexagonal packing pattern at the telescope focal plane Integral Field Unit (IFU) and arranged in a slit at the input to the spectrograph. The reverse-Schmidt collimator articulates, and the Volume Phase Holographic (VPH) grating rotates independently relative to the fixed Schmidt camera to allow for versatile grating configurations during the prototype testing. Since the VIRUS spectrograph units will be mounted in a gravity neutral configuration on the HET, the prototype instrument is mounted on a gimbal at the folded cassegrain port of the 2.7m Smith Telescope to negate gravity vector changes. },

	Abstract = {We have carried out a concept study for a wide-field monolithic integral field unit (IFU) spectrograph for extremely large telescopes (ELTs). We target in this paper the technological challenges that have to be faced in order to build such an instrument, focusing on the adaptive optics (AO) requirements, the image slicer technology, and the detectors status. We also address the main science drivers, together with the concept design and the expected performance applied to the European-ELT (E-ELT) case. A monolithic wide-field spectrograph provides a continuous field of view (FOV) separated by a field splitter in several subfields, each of them feeding a module featuring an image slicer, a collimator and a spectrograph. The use of image slicers provides 3D spectrographic images of the complete FOV, allowing for detection and study of sources without need of targeting them, a very useful property especially for the deep observation of faint high-redshift objects, whose density on the sky is expected to be quite high. In light of this discussion, we suggest the advantages of using shorter wavelengths and its implication in both the scientific program and the budget. },

	Abstract = {The new design of image slicer developed at Durham University for 2D area spectroscopy is described. The unit acts as a coupler between the telescope and a spectrograph to reformat a square or rectangular field into a long slit. Its advantages over previous designs of image slicers and other methods using fibers, lenses or narrow-band filtering are discussed, mainly: large field, high spatial resolution, large number of spectral resolution elements, high transmission, and the small size of the instrument. The system is also easy to cool and is then well suited for IR spectroscopy. The proposed design is a new type of image slicer in which the original 2D image is sliced into narrow sub-images that are re-imaged side by side to form a long 1D image at the spectrograph input. The flexibility of the concept at the base of this new design is highlighted through the description of 5 different slicer designs. Three of these are for future instruments now at the design phase: the CGS4 slicer, the UIST slicer and the GNIRS slicer; the two others are studies for possible future slicers on GMOS and NGST. These designs show how easily our slicer can be added to an existing instrument, how it can be incorporated to the slit wheel of future instruments, and how multi-slit reformatting permits a much larger field of view. },

	Abstract = {The Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) is a second-generation VLT panoramic integral-field spectrograph presently under preliminary design study. MUSE has a field of 1 &#215; 1 arcmin2 sampled at 0.2 &#215; 0.2 arcsec2 and is assisted by the VLT ground layer adaptive optics ESO facility using four laser guide stars. The simultaneous spectral range is 0.465-0.93 mum, at a resolution of R ~ 3000. MUSE couples the discovery potential of a large imaging device to the measuring capabilities of a high-quality spectrograph, while taking advantage of the increased spatial resolution provided by adaptive optics.

	Abstract = {We describe the principle of integral field spectrographs employing fiber-lenslet technology. By reference to instruments which we are constructing, we estimate the spatial and spectral resolution that can be obtained. We show that overlapping between light from adjacent elements at the slit, which is desirable in order to maximize the number of elements and hence the field size, has negligible effect on resolution. We describe different strategies for background subtraction, taking account of the special characteristics of this type of system and compensating for manufacturing defects. We also show how background subtraction may be done when an adaptive optics system is used to feed the integral field spectrograph. We show how these principles have been applied to a fiber-lenslet design for the integral field unit of the GEMINI Multiobject Spectrographs and related instruments. },

	Abstract = {Integral field spectroscopy is a powerful tool for astronomical observation, of particular importance to large telescopes. In this paper, different techniques for the design and construction of integral field units (IFUs) are described, concentrating on the use of lenslet arrays coupled to fibers. The theory of the design of the foreoptics, lenslets, and fibers is presented. The effects of the fiber oversizing and focal ratio degradation on IFU performance are described. A mathematical model is developed that can be used to calculate the optimized fiber core size according to the required coupling efficiency. A figure of merit for the IFU system is also derived, which can be used to estimate and compare the performance of different IFU systems. Finally, a design example is given to demonstrate the applications of this theory. },

@article{Allington-Smith:2007,
	Abstract = {One of the problems of producing spectrographs for Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs) is that the beam size is required to scale with telescope aperture if all other parameters are held constant, leading to enormous size and implied cost. This is a particular problem for image sizes much larger than the diffraction limit, as is likely to be the case if Adaptive Optics systems are not initially able to deliver highly corrected images over the full field of the instrument or if signal/noise considerations require large spatial samples. In this case, there is a potential advantage in image slicing to reduce the effective slitwidth and hence the beam size. However, this implies larger detectors and oversizing of the optics which may cancel out the advantage. By the means of a toy model of a spectrograph whose dimensions are calibrated using existing instruments, the size and relative cost of spectrographs for ELTs have been estimated. Using a range of scaling laws derived from the reference instruments, it is possible to estimate the uncertainties in the predictions and to explore the consequences of different design strategies. The model predicts major cost savings (2-100&#215;) by slicing with factors of 5-20 depending on the type of spectrograph. The predictions suggest that it is better to accommodate the multiplicity of slices within a single spectrograph rather than distribute them among smaller, cheaper replicas in a parallel architecture, but the replication option provides an attractive upgrade path to integral field spectroscopy (IFS) as the input image quality is improved. Another major issue is whether the camera speed should be adapted to minimize the cost of the detector, or conversely, the camera simplified by means of redundant oversampling which requires larger detector formats. This tradeoff is the main reason for the minimum in the size and cost predictions for moderate slicing. },

The intention of PPak is to provide a large integral field-of-view in combination with a large collecting area per fiber for the study of extended low-surface brightness objects. The PPak system consists of a focal reducer lens and a fiber bundle, featuring an innovative design with object, sky and calibration fibers. With a field-of-view of 74 x 65 arcseconds, PPak currently is the world's widest integral field unit that provides a semi-contiguous regular sampling of extended astronomical objects. Its pre-optics and fiber-diameter, combined with the versatility and efficiency of the PMAS spectrograph, allows PPak to make a unique trade-off between total light-collecting power and spectral resolution. },

	Abstract = {PMAS is a versatile integral field spectrograph based on the principle of a fiber-coupled lens array type of IFU. The instrument was commissioned at the Calar Alto 3.5m Telescope in May 2001. PMAS is offered as a common user instrument at Calar Alto since 2002. However, it has remained flexible enough to be used as a testbed for new observing techniques. Since the instrument is sensitive in the wavelength range from 0.35 to 1 mum, it is being used to experiment with faint object 3D spectroscopy for a variety of objects in stellar and extragalactic astronomy. Among these experiments, we have implemented a nod-shuffle mode of operation, which is a beam switching technique to achieve a high degree of sky subtraction accuracy. We describe the technical details of the special solution found for PMAS and first results obtained in test observations of faint haloes of planetary nebulae. },

Compared to traditional long-slit observations, the large light collecting power of 2-dimensional Integral Field Units dramatically improves the prospects for performing spectroscopy on extended low surface brightness objects with high spectral resolution. This enables us to measure stellar velocity dispersions in the outer disk of normal spiral galaxies. We describe some results from a PMAS pilot study using the existing lenslet array, and provide a basic description of the new fiber IFU-module for PMAS. },

	Abstract = {From a historical point of view, it was only through the advent of the CCD as a linear, high dynamic range panoramic detector that it became possible to overcome the source confusion problem for stellar photometry, e.g., in star clusters or nearby galaxies. The ability of accurately sampling the point-spread-function (PSF) in two dimensions and to use it as a template for fitting severely overlapping stellar images is of fundamental importance for crowded-field photometry, and has thus become the foundation for the determination of accurate color-magnitude diagrams of globular clusters and the study of resolved stellar populations in nearby galaxies. Analogous to CCDs, the introduction of integral field spectrographs has opened a new avenue for crowded-field 3D spectroscopy, which benefits in the same way from PSF-fitting techniques as CCD photometry does. This paper presents first experience with sampling the PSF in 3D spectroscopy, reviews the effects of atmospheric refraction, discusses background subtraction problems, and presents several science applications as obtained from observations with the PMAS instrument at Calar Alto Observatory. },

	Abstract = {The research and development activity on image slicer systems for integral field spectroscopy has increased in recent years, allowing the simultaneous observation on the same detector matrix of two-dimensional sky maps and the spectral decomposition of light. Nowadays, image slicers lead to possible applications on future instrumentation for ground- and space-based telescopes, covering a spectral domain ranging from UV to mid-IR wavelengths. Among such projects, MUSE (Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer) is an integral field spectrograph proposed by the European Southern Observatory for its second-generation Very Large Telescope instrumentation. MUSE combines a 1<SUP>'</SUP>&#215;1<SUP>'</SUP> field of view, with a spectral resolution reaching 3000 and a spatial sampling of 0.2" provided by an adaptive optics system. MUSE operates in the visible and near-IR wavelength range (0.465-0.93 mum) and is composed of 24 identical integral field units; each one incorporates an advanced image slicer made up of a combination of mirrors and ``minilens'' arrays, a spectrograph, and a detector. This paper describes the optical design of the MUSE image slicer, which complies with top-level requirements at a reasonable cost. The optical manufacturing technique, based on an original method of assembly using molecular adhesion, is presented. Finally, we focus on the optical tests of the prototype both at a system level and at the level of individual optical elements. },

	Abstract = {Elucidating the processes that governed the assembly and evolution of galaxies over cosmic time is one of the main objectives of all of the proposed Extremely Large Telescopes (ELT). To make a leap forward in our understanding of these processes, an ELT will want to take advantage of Multi-Objects Adaptive Optics (MOAO) systems, which can substantially improve the natural seeing over a wide field of view. We have developed an end-to-end simulation to specify the science requirements of a MOAO-fed integral field spectrograph on either an 8-m or 42-m telescope. Our simulations rescale observations of local galaxies or results from numerical simulations of disc or interacting galaxies. The code is flexible in that it allows us to explore a wide range of instrumental parameters such as ensquared energy (EE), pixel size, spectral resolution, etc. For the current analysis, we limit ourselves to a local disc galaxy which exhibits simple rotation and a simulation of a merger. While the number of simulations is limited, we have attempted to generalize our results by introducing the simple concepts of `point spread function (PSF) contrast' which is the amount of light polluting adjacent spectra which we find drives the smallest EE at a given spatial scale. The choice of the spatial sampling is driven by the `scale-coupling'. By scale-coupling we mean the relationship between the integral field unit (IFU) pixel scale and the size of the features that need to be recovered by 3D spectroscopy in order to understand the nature of the galaxy and its substructure. Because the dynamical nature of galaxies is mostly reflected in their large-scale motions, a relatively coarse spatial resolution is enough to distinguish between a rotating disc and a major merger. Although we used a limited number of morphokinematic cases, our simulations suggest that, on a 42-m telescope, the choice of an IFU pixel scale of 50-75 mas seems to be sufficient. Such a coarse sampling has the benefit of lowering the exposure time to reach a specific signal-to-noise ratio as well as relaxing the performance of the MOAO system. On the other hand, recovering the full 2D kinematics of z ~ 4 galaxies requires high signal-to-noise ratio and at least an EE of 34 per cent in 150 mas (2 pixels of 75 mas). Finally, we carried out a similar study for a hypothetical galaxy/merger at z = 1.6 with a MOAO-fed spectrograph for an 8 m, and find that at least an EE of 30 per cent at 0.25 arcsec spatial sampling is required to understand the nature of discs and mergers. },

	Abstract = {I review the observational constraints on the star formation histories in the spheroids of M33 and M31, the other two spiral galaxies in the Local Group. M33 does not possess a traditional bulge; instead, it has a small nuclear region hosting stars with a wide range of ages. The star formation history of the M33 halo is poorly constrained, but composite spectra of its halo globular clusters imply a wide age spread of 5 - 7 years, while the presence of RR Lyrae stars in the halo implies at least some of the population is ancient. Although it is possible to obtain the detailed star formation history of the M33 halo via deep photometry, this has not been done to date. M31 hosts a traditional bulge that is apparently dominated by stars older than 10 Gyr. Deep photometry of the M31 halo demonstrates that it hosts both a population of ancient metal-poor stars and a significant population extending to younger ages and high metallicity, apparently due to its active merger history. },

The target clusters were chosen primarily from our previous catalogs based on multiband Hubble Space Telescope WFPC2 imaging and therefore have previous age estimates based on integrated colors. Our sample includes objects spanning the entire range of cluster ages found in M33, allowing us to study cluster kinematics as a function of age. We find that the cluster velocity dispersion with respect to the local disk motion increases dramatically with age. The young clusters have a maximum circular velocity of 87+/-11 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, similar to the previous rotation solution for H II regions in M33. When clusters are divided into age groups, the old clusters clearly have very different kinematics from the young population and from the gas disk. Monte Carlo simulations comparing synthetic disk plus halo systems with the observed velocity distribution for our old M33 clusters suggest that old clusters are likely to be composed of two distinct subpopulations, an 85%+/-5% halo component plus a 15%+/-5% disk component. This is the first evidence for distinct kinematic subpopulations among the old M33 clusters, and this galaxy appears to have a higher halo/bulge fraction of old stellar objects than found in the Galaxy. To further study the properties of halo clusters in M33, we use spectroscopic line index measurements for 17 clusters with the largest departure from disk motion, and thus the most pristine halo objects in our sample, to determine ages and approximate metal abundances. When compared with the Worthey models and with similar measurements for 12 Galactic globulars, our clusters have an age spread of ~5-7 Gyr, ~2 times as large as the spread among the Galactic sample. This small halo sample shows little evidence for a progression in metal abundance with age. There is also some support for different size (core radius) distributions when comparing ``young'' and ``old'' halo M33 clusters. We discuss these findings in the context of different galaxy formation models. },

	Abstract = {We present deep integrated-light spectroscopy of nine M33 globular clusters taken with the Hectospec instrument at the MMT Observatory. Based on our spectroscopy and previous deep color-magnitude diagrams obtained with HST WFPC2, we present evidence for the presence of a genuine intermediate-age globular cluster in M33. The analysis of Lick line indices indicates that all globular clusters are metal-poor ([Z/H]&lt;~-1.0) and that cluster M33-C38 is ~5-8 Gyr younger than the rest of the sample M33 star clusters. We find no evidence for a population of blue horizontal-branch stars in the CMD of M33-C38, which rules out the possibility of an artificially young spectroscopic age due to the presence of hot stars. We infer an initial mass of (0.8-1.2)&#215;10<SUP>5</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB> for M33-C38, which implies that intermediate-age clusters with masses similar to those of Galactic globular clusters were able to form and survive in M33, although it is not yet clear with which dynamical component of M33-thin disk, thick disk, halo-the cluster is associated.<p/>  Based on observations obtained with the Hectospec instrument at the MMT Observatory.

	Abstract = {We present the discovery of a kinematically cold stellar population along the southeastern minor axis of the Andromeda galaxy (M31) that is likely the forward continuation of M31's giant southern stream. This discovery was made during an on-going spectroscopic survey of M31 red giant branch (RGB) stars using the DEIMOS instrument on the Keck II 10 m telescope. Stellar kinematics are investigated in eight fields located 9-30 kpc from M31's center (in projection). A likelihood method based on photometric and spectroscopic diagnostics is used to isolate confirmed M31 RGB stars from foreground Milky Way dwarf stars: for the first time, this is done without using radial velocity as a selection criterion, allowing an unbiased study of M31's stellar kinematics. The radial velocity distribution of the 1013 M31 RGB stars contains two components. The broad (hot) component (sigma<SUP>sph</SUP><SUB>v</SUB>=129 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) presumably represents M31's virialized spheroid. A significant fraction (19%) of the population is in a narrow (cold) component centered near M31's systemic velocity, with a velocity dispersion that decreases with increasing radial distance, from sigma<SUP>sub</SUP><SUB>v</SUB>=55.5 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> at R<SUB>proj</SUB>=12 kpc to sigma<SUP>sub</SUP><SUB>v</SUB>=10.6 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> (9.5 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> after accounting for measurement error) at R<SUB>proj</SUB>=18 kpc. The spatial and velocity distribution of the cold component matches that of the ``Southeast shelf'' predicted by the Fardal et al. orbital model of the progenitor of M31's giant southern stream. The metallicity distribution of the cold component matches that of the giant southern stream but is about 0.2 dex more metal rich than that of the hot spheroidal component. We discuss the implications of our discovery on the interpretation of the intermediate-age spheroid population found in this region in recent ultradeep HST imaging studies. },

	Abstract = {We compare both the Milky Way and M31 galaxies to local external disk galaxies within the same mass range, using their locations in the planes drawn by V<SUB>flat</SUB> versus M<SUB>K</SUB> (the Tully-Fisher relation), j<SUB>disk</SUB> (angular momentum), and the average Fe abundance, [Fe/H], of stars in the galaxy outskirts. We find, for all relationships, that the Milky Way is systematically offset by ~1 sigma, showing a significant deficiency in stellar mass, angular momentum, disk radius, and [Fe/H] in the stars in its outskirts at a given V<SUB>flat</SUB>. On the basis of their location in the (M<SUB>K</SUB>, V<SUB>flat</SUB>, and R<SUB>d</SUB>) volume, the fraction of spirals like the Milky Way is 7%+/-1%, while M31 appears to be a ``typical'' spiral. Our galaxy appears to have escaped any significant merger over the last ~10 Gyr, which may explain why it is deficient by a factor of 2-3 in stellar mass, angular momentum, and outskirt metallicity, thus unrepresentative of the typical spiral. As with M31, most local spirals show evidence of a history shaped mainly by relatively recent merging. We conclude that the standard scenario of secular evolution driven by the accretion of gas and disk instabilities is generally unable to reproduce the properties of most (if not all) spiral galaxies. However, the so-called spiral-rebuilding scenario proposed two years ago by Hammer et al. is consistent with the properties of both distant galaxies and of their descendants, the local spirals. },

	Abstract = {We present spectroscopic observations of red giant branch (RGB) stars over a large expanse in the halo of the Andromeda spiral galaxy (M31), acquired with the DEIMOS instrument on the Keck II 10 m telescope. Using a combination of five photometric/spectroscopic diagnostics-(1) radial velocity, (2) intermediate-width DDO51 photometry, (3) Na I equivalent width (surface gravity-sensitive), (4) position in the color-magnitude diagram, and (5) comparison between photometric and spectroscopic [Fe/H] estimates-we isolate over 250 bona fide M31 bulge and halo RGB stars located in 12 fields ranging from R=12 to 165 kpc from the center of M31 (47 of these stars are halo members with R&gt;60 kpc). We derive the M31 spheroid (bulge and halo) metallicity distribution function and find it to be systematically more metal-poor with increasing radius, shifting from &lt;[Fe/H]&gt;=-0.47+/-0.03 (sigma=0.39) at R&lt;20 kpc to &lt;[Fe/H]&gt;=-0.94+/-0.06 (sigma=0.60) at R~30 kpc to &lt;[Fe/H]&gt;=-1.26+/-0.10 (sigma=0.72) at R&gt;60 kpc, assuming [alpha/Fe]=0.0. These results indicate the presence of a metal-poor RGB population at large radial distances out to at least R=160 kpc, thereby supporting our recent discovery of a stellar halo in M31 (structural component with an R<SUP>-2</SUP> power-law surface brightness profile). This component has a distinct metallicity distribution from M31's bulge. If we assume an alpha-enhancement of [alpha/Fe]=+0.3 for M31's halo, we derive &lt;[Fe/H]&gt;=-1.5+/-0.1 (sigma=0.7). Therefore, the mean metallicity and metallicity spread of this newly found remote M31 RGB population are similar to those of the Milky Way halo.<p/>  Based on observations obtained with MegaPrime/MegaCam, a joint project of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) and CEA/DAPNIA, at CFHT, which is operated by the National Research Council (NRC) of Canada, the Institut National des Science de l'Univers of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) of France, and the University of Hawaii.<p/>  Based on observations obtained with the Kitt Peak National Observatory.

	Abstract = {In this paper we derive the galaxy luminosity function from the nearby optical galaxy (NOG) sample, which is a nearly complete, magnitude-limited (B&lt;=14 mag), all-sky sample of nearby optical galaxies (~6400 galaxies with cz&lt;5500 km s^-1). For this local sample, we use galaxy distance estimates based on different peculiar velocity models. Therefore, the derivation of the luminosity function is carried out using the locations of field and grouped galaxies in real distance space. The local field galaxy luminosity function in the B system is well described by a Schechter function with a slope of alpha~-1.1, a low normalization factor (Phi^*~0.006 Mpc^-3), and a particularly bright characteristic magnitude (M^*_B~-20.6) (H_0=75 km^-1 Mpc^-1). The exact values of the Schechter parameters depend slightly on the adopted peculiar velocity field models. Peculiar motion effects are of the order of statistical errors and cause at most variations of 0.08 in alpha and 0.2 mag in M^*_B. Our M^*_B value is brighter by a few tenths of a magnitude than previous corresponding values, because using total corrected blue magnitudes better represent the galaxy light. In addition, the selection function, evaluated in terms of the luminosity function, appears to be not very sensitive to the adopted peculiar velocity field models, which, however, have a large impact on the local galaxy density on the smallest scales. The shape of the luminosity function of spiral galaxies does not differ significantly from that of E-S0 galaxies. On the other hand, the late-type spirals and irregulars have a very steeply rising luminosity function toward the faint end (alpha~-2.3 to -2.4), whereas the ellipticals appreciably decrease in number toward low luminosities. The presence of galaxy systems in the NOG sample does not significantly affect the field galaxy luminosity function, since environmental effects on the total luminosity function appear to be marginal. The luminosity function of the members of the richest galaxy systems tends to show a slightly brighter M^*_B value than the norm. In light of constraints imposed by the observed galaxy number counts, the low normalization of the luminosity function suggests that the nearby universe (cz&lt;~5000 km s^-1) examined in this paper may be underdense by a factor of ~1.5. },

	Abstract = {We present first results from a Keck DEIMOS spectroscopic survey of red giant branch (RGB) stars in M33. The radial velocity distributions of the stars in our fields are well described by three Gaussian components, corresponding to a candidate halo component with an uncorrected radial velocity dispersion of sigma~=50 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, a candidate disk component with a dispersion sigma~=16 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, and a third component offset from the disk by ~50 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, but for which the dispersion is not well constrained. By comparing our data to a model of M33 based on its H I rotation curve, we find that the stellar disk is offset in velocity by ~25 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> from the H I disk, consistent with the warping that exists between these components. The spectroscopic metallicity of the halo component is [Fe/H]~=-1.5, significantly more metal-poor than the implied metallicity of the disk population ([Fe/H]~=-0.9), which also has a broader color dispersion than the halo population. These data represent the first detections of individual stars in the halo of M33 and, despite being ~10 times less massive than M31 or the Milky Way, all three of these disk galaxies have stellar halo components with a similar metallicity. The color distribution of the third component is different from the disk and the halo but is similar to that expected for a single, coeval, stellar population, and could represent a stellar stream. More observations are required to determine the true nature of this intriguing third kinematic component in M33. },

	Abstract = {Images obtained with NIRI on the Gemini North telescope are used to investigate the photometric properties of the central regions of M31 in the 3-5 mum wavelength range. The light distribution in the central arcsecond differs from what is seen in the near-infrared in the sense that the difference in peak brightness between P1 and P2 is larger in M<SUP>'</SUP> than in K<SUP>'</SUP> no obvious signature of P3 is detected in M<SUP>'</SUP>. These results can be explained if there is a source of emission that contributes ~20% of the peak M<SUP>'</SUP> light of P1, has an effective temperature of no more than a few hundred K, and is located between P1 and P2. Based on the red K-M<SUP>'</SUP> color of this source, it is suggested that the emission originates in a circumstellar dust shell surrounding a single bright asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star. Tests of this hypothesis are described. A bright source that is ~8" from the center of the galaxy is also detected in M<SUP>'</SUP>. This object has red colors and an absolute brightness in M<SUP>'</SUP> that is similar to the most highly evolved AGB stars in the solar neighborhood; hence, it is likely to be a very evolved AGB star embedded in a circumstellar envelope. The K-band brightness of this star is close to the peak expected for AGB evolution, and an age of only a few hundred million years is estimated, which is comparable to that of the P3 star cluster. Finally, using high angular resolution near-infrared adaptive optics images as a guide, a sample of unblended AGB stars outside of the central few arcseconds is defined in L<SUP>'</SUP>. The (L<SUP>'</SUP>, K-L<SUP>'</SUP>) color-magnitude diagram of these sources shows a dominant AGB population with a peak L<SUP>'</SUP> brightness and a range of K-L<SUP>'</SUP> colors that are similar to those of the most luminous M giants in the Galactic bulge.<p/>  Based on observations obtained at the Gemini Observatory, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under a cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation (NSF) on behalf of the Gemini partnership: the NSF (United States), the Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council (United Kingdom), the National Research Council of Canada (Canada), CONICYT (Chile), the Australian Research Council (Australia), CNPq (Brazil), and CONICET (Argentina). },

	Abstract = {The halo of M31 shows a wealth of substructures, some of which are consistent with assembly from satellite accretion. Here we report on kinematic and abundance results from Keck DEIMOS spectroscopy in the near-infrared calcium triplet region of over 3500 red giant star candidates along the minor axis and in off-axis spheroid fields of M31. These data reach out to large radial distances of about 160 kpc. The derived radial velocity distributions show an indication of a kinematically cold substructure around ~17 kpc, which has been reported before. We devise a new and improved method to measure spectroscopic metallicities from the calcium triplet in low signal-to-noise ratio spectra using a weighted co-addition of the individual lines. The resulting distribution (accurate to ~0.3 dex down to signal-to-noise ratios of 5) leads us to note an even stronger gradient in the abundance distribution along M31's minor axis and in particular toward the outer halo fields than previously detected. The mean metallicity in the outer fields reaches below -2 dex, with individual values as low as &lt;~-2.6 dex. This is the first time such a metal-poor halo has been detected in M31. In the fields toward the inner spheroid, we find a sharp decline of ~0.5 dex in metallicity in a region at ~20 kpc, which roughly coincides with the edge of an extended disk, previously detected from star count maps. A large fraction of red giants that we detect in the most distant fields are likely members of M33's overlapping halo. A comparison of our velocities with those predicted by new N-body simulations argues that the event responsible for the Giant Stream is most likely not responsible for the full population of the inner halo. We show further that the abundance distribution of the Stream is different from that of the inner halo, from which it becomes evident, in turn, that the merger event that formed the Stream and the outer halo cannot have contributed any significant material to the inner spheroid. All these severe structure changes in the halo suggest a high degree of infall and stochastic abundance accretion governing the buildup of M31's inner and outer halo.<p/>  Some of the data presented herein were obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

	Abstract = {We present the first results from our survey of stellar substructure in the outskirts of M31 using the Advanced Camera for Surveys on board the Hubble Space Telescope. We discuss the stellar populations associated with five prominent stellar overdensities discovered during the course of our panoramic ground-based imaging survey with the Isaac Newton Telescope Wide-Field Camera; a sixth pointing targets a region of ``clean'' halo. The color-magnitude diagrams, which contain between ~10,000 and 90,000 stars and reach 4 mag below the horizontal branch, reveal clear variations in morphology between most fields, indicating that the age and/or metallicity mix of stars is not constant at large radius. This directly confirms the existence of large-scale population inhomogeneities within the halo of M31 and lends further support to the notion that M31 has formed, at least in part, through satellite accretions. We find a striking similarity between the populations of the giant stellar stream and those of another overdensity, the NE shelf, which lies northeast of the galaxy center. If these overdensities are associated with the same population, then the difference in their red clump magnitudes implies that the NE shelf lies in front of the stream by several tens of kiloparsecs, in good agreement with recent orbit calculations for the stream progenitor.<p/>  Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.

@article{Brown:2006a,
	Abstract = {Using HST ACS, we have obtained deep optical images reaching stars well below the oldest main-sequence turnoff in the spheroid, tidal stream, and outer disk of Andromeda. We have reconstructed the star formation history in these fields by comparing their color-magnitude diagrams to a grid of isochrones calibrated to Galactic globular clusters observed in the same bands. Each field exhibits an extended star formation history, with many stars younger than 10 Gyr but few younger than 4 Gyr. Considered together, the star counts, kinematics, and population characteristics of the spheroid argue against some explanations for its intermediate-age, metal-rich population, such as a significant contribution from stars residing in the disk or a chance intersection with the stream's orbit. Instead, it is likely that this population is intrinsic to the inner spheroid, whose highly disturbed structure is clearly distinct from the pressure-supported metal-poor halo that dominates farther from the galaxy's center. The stream and spheroid populations are similar, but not identical, with the stream's mean age being ~1 Gyr younger; this similarity suggests that the inner spheroid is largely polluted by material stripped from either the stream's progenitor or similar objects. The disk population is considerably younger and more metal-rich than the stream and spheroid populations, but not as young as the thin-disk population of the solar neighborhood; instead, the outer disk of Andromeda is dominated by stars of age 4-8 Gyr, resembling the Milky Way's thick disk. The disk data are inconsistent with a population dominated by ages older than 10 Gyr and in fact do not require any stars older than 10 Gyr.<p/>  Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by AURA, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.

	Abstract = {Hubble Space Telescope imaging of 11 fields in M31 were reduced to color-magnitude diagrams. The fields were chosen to sample all galactocentric radii to 50 kpc (~9 disk scale lengths, or &gt;99.9% of the total light enclosed). The colors of the red giants at each pointing map to an abundance distribution with errors of order 0.1 dex in [M/H]. The abundance distributions are all about the same width but show a mild gradient that flattens outside ~20 kpc. These distributions were weighted and summed with the aid of a new surface brightness profile fit to obtain an abundance distribution representative of the entirety of M31. Since we expect M31 to have retained most of its congenital gas and subsequently accreted material, and since the present-day gas mass fraction is around 2%, it must be a system near chemical maturity. This ``observed closed box'' is found to suffer from a lack of metal-poor stars and metal-rich stars relative to the simplest closed-box model in the same way as the solar neighborhood. Models modified to include inhomogeneous chemical enrichment, variable yield, or infall all fit to within the uncertainties. As noted elsewhere, stars in the outer regions of M31 are a factor of 10 more metal-rich than the Milky Way halo, 10 times more metal-rich than the dwarf spheroidals cospatial with it, and more metal-rich than most of the globular clusters at the same galactocentric radius. Difficulties of interpretation are greatly eased if we posit that the M31 disk dominates over the halo at all radii out to 50 kpc. In fact, scaling from current density models of the Milky Way, one should not expect to see halo stars dominating over disk stars until beyond our 50 kpc limit. A corollary conclusion is that most published studies of the M31 ``halo'' are actually studies of its disk. },

	Abstract = {We analyze warps in the nearby edge-on spiral galaxies observed in the {\em Spitzer/IRAC} 4.5 micron band. In our sample of 24 galaxies we find evidence of warp in 14 galaxies. We estimate the observed onset radii for the warps in a subsample of 10 galaxies. The dark matter distribution in each of these galaxies are calculated using the mass distribution derived from the observed light distribution and the observed rotation curves. The theoretical predictions of the onset radii for the warps are then derived by applying a self-consistent linear response theory to the obtained mass models for 6 galaxies with rotation curves in the literature. By comparing the observed onset radii to the theoretical ones, we find that discs with constant thickness can not explain the observations; moderately flaring discs are needed. The required flaring is consistent with the observations. Our analysis shows that the onset of warp is not symmetric in our sample of galaxies. We define a new quantity called the onset-asymmetry index and study its dependence on galaxy properties. The onset asymmetries in warps tend to be larger in galaxies with smaller disc scale lengths. We also define and quantify the global asymmetry in the stellar light distribution, that we call the edge-on asymmetry in edge-on galaxies. It is shown that in most cases the onset asymmetry in warp is actually anti-correlated with the measured edge-on asymmetry in our sample of edge-on galaxies and this could plausibly indicate that the surrounding dark matter distribution is asymmetric. },

	Abstract = {We present the results of a kinematic study of planetary nebulae in the extreme outskirts of two spiral galaxies, M83 (NGC 5236) and M94 (NGC 4736). We find that in the inner regions of the galaxies, the vertical velocity dispersion (sigma<SUB> z </SUB>) falls off exponentially with the light, as expected for a constant mass-to-light ratio, constant thickness disk. However, starting at four optical scale lengths, sigma<SUB> z </SUB> asymptotes out at roughly 20 km s<SUP>--1</SUP>. Our analysis finds evidence for significant flaring in the outer regions as well, especially in M94. These observations are in excellent agreement with predictions derived from models of disk heating by halo substructure, and demonstrate how kinematic surveys in the outer disks of spirals can be used to test hierarchical models of galaxy formation. },

	Abstract = {We examine the proposal that the HI "high-velocity" clouds (HVCs) surrounding the Milky Way and other disc galaxies form by condensation of the hot galactic corona via thermal instability. We find that very special conditions are required for this mechanism to work: the corona must have an almost perfectly flat entropy profile. In all other cases the growth of thermal perturbations is suppressed by a combination of buoyancy and thermal conduction. Even if the entropy profile were nearly flat, cold clouds with sizes smaller than 10 kpc could form in the corona of the Milky Way only at radii larger than 100 kpc, in contradiction with the determined distances of the largest HVC complexes. Clouds with sizes of a few kpc can form in the inner halo only in low-mass systems. We conclude that thermal instability is not a viable mechanism for formation of cold clouds around disc galaxies. },

MIPS 24 mum photometry can yield SFRs accurately from this luminosity upward: SFR(M <SUB>sun</SUB> yr<SUP>--1</SUP>) = 7.8 &#215; 10<SUP>--10</SUP> L(24 mum, L <SUB>sun</SUB>) from L(TIR) = 5&#215; 10<SUP>9</SUP> L <SUB>sun</SUB> to 10<SUP>11</SUP> L <SUB>sun</SUB> and SFR = 7.8 &#215; 10<SUP>--10</SUP> L(24 mum, L <SUB>sun</SUB>)(7.76 &#215; 10<SUP>--11</SUP> L(24))<SUP>0.048</SUP> for higher L(TIR).

For L(TIR) &gt;= 10<SUP>11</SUP> L <SUB>sun</SUB>, we find that the SFR of infrared galaxies is significantly underestimated using extinction-corrected Paalpha (and presumably using any other optical or near-infrared recombination lines). As a part of this work, we constructed spectral energy distribution templates for eleven luminous and ultraluminous purely star forming infrared galaxies and over the spectral range 0.4 mum to 30 cm. We use these templates and the SINGS data to construct average templates from 5 mum to 30 cm for infrared galaxies with L(TIR) = 5&#215; 10<SUP>9</SUP> to 10<SUP>13</SUP> L <SUB>sun</SUB>. All of these templates are made available online. },

	Abstract = {New images of M31 at 24, 70, and 160 mum taken with the Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer (MIPS) reveal the morphology of the dust in this galaxy. This morphology is well represented by a composite of two logarithmic spiral arms and a circular ring (radius ~10 kpc) of star formation offset from the nucleus. The two spiral arms appear to start at the ends of a bar in the nuclear region and extend beyond the star-forming ring. As has been found in previous work, the spiral arms are not continuous, but composed of spiral segments. The star-forming ring is very circular except for a region near M32 where it splits. The lack of well-defined spiral arms and the prominence of the nearly circular ring suggest that M31 has been distorted by interactions with its satellite galaxies. Using new dynamical simulations of M31 interacting with M32 and NGC 205, we find that, qualitatively, such interactions can produce an offset, split ring like that seen in the MIPS images. },

	Abstract = {Carbon stars are known to exhibit systematically redder near-infrared colours with respect to M-type stars. In the near-infrared colour-magnitude diagrams provided by the 2MASS and DENIS surveys, the LMC C-type stars draw a striking ``red tail'', well separated from the sequences of O-rich giants. So far, this conspicuous feature has been absent from any set of available isochrones, even the few existing ones that include the TP-AGB evolution of low- and intermediate-mass stars. To investigate such issue we simulate the complete 2MASS K<SUB>s</SUB> vs. (J-K<SUB>s</SUB>) data towards the LMC by means of a population synthesis approach, that relies on extended libraries of published stellar evolutionary tracks, including the TP-AGB phase. The simulations provide quite a detailed description of the several vertical ``fingers'' and inclined sequences seen in 2MASS data, due to both galactic foreground and LMC O-rich stars. Instead, as mentioned, the red tail of C-stars sets a major difficulty: we find that TP-AGB models with solar-scaled molecular opacities, the usual assumption of existing AGB calculations, do not succeed in reproducing this feature. Our tests indicate that the main reason for this failure should not be ascribed to empirical T<SUB>eff</SUB>-(J-K) transformations for C-type stars. Instead, the discrepancy is simply removed by adopting new evolutionary models that account for the changes in molecular opacities as AGB stars get enriched in carbon via the third dredge-up (Marigo \cite{Marigo02}). In fact, simulations that adopt these models are able to reproduce, for the first time, the red tail of C-stars in near-infrared CMDs. Finally, we point out that these simulations also provide useful indications about the efficiency of the third dredge-up process, and the pulsation modes of long-period variables. },

	Abstract = {We obtained long-slit spectra of high signal-to-noise ratio of the galaxy M32 with the GMOS spectrograph at the GEMINI North telescope. We analysed the integrated spectra by means of full spectral fitting in order to extract the mixture of stellar populations that best represents its composite nature. Three different galactic radii were analysed, from the nuclear region out to 2 arcmin from the centre. This allows us to compare, for the first time, the results of integrated light spectroscopy with those of resolved colour-magnitude diagrams from the literature. As our main result, we propose that an ancient and an intermediate-age population coexist in M32, and that the balance between these two populations change between the nucleus and outside 1 effective radius in the sense that the contribution from the intermediate population is larger at the nuclear region. We retrieve a smaller signal of a young population at all radii whose origin is unclear and may be a contamination from horizontal-branch stars, such as the ones identified by Brown et al. in the nuclear region. We compare our metallicity distribution function for a region 1 to 2 arcmin from the centre to the one obtained with photometric data by Grillmair et al. Both distributions are broad, but our spectroscopically derived distribution has a significant component with $[Z/Z_{\sun}] \leq -1$, which is not found by Grillmair et al. },

	Abstract = {The dwarf satellite galaxies in the Local Group are generally considered to be hosted in dark matter subhalos that survived the disruptive processes during infall onto their host halos. It has recently been argued that if the majority of satellites entered the Milky Way halo in a group rather than individually, this could explain the spatial and dynamical peculiarities of its satellite distribution. Such groups were identified as dwarf galaxy associations that are found in the nearby Universe. In this paper we address the question whether galaxies in such associations can be the progenitors of the Milky Way satellite galaxies. We find that the dwarf associations are much more extended than would be required to explain the disk-like distribution of the Milky Way and Andromeda satellite galaxies. We further identify a possible minor filamentary structure, perpendicular to the supergalactic plane, in which the dwarf associations are located, that might be related to the direction of infall of a progenitor galaxy of the Milky Way satellites, if they are of tidal origin. },

@article{Williams:2009,
	Abstract = {We present resolved stellar photometry of 4 fields along the major axis of the M33 disk from images taken with the Advanced Camera for Surveys aboard the Hubble Space Telescope. The photometry provides a detailed census of the red clump in all fields and reaches the ancient main sequence in the outermost field. Through detailed modeling of the color-magnitude diagrams, we find that the percentage of the stellar mass formed prior to z=1 changes from 71 +/- 9% in the innermost field to 16 +/- 6% in the outermost field. The disk shows a clear trend of increasing scale-length with time, evolving from 1.0 +/- 0.1 kpc 10 Gyr ago to 1.8 +/- 0.1 kpc at times more recent than 5 Gyr ago, in agreement with analytical predictions for disk growth. Beyond the disk truncation radius, however, the stellar density profile steepens with time and the age gradient reverses, in agreement with recent simulations. The late and slow growth of the stellar disk may be due in part to the low mass of M33. },

	Abstract = {Our multi-epoch survey of ~20 sq. deg. of the Canis Major overdensity has detected only 10 RR Lyrae stars (RRLS). We show that this number is consistent with the number expected from the Galactic halo and thick disk populations alone, leaving no excess that can be attributed to the dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxy that some authors have proposed as the origin of the CMa overdensity. If this galaxy resembles the dSph satellites of the Milky Way and of M31 and has the putative Mv~-14.5, our survey should have detected several tens of RRLS. Even if Mv&lt;-12, the expected excess is &gt;10, which is not observed. Either the old stellar population of this galaxy has unique properties or, as others have argued before, the CMa overdensity is produced by the thin and thick disk and spiral arm populations of the Milky Way and not by a collision with a dSph satellite galaxy. },

	Abstract = {We announce the discovery of a new Milky Way satellite Segue 2 found in the data of the Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration (SEGUE). We followed this up with deeper imaging and spectroscopy on the Multiple Mirror Telescope. From this, we derive a luminosity of M_v = -2.5, a half-light radius of 34 pc and a systemic velocity of -40$ km/s. Our MMT data also provides evidence for a stream around Segue 2 at a similar heliocentric velocity, and the SEGUE data show that it is also present in neighboring fields. We resolve the velocity dispersion of Segue 2 as 3.4 km/s and the possible stream as about 7 km/s. This object shows points of comparison with other recent discoveries, Segue 1, Boo II and Coma. We speculate that all four objects may be representatives of a population of satellites of satellites -- survivors of accretion events that destroyed their larger but less dense parents. They are likely to have formed at redshifts z &gt; 10 and are good candidates for fossils of the reionization epoch. },

We perform comparisons between these new models, and our reference alpha-enhanced calculations, and discuss briefly implications for CMDs showing multiple main sequence or subgiant branches. A brief qualitative discussion of the effect of CN abundances on color-T_{eff} transformations is also presented, highlighting the need to determine theoretical color transformations for the appropriate metal mixture, if one wants to interpret observations in the Stroemgren system, or broadband filters blueward of the Johnson V-band. },

	Abstract = {We present a Bayesian sampling algorithm called adaptive importance sampling or Population Monte Carlo (PMC), whose computational workload is easily parallelizable and thus has the potential to considerably reduce the wall-clock time required for sampling, along with providing other benefits. To assess the performance of the approach for cosmological problems, we use simulated and actual data consisting of CMB anisotropies, supernovae of type Ia, and weak cosmological lensing, and provide a comparison of results to those obtained using state-of-the-art Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). For both types of data sets, we find comparable parameter estimates for PMC and MCMC, with the advantage of a significantly lower computational time for PMC. In the case of WMAP5 data, for example, the wall-clock time reduces from several days for MCMC to a few hours using PMC on a cluster of processors. Other benefits of the PMC approach, along with potential difficulties in using the approach, are analysed and discussed. },

	Abstract = {We present the first large-scale mosaic performed with the Submillimeter Array (SMA) in the Galactic center. We have produced a 25-pointing mosaic, covering a ~2' x 2' area around Sgr A*. We have detected emission from two high-density molecular tracers, HCN(4-3) and CS(7-6), the latter never before reported in this region. The data have an angular resolution of 4.6" x 3.1", and the spectral window coverage is from -180 km/s to 1490 km/s for HCN(4-3) and from -1605 km/s to 129 km/s for CS(7-6). Both molecular tracers present a very clumpy distribution along the circumnuclear disk (CND), and are detected with a high signal-to-noise ratio in the southern part of the CND, while they are weaker towards the northern part. Assuming that the clumps are as close to the Galactic center as their projected distances, they are still dense enough to be gravitationally stable against the tidal shear produced by the supermassive black hole. Therefore, the CND is a non-transient structure. This geometrical distribution of both tracers suggests that the southern part of the CND is denser than the northern part. Also, by comparing the HCN(4-3) results with HCN(1-0) results we can see that the northern and the southern parts of the CND have different excitation levels, with the southern part warmer than the northern. Finally, we compare our results with those obtained with the detection of NH3, which traces the warmer and less dense material detected in the inner cavity of the CND. We suggest that we are detecting the origin point where a portion of the CND becomes destabilized and approaches the dynamical center of the Milky Way, possibly being impacted by the southern streamer and heated on its way inwards. },

	Abstract = {We present spectroscopic observations from the {\it Spitzer Space Telescope} of six carbon-rich AGB stars in the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy (Sgr dSph) and two foreground Galactic carbon stars. The band strengths of the observed C$_2$H$_2$ and SiC features are very similar to those observed in Galactic AGB stars. The metallicities are estimated from an empirical relation between the acetylene optical depth and the strength of the SiC feature. The metallicities are higher than those of the LMC, and close to Galactic values. While the high metallicity could imply an age of around 1 Gyr, for the dusty AGB stars, the pulsation periods suggest ages in excess of 2 or 3 Gyr. We fit the spectra of the observed stars using the DUSTY radiative transfer model and determine their dust mass-loss rates to be in the range 1.0--3.3$\times 10^{-8} $M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$. The two Galactic foreground carbon-rich AGB stars are located at the far side of the solar circle, beyond the Galactic Centre. One of these two stars show the strongest SiC feature in our present Local Group sample. },

	Abstract = {Young Massive Clusters (YMCs) represent ideal testbeds in which to study massive stellar evolution as they contain large, coeval, chemically homogeneous, samples of massive stars. By studying YMCs with a range of ages (and hence turn-off masses), we can investigate the post main-sequence evolution of massive stars as a function of initial mass. Recent discoveries of YMCs over a range of ages within our own Galaxy - where we can successfully resolve individual stars - offers the unprecedented opportunity to test our ideas of massive stellar evolution. Here, I review some of the recent works in this field, and describe how we can use YMCs to investigate several topics, including (a) the evolutionary state of H-rich Wolf-Rayet stars; (b) the influence of binarity on stellar evolution in dense clusters; and (c) Red Supergiants and the post-supernova remnants they leave behind. },

	Abstract = {Broadband and narrowband images covering the 1-4 mum wavelength interval are used to investigate the properties of the brightest asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars in the Local Group galaxy M32. Data obtained with the NIRI imager on the Gemini North telescope indicate that the brightest AGB stars near the center of M32 have peak M<SUB>L<SUP>'</SUP></SUB> brightnesses and K-L<SUP>'</SUP> colors that are similar to those of luminous AGB stars in the Galactic disk. Data obtained with the CFHTIR imager on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope indicate that the density of bright AGB stars per unit visible and near-infrared surface brightness is constant out to projected major-axis distances of 1 kpc, suggesting that the AGB stars and their progenitors are smoothly mixed throughout the main body of the galaxy. In addition, the J-K color distribution of bright AGB stars throughout much of the galaxy is consistent with that of a single population of AGB stars, the majority of which are long-period variables that have a common metallicity and age. Thus, these data do not support spectroscopic studies that find an age gradient in M32. The AGB contributes 70%<SUP>+30%</SUP><SUB>-20%</SUB> of the integrated light in the region surveyed. This is consistent with previous estimates made from the integrated near-infrared spectrum and is suggestive of an age of ~2 Gyr. The stellar content of M32 is compared with that of the M31 bulge at a projected minor-axis distance of 1.4 kpc. While the peak K-band brightnesses of AGB stars in the two systems agree to within a few tenths of a magnitude, M32 contains more bright AGB stars per unit integrated brightness than the outer bulge of M31. This suggests a difference in mean age, and it is concluded that the star-forming histories of M32 and the bulge of M31 have differed over a significant fraction of their lifetimes, which is consistent with spectroscopic studies of these systems. The well-mixed AGB content of M32 is consistent with the galaxy having been tidally stirred, presumably by interactions with M31.<p/>  Based on observations obtained at the Gemini Observatory, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under a cooperative agreement with the NSF on behalf of the Gemini partnership: the National Science Foundation (United States), the Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council (United Kingdom), the National Research Council of Canada (Canada), CONICYT (Chile), the Australian Research Council (Australia), CNPq (Brazil), and CONICET (Argentina).<p/>  This publication makes use of data products from the Two Micron All Sky Survey, which is a joint project of the University of Massachusetts and the Infrared Processing and Analysis Center, California Institute of Technology, funded by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the National Science Foundation. },

	Abstract = {We present observations at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, 8, 24, 70, and 160 mum of NGC 205, the dwarf elliptical companion of M31, obtained with the Spitzer Space Telescope. The point-source-subtracted images at 8 and 24 mum display a complex and fragmented infrared emission coming from both very small dust particles and larger grains. The extended dust emission is spatially concentrated in three main emission regions, seen at all wavelengths from 8 to 160 mum. These regions lie approximately along NGC 205's semimajor axis and range from ~100 to 300 pc in size. On the basis of our mid-/far-infrared flux density measurements alone, we derive a total dust mass estimate on the order of 3.2&#215;10<SUP>4</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB>, mainly at a temperature of ~20 K. The gas mass associated with this component matches the predicted mass returned by the dying stars from the last burst of star formation in NGC 205 (~0.5 Gyr ago). Analysis of the Spitzer data combined with previous 1.1 mm observations over a small central or ``Core'' region (18" diameter) suggests the presence of very cold (T~12 K) dust and a dust mass about 16 times higher than is estimated from the Spitzer measurements alone. Assuming a gas-to-dust mass ratio of 100, these two data sets, i.e., with and without the millimeter observations, suggest a total gas mass in the range from 3.2&#215;10<SUP>6</SUP> to 5&#215;10<SUP>7</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB>. },

	Abstract = {Using test particle simulations we examine the structure of the outer Galactic disk as it is perturbed by a low mass satellite in a tight eccentric orbit about the Galaxy. A low mass satellite of mass a few times 10^9 Msol can heat the outer Galactic disk, excite spiral structure and a warp and induce streams in the velocity distribution. We examine particle eccentricity versus the change in mean radius between initial and current orbits. Correlations between these quantities are reduced after a few satellite pericenter passages. Stars born in the outer galaxy can be moved in radius from their birth positions and be placed in low eccentricity orbits inside their birth radii. We propose that mergers and perturbations from satellite galaxies and subhalos can induce radial mixing in the stellar metallicity distribution. },

	Abstract = {We report on the detection of four new stellar debris streams and a new dwarf galaxy candidate in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Three of the streams, ranging between 3 and 15 kpc in distance and spanning between 37&deg; and 84&deg; on the sky, are very narrow and are most probably tidal streams originating in extant or disrupted globular clusters. The fourth stream is much broader, roughly 45 kpc distant, at least 53&deg; in length, and is most likely the tidal debris from a dwarf galaxy. As each of the streams spans multiple constellations, we extend tradition and designate them the Acheron, Cocytos, Lethe, and Styx streams. At the same distance and apparently embedded in the Styx stream is a ~1 kpc wide concentration of stars with an apparently similar color-magnitude distribution, which we designate Bootes III. Given its very low surface density, its location within the stream, and its apparently disturbed morphology, we argue that Bootes III may be the progenitor of Styx and in possibly the final throes of tidal dissolution. While the current data do not permit strong constraints, preliminary orbit estimates for the streams do not point to any likely progenitors among the known globular clusters and dwarf galaxies. },

	Abstract = {The tidal tails of the globular cluster Palomar 5 are analyzed over a 41 deg<SUP>2</SUP> area of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey photometric catalogs. The matched filter algorithm provides the maximum possible signal-to-noise detection of the cluster stars over the measured background, and the expected and actual effectiveness of the technique in the context of this data set is discussed. The stellar background is examined in some detail for systematic variation as a function of Galactic position in order to assess its effect on the detection efficiency. Of the total number of Pal 5 stars detected, 45% are out in the tails. The tails are found as the only additional 3 sigma overdensity of cluster stars over the entire 41 deg<SUP>2</SUP> area studied. The annular-averaged density of stars along the tails is fitted to a power law in radius with best-fit index -1.58+/-0.07, significantly steeper than that predicted from a constant orbit-averaged mass-loss rate. },

@article{Kepley:2007,
	Abstract = {We have assembled a sample of halo stars in the solar neighborhood to look for halo substructure in velocity and angular momentum space. Our sample (231 stars) includes red giants, RR Lyrae variable stars, and red horizontal branch stars within 2.5 kpc of the Sun with [Fe/H] less than -1.0. It was chosen to include stars with accurate distances, space velocities, and metallicities, as well as well-quantified errors. With our data set, we confirm the existence of the streams found by Helmi and coworkers, which we refer to as the H99 streams. These streams have a double-peaked velocity distribution in the z-direction (out of the Galactic plane). We use the results of modeling of the H99 streams by Helmi and collaborators to test how one might use v<SUB>z</SUB> velocity information and radial velocity information to detect kinematic substructure in the halo. We find that detecting the H99 streams with radial velocities alone would require a large sample (e.g., approximately 150 stars within 2 kpc of the Sun and within 20&deg; of the Galactic poles). In addition, we use the velocity distribution of the H99 streams to estimate their age. From our model of the progenitor of the H99 streams, we determine that it was accreted between 6 and 9 Gyr ago. The H99 streams have [alpha/Fe] abundances similar to other halo stars in the solar neighborhood, suggesting that the gas that formed these stars were enriched mostly by Type II supernovae. We have also discovered in angular momentum space two other possible substructures, which we refer to as the retrograde and prograde outliers. The retrograde outliers are likely to be halo substructure, but the prograde outliers are most likely part of the smooth halo. The retrograde outliers have significant structure in the v<SUB>phi</SUB> direction and show a range of [alpha/Fe], with two having low [alpha/Fe] for their [Fe/H]. The fraction of substructure stars in our sample is between 5% and 7%. The methods presented in this paper can be used to exploit the kinematic information present in future large databases like RAVE, SDSS-II/SEGUE, and Gaia. },

@article{McDonald:2009,
	Abstract = {We present bulge and disc (B/D) decompositions of existing K' surface brightness profiles for 65 Ursa Major (UMa) cluster spiral galaxies. This improves upon the disc-only fits of Tully et al. The 1996 disc fits were used by Tully &#38; Verheijen for their discovery of the bimodality of structural parameters in the UMa cluster galaxies. It is shown that our new one-dimensional B/D decompositions yield disc structural parameters that differ only slightly from the basic fits of Tully et al. and evidence for structural bimodality of UMa galaxies is maintained. Our B/D software for the decomposition of one-dimensional surface brightness profiles of galaxies uses a non-linear minimization scheme to recover the best-fitting S&#233;rsic bulge and the exponential disc while accounting for the possible presence of a compact nucleus and spiral arms and for the effects of seeing and disc truncations. In agreement with Tully &#38; Verheijen, we find that the distribution of near-infrared disc central surface brightnesses is bimodal with an F-test confidence of 80 per cent. There is also strong evidence for a local minimum in the luminosity function at . A connection between the brightness bimodality and a dynamical bimodality, based on new HI linewidths, is identified. The B/D parameters are presented in Table 1. },

It populates the available stellar isochrones with stars according to the initial mass function and distributes stars randomly following the analytical surface number density profile. The tool is aimed at simulating realistic images of extragalactic star clusters and can be used to: (i) optimize object detection algorithms, (ii) perform artificial cluster tests for the analysis of star cluster surveys, and (iii) assess the stochastic effects introduced into photometric and structural parameters of clusters due to random distribution of luminous stars and non-uniform interstellar extinction. By applying SimClust, we have demonstrated a significant influence of stochastic effects on the determined photometric and structural parameters of low-mass star clusters in the M31 galaxy disk.

	Abstract = {We present Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) far-UV (FUV) and near-UV (NUV) mosaic observations covering the entirety of M31 and M33. For both targets, we measure the decline of surface brightness (in FUV and NUV) and changes in FUV-NUV color as a function of galactocentric radius. These UV radial profiles are compared to the distribution of ionized gas traced by Halpha emission. We find that the extent of the UV emission, in both targets, is greater than the extent of the observed H II regions and diffuse ionized gas. We determine the ultraviolet diffuse fraction in M33 using our FUV observations and compare it to the Halpha diffuse fraction obtained from wide-field narrowband imaging. The FUV diffuse fraction appears to be remarkably constant near 0.65 over a large range in galactocentric radius, with departures to higher values in circumnuclear regions and, most notably, at the limit of the Halpha disk. We suggest that the increase in the FUV diffuse fraction at large galactocentric radii could indicate that a substantial portion of the diffuse emission beyond this point is not generated in situ but rather scattered from dust, after originating in the vicinity of the disk's outermost H II regions. The radial variation of the Halpha diffuse fraction was also measured. We found the Halpha diffuse fraction generally near 0.4 but rising toward the galaxy center, up to 0.6. We made no attempt to correct our diffuse fraction measurements for position-dependent extinction, so the quoted values are best interpreted as upper limits given the plausibly higher extinction for stellar clusters relative to their surroundings. },

@article{Richardson:2009,
	Abstract = {We present a high precision photometric view of the stellar populations in the outer halo of M31, using data taken with the Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys (HST/ACS). We analyse the field populations adjacent to 11 luminous globular clusters which sample the galactocentric radial range 18 &lt; R &lt; 100 kpc and reach a photometric depth of ~2.5 magnitudes below the horizontal branch (m_F814W ~27 mag). The colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) are well populated out to ~60 kpc and exhibit relatively metal-rich red giant branches, with the densest fields also showing evidence for prominent red clumps. We use the Dartmouth isochrones to construct metallicity distribution functions (MDFs) which confirm the presence of dominant populations with &lt;[Fe/H]&gt; = -0.6 to -1.0 dex and considerable metallicity dispersions of 0.2 to 0.3 dex (assuming a 10 Gyr population and scaled-Solar abundances). The average metallicity over the range 30 - 60 kpc is [Fe/H] = -0.8 +/- 0.14 dex, with no evidence for a significant radial gradient. Metal-poor stars ([Fe/H] &lt;= -1.3) typically account for &lt; 10-20 % of the population in each field, irrespective of radius. Assuming our fields are unbiased probes of the dominant stellar populations in these parts, we find that the M31 outer halo remains considerably more metal-rich than that of the Milky Way out to at least 60 kpc. },

	Abstract = {Aims.We present a 900 s, wide-field U image of the inner region of the Andromeda galaxy obtained during the commissioning of the blue channel of the Large Binocular Camera mounted on the prime focus of the Large Binocular Telescope.  Methods: Relative photometry and absolute astrometry of individual sources in the image was obtained along with morphological parameters aimed at discriminating between stars and extended sources, e.g. globular clusters.   Results: The image unveils the near-ultraviolet view of the inner ring of star formation recently discovered in the infrared by the Spitzer Space Telescope and shows in great detail the fine structure of the dust lanes associated with the galaxy inner spiral arms. The capabilities of the blue channel of the Large Binocular Camera at the Large Binocular Telescope (LBC-Blue) are probed by direct comparison with ultraviolet GALEX observations of the same region in M 31. We discovered 6 new candidate stellar clusters in this high-background region of M 31. We also recovered 62 bona-fide globulars and 62 previously known candidates from the Revised Bologna Catalogue of the M 31 globular clusters, and firmly established the extended nature of 19 of them. },

	Abstract = {We present spectroscopic observations of the And XII dwarf spheroidal galaxy using DEIMOS/Keck II, showing it to be moving rapidly through the Local Group (-556 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> heliocentric velocity, -281 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> relative to Andromeda), falling into the Local Group from ~115 kpc beyond Andromeda's nucleus. And XII therefore represents a dwarf galaxy plausibly falling into the Local Group for the first time and never having experienced a dense galactic environment. From Green Bank Telescope observations, a limit on the H I gas mass of &lt;3&#215;10<SUP>3</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB> suggests that And XII's gas could have been removed prior to experiencing the tides of the Local Group galaxies. Orbit models suggest that the dwarf is close to the escape velocity of M31 for published mass models. And XII is our best direct evidence for the late infall of satellite galaxies, a prediction of cosmological simulations. },

This review describes the main features of the sky and velocity distributions, as well as the available information on cloud properties, small-scale structure, velocity structure, and observations other than in 21-cm emission. We show that HVCs contain heavy elements and that the more prominent ones are more than 2 kpc from the Galactic plane. We evaluate the hypotheses proposed for their origin and reject those that account for only one or a few HVCs. At least three different hypotheses are needed: one for the Magellanic Stream and possibly related clouds, one for the Outer Arm Extension, and one (or more) for the other HVCs. We discuss the evidence for the accretion and the fountain model but cannot rule out either one. },

	Abstract = {Using the 100-m radio telescope at Effelsberg, we mapped a large area around the Andromeda Galaxy in the 21cm line emission of neutral hydrogen to search for high-velocity clouds (HVCs) out to large projected distances in excess of 100kpc. Our 3sigma HI mass sensitivity for the warm neutral medium is 8 &#215; 10<SUP>4</SUP>M<SUB>solar</SUB>. We can confirm the existence of a population of HVCs near M31 with typical HI masses of a few times 10<SUP>5</SUP>M<SUB>solar</SUB>. However, we did not detect any HVCs beyond a projected distance of about 50kpc from M31, suggesting that HVCs are generally found in proximity of large spiral galaxies at typical distances of a few 10kpc.<p/>  Comparison with cold dark matter (CDM)-based models and simulations suggests that only a few of the detected HVCs could be associated with primordial dark matter satellites, whereas others are most likely the result of tidal stripping. The lack of clouds beyond a projected distance of 50kpc from M31 is also in conflict with the predictions of recent CDM structure formation simulations. A possible solution to this problem could be ionization of the HVCs as a result of decreasing pressure of the ambient coronal gas at larger distances from M31. A consequence of this scenario would be the presence of hundreds of mainly ionized or pure dark matter satellites around large spiral galaxies like the Milky Way and M31. },

	Abstract = {Great strides have been made in the last two decades in determining how galaxies evolve from their initial dark matter seeds to the complex structures we observe at z=0. The role of mergers has been documented through both observations and simulations, numerous satellites that may represent these initial dark matter seeds have been discovered in the Local Group, high redshift galaxies have been revealed with monstrous star formation rates, and the gaseous cosmic web has been mapped through absorption line experiments. Despite these efforts, the dark matter simulations that include baryons are still unable to accurately reproduce galaxies. One of the major problems is our incomplete understanding of how a galaxy accretes its baryons and subsequently forms stars. Galaxy formation simulations have been unable to accurately represent the required gas physics on cosmological timescales, and observations have only just begun to detect the star formation fuel over a range of redshifts and environments. How galaxies obtain gas and subsequently form stars is a major unsolved, yet tractable problem in contemporary extragalactic astrophysics. In this paper we outline how progress can be made in this area in the next decade. },

	Abstract = {We present results from neutral hydrogen (H I) observations of the tip of the Magellanic Stream (MS), obtained with the Arecibo telescope as a part of the ongoing survey by the consortium for Galactic studies with the Arecibo L-band Feed Array. We find four large-scale, coherent H I streams, extending continuously over a length of 20&deg;, each stream possessing different morphology and velocity gradients. The newly discovered streams provide strong support for the tidal model of the MS formation by Connors et al. (2006), who suggested a spatial and kinematic bifurcation of the MS. The observed morphology and kinematics suggest that three of these streams could be interpreted as a three-way splitting of the main MS filament, while the fourth stream appears much younger and may have originated from the Magellanic Bridge. We find an extensive population of H I clouds at the tip of the MS. Two-thirds of clouds have an angular size in the range 3.5'-10'. We interpret this as being due to thermal instability, which would affect a warm tail of gas trailing through the Galactic halo over a characteristic timescale of a few Myr to a few hundred Myr. We show that thermal fragments can survive in the hot halo for a long time, especially if surrounded by a &lt;10<SUP>6</SUP> K halo gas. If the observed clumpy structure is mainly due to thermal instability, then the tip of the MS is at a distance of ~70 kpc. A significant fraction of H I clouds at the tip of the MS show multiphase velocity profiles, indicating the coexistence of cooler and warmer gas. },

	Abstract = {We examine the HI content and environment of all of the Local Group dwarf galaxies (Total Mass &lt; 10^10 Solar Masses), including the numerous newly discovered satellites of the Milky Way and M31. All of the new dwarfs, with the exception of Leo T, have no detected HI. The majority of dwarf galaxies within ~270 kpc of the Milky Way or Andromeda are undetected in HI (&lt; 10^4 Solar Masses for Milky Way dwarfs), while those further than ~270 kpc are predominantly detected with masses 10^5 to 10^8 Solar Masses. Analytical ram-pressure arguments combined with velocities obtained via proper motion studies allow for an estimate of the halo density of the Milky Way at several distances. This halo density is constrained to be greater than 2-3 x 10^-4 cm^-3 out to distances of at least 70 kpc. This is broadly consistent with theoretical models of the diffuse gas in a Milky Way-like halo and is consistent with this component hosting a large fraction of a galaxy's baryons. Accounting for completeness in the dwarf galaxy count, gas-less dwarf galaxies could have provided at most 2.1 x 10^8 Solar Masses of HI gas to the Milky Way, which suggests that most of our Galaxy's star formation fuel does not come from accreted small satellites in the current era. },

@article{Chiappini:2001,
	Abstract = {In this paper we adopt a chemical evolution model, which is an improved version of the Chiappini, Matteucci, &#38; Gratton model, assuming two main accretion episodes for the formation of the Galaxy, the first forming the halo and bulge in a short timescale and the second one forming the thin disk, with a timescale that is an increasing function of the Galactocentric distance (being of the order of 7 Gyrs at the solar neighborhood). The present model takes into account in more detail than previously the halo density distribution and explores the effects of a threshold density in the star formation process during both the halo and disk phases. The model also includes the most recent nucleosynthesis prescriptions concerning supernovae of all types, novae, and single stars dying as white dwarfs. In the comparison between model predictions and available data, we have focused our attention on abundance gradients as well as gas, stellar, and star formation rate distributions along the disk, since this kind of model has already proven to be quite successful in reproducing the solar neighborhood characteristics. We suggest that the mechanism for the formation of the halo leaves detectable imprints on the chemical properties of the outer regions of the disk, whereas the evolution of the halo and the inner disk are almost completely disentangled. This is due to the fact that the halo and disk densities are comparable at large Galactocentric distances and therefore the gas lost from the halo can substantially contribute to building up the outer disk. We also show that the existence of a threshold density for the star formation rate, both in the halo and disk phase, is necessary to reproduce the majority of observational data in the solar vicinity and in the whole disk. In particular, a threshold in the star formation implies the occurrence of a gap in the star formation at the halo-disk transition phase, in agreement with recent data. We conclude that a relatively short halo formation timescale (~=0.8 Gyr), in agreement with recent estimates for the age differences among Galactic globular clusters, coupled with an ``inside-out'' formation of the Galactic disk, where the innermost regions are assumed to have formed much faster than the outermost ones, represents, at the moment, the most likely explanation for the formation of the Milky Way. This scenario allows us to predict abundance gradients and other radial properties of the Galactic disk in very good agreement with observations. Moreover, as a consequence of the adopted ``inside-out'' scenario for the disk, we predict that the abundance gradients along the Galactic disk must have increased with time and that the average &lt;[alpha/Fe]&gt; ratios in stars (halo plus disk) slightly decrease going from 4 to 10 kpcs from the Galactic center. We also show that the same ratios increase substantially toward the outermost disk regions and the expected scatter in the stellar ages decreases, because the outermost regions are dominated by halo stars. More observations at large Galactocentric distances are needed to test these predictions. },

@article{Caldwell:2009,
	Abstract = {We present an updated catalog of 1300 objects in the field of M31, including 670 likely star clusters of various types, the rest being stars or background galaxies once thought to be clusters. The coordinates in the catalog are accurate to 0farcs2, and are based on images from the Local Group Survey (LGS) or from the Digitized Sky Survey (DSS). Archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images and the LGS were inspected to confirm cluster classifications where possible, but most of the classifications are based on spectra taken of ~1000 objects with the Hectospec fiber positioner and spectrograph on the 6.5 m MMT. The spectra and images of young clusters are analyzed in detail in this paper; analysis of older clusters will appear in a later paper. Ages and reddenings of 140 young clusters are derived by comparing the observed spectra with model spectra. Seven of these clusters also have ages derived from HST color-magnitude diagrams (two of which we present here); these agree well with the spectroscopically determined ages. Combining new V-band photometry with the M/L values that correspond to the derived cluster ages, we derive masses for the young clusters, finding them to have masses as great as 10<SUP>5</SUP> with a median of 10<SUP>4</SUP> M <SUB>sun</SUB>, and a median age of 0.25 Gyr. In comparison, therefore, Milky Way (MW) open clusters have the lowest median mass, the MW and M31 globulars the highest, and the LMC young massive clusters and the M31 young clusters are in between. The young clusters in M31 show a range of structures. Most have the low concentration typical of MW open clusters, but there are a few which have high concentrations. We expect that most of these young clusters will be disrupted in the next Gyr or so; however, some of the more massive and concentrated of the young clusters will likely survive for longer. The spatial distribution of the young clusters is well correlated with the star-forming regions as mapped out by mid-IR emission. A kinematic analysis likewise confirms the spatial association of the young clusters with the star-forming young disk in M31. },

@article{Perina:2009,
	Abstract = {Aims. We introduce our imaging survey of possible young massive globular clusters in M31 performed with the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We obtained shallow (to B&tilde; 25) photometry of individual stars in 20 candidate clusters. We present here details of the data reduction pipeline that is being applied to all the survey data and describe its application to the brightest among our targets, van den Bergh 0 (VdB0), taken as a test case.  Methods: Point spread function fitting photometry of individual stars was obtained for all the WFPC2 images of VdB0 and the completeness of the final samples was estimated using an extensive set of artificial stars experiments. The reddening, the age and the metallicity of the cluster were estimated by comparing the observed color magnitude diagram (CMD) with theoretical isochrones. Structural parameters were obtained from model-fitting to the intensity profiles measured within circular apertures on the WFPC2 images.  Results: Under the most conservative assumptions, the stellar mass of VdB0 is M&gt; 2.4 &#215; 10^4 M<SUB>o</SUB>, but our best estimates lie in the range ~=4{-}9 &#215; 10^4 M<SUB>o</SUB>. The CMD of VdB0 is best reproduced by models having solar metallicity and age ~= 25 Myr. Ages less than ~=12 Myr and greater than ~=60 Myr are clearly ruled out by the available data. The cluster has a remarkable number of red super giants (&gap;18) and a CMD very similar to Large Magellanic Cloud clusters usually classified as young globulars such as NGC 1850, for example.  Conclusions: VdB0 is significantly brighter (&gap;1 mag) than Galactic open clusters of similar age. Its present-day mass and half-light radius (r_h=7.4 pc) are more typical of faint globular clusters than of open clusters. However, given its position within the disk of M31, it is expected to be destroyed by dynamical effects, in particular by encounters with giant molecular clouds, within the next  4 Gyr.<p/>  Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA<p/>  Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute,<p/>  which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in<p/>  Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.<p/>  These observations are associated with program GO-10818 [P.I.: J.

	Abstract = {We explore the stellar population of M31 in a Spitzer Space Telescope survey utilizing IRAC and MIPS observations. Red supergiants are the brightest objects seen in the infrared; they are a prominent evolutionary phase. Due to their circumstellar envelopes, many of these radiate the bulk of their luminosity at IRAC wavelengths and do not stand out in the near-infrared or optically. Going fainter, we see large numbers of luminous asymptotic giant branch stars (AGB), many of which are known long-period variables. Relative to M33 the AGB carbon star population of M31 appears sparse, but this needs to be spectroscopically confirmed. },

	Abstract = {The structures of globular clusters (GCs) reflect their dynamical states and past histories. High-resolution imaging allows the exploration of morphologies of clusters in other galaxies. Surface brightness profiles from new Hubble Space Telescope observations of 34 GCs in M31 are presented, together with fits of several different structural models to each cluster. M31 clusters appear to be adequately fit by standard King models and do not obviously require alternate descriptions with relatively stronger halos, such as are needed to fit many GCs in other nearby galaxies. The derived structural parameters are combined with corrected versions of those measured in an earlier survey in order to construct a comprehensive catalog of structural and dynamical parameters for M31 GCs with a sample size similar to that for the Milky Way. Clusters in M31, the Milky Way, Magellanic Clouds, the Fornax dwarf spheroidal, and NGC 5128 define a very tight fundamental plane with identical slopes. The combined evidence for these widely different galaxies strongly reinforces the view that old GCs have near-universal structural properties, regardless of host environment.<p/>  Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.

	Abstract = {We discuss H and K observations of three fields in the bulge and disk of M31 obtained with the ALTAIR adaptive optics system and NIRI instrument on Gemini North. These are the highest resolution and deepest near-infrared observations obtained to date of the inner regions of M31 and demonstrate the promise of ground-based adaptive optics for studying the crowded regions of nearby galaxies. We have combined our observations with previously published Hubble Space Telescope Near-Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer observations of nine M31 fields and have derived the coarse star formation histories of M31's bulge and inner disk. From fits to the M<SUB>K</SUB> luminosity functions, we find the stellar population mix to be dominated by old, nearly solar-metallicity stars. The old populations, which we define as having age &gt;~6 Gyr, indeed dominate the star formation histories at all radii independent of the relative contributions of bulge and disk stars. Although all of our fields contain some bulge contribution, our results suggest that there is no age difference between the bulge and disk to the limit of our precision.<p/>  Based on observations obtained at the Gemini Observatory, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under a cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation (NSF) on behalf of the Gemini partnership: the NSF (United States), the Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council (United Kingdom), the National Research Council (Canada), CONICYT (Chile), the Australian Research Council (Australia), CNPq (Brazil), and CONICET (Argentina).

	Abstract = {We analyze the stellar populations present in M31 by using nine sets of adjacent Hubble Space Telescope NICMOS camera 1 and 2 fields with galactocentric distances ranging from 2' to 20'. These infrared observations provide some of the highest spatial resolution measurements of M31 to date; our data place tight constraints on the maximum luminosities of stars in the bulge of M31. The tip of the red giant branch is clearly visible at M<SUB>bol</SUB>~-3.8, and the tip of the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) extends to M<SUB>bol</SUB>~-5. This AGB peak luminosity is significantly fainter than previously claimed; through direct comparisons and simulations we show that previous measurements were affected by image blending. We do observe field-to-field variations in the luminosity functions, but simulations show that these differences can be produced by blending in the higher surface brightness fields. We conclude that the red giant branch of the bulge of M31 is not measurably different from that of the bulge of the Milky Way. We also find an unusually high number of bright bluish stars (7.3 arcmin<SUP>-2</SUP>), which appear to be Galactic foreground stars.<p/>  Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., for NASA under contract NAS 5-26555. },

	Abstract = {We present a structural analysis of NGC891, an edge-on galaxy that has long been considered to be an analogue of the Milky Way. Using starcounts derived from deep HST/ACS images, we detect the presence of a thick disk component in this galaxy with vertical scale height 1.44+/-0.03 kpc and radial scale length 4.8+/-0.1 kpc, only slightly longer than that of the thin disk. A stellar spheroid with a de Vaucouleurs-like profile is detected from a radial distance of 0.5 kpc to the edge of the survey at 25 kpc; the structure appears to become more flattened with distance, reaching q = 0.50 in the outermost halo region probed. The halo inside of 15 kpc is moderately metal-rich (median [Fe/H] ~ -1.1) and approximately uniform in median metallicity. Beyond that distance a modest chemical gradient is detected, with the median reaching [Fe/H] ~ -1.3 at 20 kpc. We find evidence for subtle, but very significant, small-scale variations in the median colour and density over the halo survey area. We argue that the colour variations are unlikely to be due to internal extinction or foreground extinction, and reflect instead variations in the stellar metallicity. Their presence suggests a startling conclusion: that the halo of this galaxy is composed of a large number of incompletely-mixed sub-populations, testifying to its origin in a deluge of small accretions. },

	Abstract = {We present deep ACS images of 3 fields in the edge-on disk galaxy NGC 891, which extend from the plane of the disk to 12 kpc, and out to 25 kpc along the major axis. The photometry of individual stars reaches 2.5 magnitudes below the tip of the RGB. We use the astrophotometric catalogue to probe the stellar content and metallicity distribution across the thick disk and spheroid of NGC 891. The CMDs of thick disk and spheroid population are dominated by old RGB stars with a wide range of metallicities, from a metal-poor tail at [Fe/H] ~ -2.4 dex, up to about half-solar metallicity. The peak of the MDF of the thick disk is at -0.9 dex. The inner parts of the thick disk, within 14 kpc along the major axis show no vertical colour/metallicity gradient. In the outer parts, a mild vertical gradient of Delta(V-I)/Delta|Z| = 0.1 +/- 0.05 kpc^-1 is detected. This gradient is however accounted for by the mixing with the metal poor halo stars. No metallicity gradient along the major axis is present for thick disk stars, but strong variations of about 0.35 dex around the mean of [Fe/H] = -1.13 dex are found. The properties of the asymmetric MDFs of the thick disk stars show no significant changes in both the radial and the vertical directions. The stellar populations at solar cylinder-like distances show strikingly different properties from those of the Galaxy, suggesting that the accretion histories of both galaxies have been different. The spheroid population shows remarkably uniform stellar population properties. The median metallicity of the halo stellar population shows a shallow gradient from about -1.15 dex in the inner parts to -1.27 dex at 24 kpc distance from the centre. Similar to the thick disk stars, large variations around the mean relation are present. },

	Abstract = {The unusual morphology of the Andromeda galaxy (Messier 31, the closest spiral galaxy to the Milky Way) has long been an enigma. Although regarded for decades as showing little evidence of a violent history, M31 has a well-known outer ring of star formation at a radius of ten kiloparsecs whose centre is offset from the galaxy nucleus. In addition, the outer galaxy disk is warped, as seen at both optical and radio wavelengths. The halo contains numerous loops and ripples. Here we report the presence of a second, inner dust ring with projected dimensions of 1.5&#215;1kiloparsecs and offset by about half a kiloparsec from the centre of the galaxy (based upon an analysis of previously-obtained data). The two rings appear to be density waves propagating in the disk. Numerical simulations indicate that both rings result from a companion galaxy plunging through the centre of the disk of M31. The most likely interloper is M32. Head-on collisions between galaxies are rare, but it appears nonetheless that one took place 210 million years ago in our Local Group of galaxies. },

	Abstract = {We present photometry from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 parallel imagery of a remote M31 field at a projected distance of ~34 kpc from the nucleus near the southwest major axis. This field is near the globular cluster G1, and near one of the candidate tidal plumes identified in the survey of Ferguson et al. (2002). The F606W (V) and F814W (I) images were obtained in parallel with STIS spectroscopy of G1 (GO-9099) and total 7.11 hr of integration time-the deepest HST field in the outer disk of M31 to date, reaching to V~28. The color-magnitude diagram of the field shows a clearly defined red clump at V=25.25 and a red giant branch consistent with [Fe/H]~-0.7. The lack of a blue horizontal branch contrasts with other M31 halo fields, the Andromeda dwarf spheroidals, and with the nearby globular cluster G1. Comparing the observed luminosity function to the Padova models, we find that at least some of the stellar population must be younger than 6-8 Gyr. The outermost detected neutral hydrogen disk of M31 lies only 2 kpc in projection from our field. The recent finding by Reitzel, Guhathakurta, &#38; Rich that some giants in the field have radial velocities close to that of the neutral hydrogen gas leads us to conclude that our field samples the old, low surface brightness disk rather than the true Population II spheroid or the remnants of a disrupted M31 satellite.<p/>  Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA Contract NAS 5-2655.

	Abstract = {Using the Advanced Camera for Surveys on board the Hubble Space Telescope, we have resolved individual red giant branch stars in the outskirts of the edge-on galaxy NGC 891, down to ~2 mag fainter than the tip of the red giant branch. The data set allows investigation of the stellar populations in the outer regions of an analogue galaxy to the Milky Way. We discuss the properties of the stellar populations located at ~10 kpc above the galaxy disc. We find that these extraplanar stellar populations exhibit a broad red giant branch star colour distribution, suggestive of a large spread in heavy element abundance. The mean stellar metallicity at this height from the galaxy disc, derived using the mean colours of red giant branch stars, is [Fe/H] ~ -0.9, a full ~0.5 dex more metal rich than the mean metallicity of the non-rotationally supported stars in the inner haloes of the Galaxy and Andromeda. This suggests that metal-poor stars are not the dominant stellar component in the outskirts of massive spiral galaxies. },

@article{Benedict:2009,
	Abstract = {Stellar mass plays a central role in our understanding of star formation and aging. Stellar astronomy is largely based on two maps, both dependent on mass, either indirectly or directly: the Hertzprung-Russell Diagram (HRD) and the Mass-Luminosity Relation (MLR). The extremes of both maps, while not terra incognita, are characterized by large uncertainties. A precise HRD requires precise distance obtained by direct measurement of parallax. A precise MLR requires precise measurement of binary orbital parameters, with the ultimate goal the critical test of theoretical stellar models. Such tests require mass accuracies of ~1%. Substantial improvement in both maps requires astrometry with microsecond of arc measurement precision. Why? First, the 'tops' of both stellar maps contain relatively rare objects, for which large populations are not found until the observing horizon reaches hundreds or thousands of parsecs. Second, the 'bottoms' and 'sides' of both maps contain stars, either intrinsically faint, or whose rarity guarantees great distance, hence apparent faintness. With an extensive collection of high accuracy masses that can only be provided by astrometry with microsecond of arc measurement precision, astronomers will be able to stress test theoretical models of stars at any mass and at every stage in their aging processes. },

	Abstract = {A sample of 4208 objects with magnitude 15&lt;g<SUP>*</SUP>&lt;22 and colors of main-sequence A stars have been selected from 370 deg<SUP>2</SUP> of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) commissioning observations. The data is from two long, narrow stripes, each with an opening angle of greater than 60&deg;, at Galactic latitudes 36<SUP>deg</SUP>&lt;|b|&lt;63<SUP>deg</SUP> on the celestial equator. Relative photometric calibrations good to 2% and consistent absolute photometry allows this uniform sample to be treated statistically over the large area. An examination of the sample's distribution shows that these stars trace considerable substructure in the halo. Large overdensities of A-colored stars in the north at (l, b, R)=(350<SUP>deg</SUP>, 50&deg;, 46 kpc) and in the south at (157, -58, 33 kpc) and extending over tens of degrees are present in the halo of the Milky Way. Ivezic et al. have detected the northern structure from a sample of RR Lyrae stars in the SDSS. Using photometry to separate the stars by surface gravity, both structures are shown to contain a sequence of low surface gravity stars consistent with identification as a blue horizontal branch (BHB). Both structures also contain a population of high surface gravity stars 2 mag fainter than the BHB stars, consistent with their identification as blue stragglers (BSs). The majority of the high surface gravity stars in the Galactic halo may be BS stars like these. A population of F stars associated with the A star excess in the southern structure is detected (the F stars in the northern structure at 46 kpc would be too faint for the SDSS to detect). From the numbers of detected BHB stars, lower limits to the implied mass of the structures are 6&#215;10<SUP>6</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB> and 2&#215;10<SUP>6</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB>, although one does not yet know the full spatial extent of the structures. The fact that two such large clumps have been detected in a survey of only 1% of the sky indicates that such structures are not uncommon in the halo. Simple spheroidal parameters are fit to a complete sample of the remaining unclumped BHB stars and yield (at r&lt;40 kpc) a fit to a halo distribution with flattening (c/a=0.65+/-0.2) and a density falloff exponent of alpha=-3.2+/-0.3. Based on observations obtained with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and with the Apache Point Observatory 3.5 m telescope, which is owned and operated by the Astrophysical Research Consortium. },

	Abstract = {We study the origin and properties of satellite galaxies within Milky Way size haloes as predicted in LCDM model, making use of hydrodynamic and N-body simulations as well as of three different semi-analytic models (SAMs) of galaxy formation. We extract merger trees from high-resolution N-body simulations of four Galaxy-sized DM haloes, and use these as common input for the SAMs. We present a detailed comparison of our predictions with the recent observational data on the Milky Way satellite luminosity function (LF). We find that semi-analytic models with rather standard astrophysical ingredients are able to reproduce the observed luminosity function over six orders of magnitude in luminosity, down to magnitudes as faint as M_V=-2. We also perform a comparison with the actual observed number of satellites as a function of luminosity, by applying the selection criteria of the SSDS to our simulations. We find good agreement for both the luminosity and radial distributions of MW satellites. We investigate which physical processes in our models are responsible for shaping the satellite LF, and find that tidal destruction, suppression of gas infall by a photo-ionizing background, and supernova feedback all make important contributions. For three of our dark matter haloes we have also run hydrodynamic simulations in which we also include gas cooling, star formation and stellar feedback. We find that the predictions of the numerical hydrodynamic simulations are in good agreement with those of the SAMs for the stellar mass function of satellites as well as for their radial distribution. We conclude that the number and luminosity of Milky Way satellites can be naturally accounted for within the LCDM paradigm, and this should no longer be considered a problem (abridged). },

	Abstract = {The unique dynamics of the tidal disruption of satellite galaxies is an extremely sensitive probe of long-range interactions between dark-matter particles. Dark-matter forces that are several percent the strength of gravity will lead to order unity changes in the ratio of the number of stars in the leading and trailing tidal streams of a satellite galaxy. The approximate symmetry of the stellar tidal streams of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy would thus exclude attractive dark-matter forces greater than 10% the strength of gravity which would entirely eliminate the leading stream. However, recent simulations suggest that dark-matter forces 100% the strength of gravity could completely strip the stellar component of Sagittarius of its dark matter, allowing for the subsequent development of symmetric tidal streams. Here we argue that these simulations use inconsistent initial conditions corresponding separate pure stellar and pure dark-matter satellites moving independently in the host galaxy's halo, rather than a single disrupting composite satellite as had been intended. Simulations with proper initial conditions would show that dark-matter forces this strong would most likely eject the satellite galaxy's stars from the host galaxy, not develop symmetric tidal streams like those of the Sagittarius dwarf. },

	Abstract = {We argue that, at least a fraction of the newly discovered population of ultra-faint dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the Local Group constitute the fossil relic of a once ubiquitous population of dwarf galaxies formed before reionization with circular velocities smaller than v<SUP>cr</SUP> <SUB>c</SUB> ~ 20 km s<SUP>--1</SUP>. We present several arguments in support of this model. The number of luminous Milky Way satellites inferred from observations is larger than the estimated number of dark halos in the Galaxy that have, or had in the past, a circular velocity greater than v<SUP>cr</SUP> <SUB>c</SUB> , as predicted by the "Via Lactea" simulation. This implies that some ultra-faint dwarfs are fossils. However, this argument is weakened by recent results from the "Aquarius" simulations showing that the number of Galactic dark matter satellites is 2.5 larger than previously believed. Secondly, the existence of a population of ultra-faint dwarfs was predicted by cosmological simulations in which star formation in the first minihalos is reduced---but not suppressed---by radiative feedback. Here, we show the statistical properties of the fossil galaxies in those simulations are consistent with observations of the new dwarf population and with the number and radial distribution of Milky Way satellites as a function of their luminosity. Finally, the observed Galactocentric distribution of dwarfs is consistent with a fraction of dwarf spheroidals being fossils. To make our case more compelling, future work should determine whether stellar chemical abundances of simulated "fossils" can reproduce observations and whether the tidal scenarios for the formation of Local Group dwarf spheroidals are equally consistent with all available observations. },

	Abstract = {Dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the Local Group are usually located close to the Milky Way or M31. Currently, there are two clear exceptions to this rule, and the Tucana dwarf galaxy is the most distant at almost 1 Mpc from the Milky Way. Using the VLT/FORS2 spectrograph in multi-object mode we were able to measure the velocities of 23 individual Red Giant Branch stars in and around Tucana using the Ca triplet absorption lines. From this sample 17 reliable members have been identified. We measured the systemic velocity and dispersion of Tucana to be v_hel = +194.0+-4.3 km/s and sigma_l.o.s. = 15.8+4.1-3.1 km/s respectively. These measures are derived after removing the signature of rotation using a linear gradient of 6.5 x R/R_core+-2.9 km/s, which corresponds to a rotation of 16 km/s at the reliable limit of our data. Our systemic velocity corresponds to a receding velocity from the barycentre of the Local Group of v_LG = +73.3 km/s. We also determined the mean metallicity of Tucana to be [Fe/H] = -1.95+-0.15 with a dispersion of 0.32+-0.06 dex. Our study firmly excludes any obvious association of Tucana with the HI emission in the vicinity and shows that Tucana is a genuine dwarf spheroidal, with low metallicity stars, no gaseous ISM and no recent star formation. The present location and relatively high recession velocity are consistent with Tucana having been an isolated Local Group galaxy for the majority of its existence. },

	Abstract = {The fact that dark matter (DM), thus far, has revealed itself only on scales of galaxies and larger, again thrusts onto astrophysics the opportunity and the responsibility to confront the age old mystery "What is the nature of matter?" By deriving basic data on the nature of DM - e.g., mass of its particle(s), present mean temperature, distribution in galaxies and other structures in the universe, and capacity for dissipational collapse - we will be uncovering the properties of the dominant species of matter in the universe and significantly extending the standard models of particle physics. Determining the mass of the DM particle to an order of magnitude would help to sort out the particle family to which it (or they) belongs. Beyond mass, there are issues of stability. The DM particle may be unstable with a measurable half-life, or it may become unstable after absorbing a certain amount of energy from collisions. In both cases it would contribute to the present hot dark matter component. Some key parameters of DM can most accurately be measured in the very nearby universe because DM dominates the mass in the outer Milky Way (MW), in other galaxies in the Local Group, and in the Local Group in its entirety. The presence and amount of DM can be quantified by study of dynamical processes observable in fine detail within these entities. Precise measurements of 3-D velocities for stars, coherent star streams, and stars in satellite stellar systems out to the edge of the Galaxy can reveal "what is the shape, orientation, density law, and lumpiness of the dark matter halo" as well as "what is the total mass of the Galaxy?" },

	Abstract = {We perform numerical simulations of a stellar galactic disk with initial conditions chosen to represent an unrelaxed population which might have been left following a merger. Stars are unevenly distributed in radial action angle, though the disk is axisymmetric. The velocity distribution in the simulated Solar neighborhood exhibits waves traveling in the direction of positive v, where u,v are the radial and tangential velocity components. As the system relaxes and structure wraps in phase space, the features seen in the uv-plane move closer together. We show that these results can be obtained also by a semi-analytical method. We propose that this model could provide an explanation for the high velocity streams seen in the Solar neighborhood at approximate v in km/s, of -60 (HR 1614), -80 (Arifyanto and Fuchs 2006), -100 (Arcturus), and -160 (Klement et al. 2008). In addition, we predict four new features at v ~ -140, -120, 40 and 60 km/s. By matching the number and positions of the observed streams, we estimate that the Milky Way disk was strongly perturbed ~1.9 Gyr ago. This event could have been associated with Galactic bar formation. },

	Abstract = {The Local Group dwarf galaxies offer a unique window to the detailed properties of the most common type of galaxy in the Universe. In this review, I update the census of Local Group dwarfs based on the most recent distance and radial velocity determinations. I then discuss the detailed properties of this sample, including (a) the integrated photometric parameters and optical structures of these galaxies, (b) the content, nature, and distribution of their interstellar medium (ISM), (c) their heavy-element abundances derived from both stars and nebulae, (d) the complex and varied star-formation histories of these dwarfs, (e) their internal kinematics, stressing the relevance of these galaxies to the "dark matter problem" and to alternative interpretations, and (f) evidence for past, ongoing, and future interactions of these dwarfs with other galaxies in the Local Group and beyond. To complement the discussion and to serve as a foundation for future work, I present an extensive set of basic observational data in tables that summarize much of what we know and still do not know about these nearby dwarfs. Our understanding of these galaxies has grown impressively in the past decade, but fundamental puzzles remain that will keep the Local Group at the forefront of galaxy evolution studies for some time. },

	Abstract = {We present a spectroscopic survey of candidate red giant branch stars in the extended star cluster, EC4, discovered in the halo of M31 from our CFHT/MegaCam survey, overlapping the tidal streams, Stream Cp and Stream Cr. These observations used the DEep Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph (DEIMOS) mounted on the Keck II telescope to obtain spectra around the CaII triplet region with ~1.3 Angstroms resolution. Six stars lying on the red giant branch within 2 core-radii of the centre of EC4 are found to have an average vr=-287.9^{+1.9}_{-2.4}km/s and velocity dispersion of 2.7^{+4.2}_{-2.7}km/s, taking instrumental errors into account. The resulting mass-to-light ratio for EC4 is M/L=6.7^{+15}_{-6.7}Msun/Lsun, a value that is consistent with a globular cluster within the 1 sigma errors we derive. From the summed spectra of our member stars, we find EC4 to be metal-poor, with [Fe/H]=-1.6+/-0.15. We discuss several formation and evolution scenarios which could account for our kinematic and metallicity constraints on EC4, and conclude that EC4 is most comparable with an extended globular cluster. We also compare the kinematics and metallicity of EC4 with Stream Cp and Stream Cr, and find that EC4 bears a striking resemblance to Stream Cp in terms of velocity, and that the two structures are identical in terms of both their spectroscopic and photometric metallicities. From this we conclude that EC4 is likely related to Stream Cp. },

@article{Sancisi:2008,
	Abstract = {Evidence for the accretion of cold gas in galaxies has been rapidly accumulating in the past years. H I observations of galaxies and their environment have brought to light new facts and phenomena which are evidence of ongoing or recent accretion: (1) A large number of galaxies are accompanied by gas-rich dwarfs or are surrounded by H I cloud complexes, tails and filaments. This suggests ongoing minor mergers and recent arrival of external gas. It may be regarded, therefore, as direct evidence of cold gas accretion in the local universe. It is probably the same kind of phenomenon of material infall as the stellar streams observed in the halos of our galaxy and M 31. (2) Considerable amounts of extra-planar H I have been found in nearby spiral galaxies. While a large fraction of this gas is undoubtedly produced by galactic fountains, it is likely that a part of it is of extragalactic origin. Also the Milky Way has extra-planar gas complexes: the Intermediate- and High-Velocity Clouds (IVCs and HVCs). (3) Spirals are known to have extended and warped outer layers of H I. It is not clear how these have formed, and how and for how long the warps can be sustained. Gas infall has been proposed as the origin. (4) The majority of galactic disks are lopsided in their morphology as well as in their kinematics. Also here recent accretion has been advocated as a possible cause. In our view, accretion takes place both through the arrival and merging of gas-rich satellites and through gas infall from the intergalactic medium (IGM). The new gas could be added to the halo or be deposited in the outer parts of galaxies and form reservoirs for replenishing the inner parts and feeding star formation. The infall may have observable effects on the disk such as bursts of star formation and lopsidedness. We infer a mean ``visible'' accretion rate of cold gas in galaxies of at least {0.2 M_{odot} year^{-1}} . In order to reach the accretion rates needed to sustain the observed star formation ({&ap; 1 M_{odot} year^{-1}}), additional infall of large amounts of gas from the IGM seems to be required. },

	Abstract = {Stellar halos may hold some of the best preserved fossils of the formation history of galaxies. They are a natural product of the merging processes that probably take place during the assembly of a galaxy, and hence may well be the most ubiquitous component of galaxies, independently of their Hubble type. This review focuses on our current understanding of the spatial structure, the kinematics and chemistry of halo stars in the Milky Way. In recent years, we have experienced a change in paradigm thanks to the discovery of large amounts of substructure, especially in the outer halo. I discuss the implications of the currently available observational constraints and fold them into several possible formation scenarios. Unraveling the formation of the Galactic halo will be possible in the near future through a combination of large wide field photometric and spectroscopic surveys, and especially in the era of Gaia. },

	Abstract = {We use N-body simulations to explore the origin and a plausible orbit for the Orphan Stream, one of the faintest substructures discovered so far in the outer halo of our Galaxy. We are able to reproduce its position, velocity and distance measurements by appealing to a single wrap of a double-component satellite galaxy. We find that the progenitor of the Orphan Stream could have been an object similar to today's Milky Way dwarfs, such as Carina, Draco, LeoII or Sculptor; and unlikely to be connected to Complex A or Ursa MajorII. Our models suggest that such progenitors, if accreted on orbits with apocentres smaller than ~35 kpc, are likely to give rise to very low surface brightness streams, which may be hiding in the outer halo and remain largely undetected with current techniques. The systematic discovery of these ghostly substructures may well require wide field spectroscopic surveys of the Milky Way's outer stellar halo. },

@article{Morrison:2009,
	Abstract = {Using a sample of 246 metal-poor stars (RR Lyraes, red giants, and red horizontal branch stars) which is remarkable for the accuracy of its six-dimensional kinematical data, we find, by examining the distribution of stellar orbital angular momenta, a new component for the local halo which has an axial ratio c/a ~ 0.2, a similar flattening to the thick disk. It has a small prograde rotation but is supported by velocity anisotropy, and contains more intermediate-metallicity stars (with --1.5 &lt; [Fe/H] &lt; --1.0) than the rest of our sample. We suggest that this component was formed quite late, during or after the formation of the disk. It formed either from the gas that was accreted by the last major mergers experienced by the Galaxy, or by dynamical friction of massive infalling satellite(s) with the halo and possibly the stellar disk or thick disk. The remainder of the halo stars in our sample, which are less closely confined to the disk plane, exhibit a clumpy distribution in energy and angular momentum, suggesting that the early, chaotic conditions under which the inner halo formed were not violent enough to erase the record of their origins. The clumpy structure suggests that a relatively small number of progenitors were responsible for building up the inner halo, in line with theoretical expectations. We find a difference in mean binding energy between the RR Lyrae variables and the red giants in our sample, suggesting that more of the RR Lyraes in the sample belong to the outer halo, and that the outer halo may be somewhat younger, as first suggested by Searle &#38; Zinn. We also find that the RR Lyrae mean rotation is more negative than the red giants, which is consistent with the recent result of Carollo et&#160;al. that the outer halo has a retrograde rotation and with the difference in kinematics seen between RR Lyraes and blue horizontal branch stars by Kinman et&#160;al. (2007). },

@article{Mateo:1998a,
	Abstract = {We have obtained deep photometric data in 24 fields along the southeast extension of the major axis of the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal (Sgr dSph) galaxy and in four fields along the northwest extension. Using star counts at the expected position of the Sgr upper main sequence within the resulting color-magnitude diagrams, we unambiguously detect Sgr stars in the southeast over the range 10 deg-34 deg from the galaxy's center. If Sgr is symmetric, this implies a true major-axis diameter of at least 68 deg, or nearly 30 kpc if all portions of Sgr are equally distant from the Sun. Star counts parallel to the galaxy's minor axis reveal that Sgr remains quite broad far from its center. This suggests that the outer portions of Sgr resemble a stream rather than an extension of the ellipsoidal inner regions of the galaxy. The inferred V-band surface brightness (SB) profile ranges from 27.3 to 30.5 mag arcsec^-2 over this radial range and exhibits a change in slope ~20 deg from the center of Sgr. The scale length of the outer SB profile is 17.2d, compared with 4.7d in the central region of Sgr. We speculate that this break in the SB profile represents a transition from the main body of Sgr to a more extended ``Sgr stream.'' By integrating the SB profile, we estimate that the absolute visual magnitude of Sgr lies in the range -13.4 to -14.6, depending on the assumed structure of Sgr; an upper limit to the luminosity of Sgr is therefore L~5.8x10^7 L_solar. This result lowers the M/L_V ratio inferred for Sgr down to ~10, which is consistent with values observed in the most luminous dSph companions of the Milky Way. },

	Abstract = {A catalog of southern anomalous-velocity H I clouds at decl. &lt; +2&deg; is presented. This catalog is based on data from the H I Parkes All-Sky Survey (HIPASS) reprocessed with the MINMED5 procedure and searched with a new high-velocity cloud-finding algorithm. The improved sensitivity (5 sigma: DeltaT<SUB>B</SUB>= 0.04 K), resolution (15.5'), and velocity range (-500 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>&lt;V<SUB>LSR</SUB>&lt;+500 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) of the HIPASS data result in a substantial increase in the number of individual clouds (1956, as well as 41 galaxies) compared with what was known from earlier southern data. The method of cataloging the anomalous-velocity objects is described, and a catalog of key cloud parameters, including velocity, angular size, peak column density, total flux, position angle, and degree of isolation, is presented. The data are characterized into several classes of anomalous-velocity H I emission. Most high-velocity emission features are HVCs and have a filamentary morphology and are loosely organized into large complexes extending over tens of degrees. In addition, 179 compact and isolated anomalous-velocity objects, CHVCs, are identified based on their size and degree of isolation. Of the CHVCs originally classified by Braun &#38; Burton, 25% are reclassified based on the HIPASS data. The properties of all the high-velocity emission features and only the CHVCs are investigated, and distinct similarities and differences are found. Both populations have typical H I masses of ~4.5D<SUP>2</SUP><SUB>kpc</SUB> M<SUB>solar</SUB> and have similar slopes for their column density and flux distributions. On the other hand, the CHVCs appear to be clustered and the population can be broken up into three spatially distinct groups, while the entire population of clouds is more uniformly distributed with a significant percentage aligned with the Magellanic Stream. The median velocities are V<SUB>GSR</SUB>=-38 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> for the CHVCs and -30 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> for all the anomalous-velocity clouds. Based on the catalog sizes, high-velocity features cover 19% of the southern sky, and CHVCs cover 1%. },

	Abstract = {The Milky Way has at least twenty-three known satellite galaxies that shine with luminosities ranging from about a thousand to a billion times that of the Sun. Half of these galaxies were discovered in the past few years in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and they are among the least luminous galaxies in the known Universe. A determination of the mass of these galaxies provides a test of galaxy formation at the smallest scales and probes the nature of the dark matter that dominates the mass density of the Universe. Here we use new measurements of the velocities of the stars in these galaxies to show that they are consistent with them having a common mass of about 10<SUP>7</SUP> within their central 300parsecs. This result demonstrates that the faintest of the Milky Way satellites are the most dark-matter-dominated galaxies known, and could be a hint of a new scale in galaxy formation or a characteristic scale for the clustering of dark matter. },

Imaging in the Washington M, T<SUB>2</SUB>, DDO51 system allows us to remove the background M31/M33 giants from our CMD and more clearly see the dwarf star feature, which has an MSTO near M~20.5. The corresponding stellar population shows little density variation over the 12<SUP>deg</SUP>&#215;6<SUP>deg</SUP> area of the sky sampled and is of very low surface brightness, Sigma&gt;32 mag arcsec<SUP>-2</SUP>. We show that this feature is not the same as a previously identified MS+MSTO in the foreground of the Andromeda galaxy that has been associated with the tidal stream ringing the Milky Way disk at less than half the distance. Thus, the new stellar system is a separate, more distant entity, perhaps a segment of tidal debris from a disrupted satellite galaxy. It is most likely related to the structure with similar distance, location, and density uniformity seen as an excess of K and M giants in the Two Micron All Sky Survey reported in the companion paper by Rocha-Pinto and coworkers. },

	Abstract = {In numerous studies of the outer Galactic halo some evidence for accretion has been found. If the outer halo did form in part or wholly through merger events, we might expect to find coherent streams of stars and globular clusters following orbits similar to those of their parent objects, which are assumed to be present or former Milky Way dwarf satellite galaxies. We present a study of this phenomenon by assessing the likelihood of potential descendant ``dynamical families'' in the outer halo. We conduct two analyses: one that involves a statistical analysis of the spatial distribution of all known Galactic dwarf satellite galaxies (DSGs) and globular clusters, and a second, more specific analysis of those globular clusters and DSGs for which full phase space dynamical data exist. In both cases our methodology is appropriate only to members of descendant dynamical families that retain nearly aligned orbital poles today. Since the Sagittarius dwarf (Sgr) is considered a paradigm for the type of merger/tidal interaction event for which we are searching, we also undertake a case study of the Sgr system and identify several globular clusters that may be members of its extended dynamical family. In our first analysis, the distribution of possible orbital poles for the entire sample of outer (R<SUB>gc</SUB>&gt;8 kpc) halo globular clusters is tested for statistically significant associations among globular clusters and DSGs. Our methodology for identifying possible associations is similar to that used by Lynden-Bell &#38; Lynden-Bell, but we put the associations on a more statistical foundation. Moreover, we study the degree of possible dynamical clustering among various interesting ensembles of globular clusters and satellite galaxies. Among the ensembles studied, we find the globular cluster subpopulation with the highest statistical likelihood of association with one or more of the Galactic DSGs to be the distant, outer halo (R<SUB>gc</SUB>&gt;25 kpc), second-parameter globular clusters. The results of our orbital pole analysis are supported by the great circle cell count methodology of Johnston, Hernquist, &#38; Bolte. The space motions of the clusters Pal 4, NGC 6229, NGC 7006, and Pyxis are predicted to be among those most likely to show the clusters to be following stream orbits, since these clusters are responsible for the majority of the statistical significance of the association between outer halo, second-parameter globular clusters and the Milky Way DSGs. In our second analysis, we study the orbits of the 41 globular clusters and six Milky Way-bound DSGs having measured proper motions to look for objects with both coplanar orbits and similar angular momenta. Unfortunately, the majority of globular clusters with measured proper motions are inner halo clusters that are less likely to retain memory of their original orbit. Although four potential globular cluster/DSG associations are found, we believe three of these associations involving inner halo clusters to be coincidental. While the present sample of objects with complete dynamical data is small and does not include many of the globular clusters that are more likely to have been captured by the Milky Way, the methodology we adopt will become increasingly powerful as more proper motions are measured for distant Galactic satellites and globular clusters, and especially as results from the Space Interferometry Mission (SIM) become available. },

	Abstract = {We have searched for in-falling stellar streams on to the local Milky Way disc in the CORrelation RAdial VELocities (CORAVEL) and RAdial Velocity Experiment (RAVE) surveys. The CORAVEL survey consists of local dwarf stars (N&#246;rdstrom et al. Geneva-Copenhagen survey) and local Famaey et al. giant stars. We select RAVE stars with radial velocities that are sensitive to the Galactic vertical space velocity (Galactic latitude b &lt; -45&deg;). Kuiper statistics have been employed to test the symmetry of the Galactic vertical velocity distribution functions in these samples for evidence of a net vertical flow that could be associated with a (tidal?) stream of stars with vertically coherent kinematics. In contrast to the `Field of Streams' found in the outer halo, we find that the local volumes of the solar neighbourhood sampled by the CORAVEL dwarfs (complete within ~3 &#215; 10<SUP>-4</SUP>kpc<SUP>3</SUP>), CORAVEL giants (complete within ~5 &#215; 10<SUP>-2</SUP>kpc<SUP>3</SUP>) and RAVE (5-15 per cent complete within ~8 kpc<SUP>3</SUP>) are devoid of any vertically coherent streams containing hundreds of stars. This is sufficiently sensitive to allow our RAVE sample to rule out the passing of the tidal stream of the disrupting Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf galaxy through the solar neighbourhood. This agrees with the most-recent determinations of its orbit and dissociates it from the Helmi et al. halo stream. Our constraints on the absence of the Sgr stream near the Sun could prove a useful tool for discriminating between Galactic potential models. The lack of a net vertical flow through the solar neighbourhood in the CORAVEL giants and RAVE samples argues against the Virgo overdensity crossing the disc near the Sun. There are no vertical streams in the CORAVEL giants and RAVE samples with stellar densities &gt;~1.6 &#215; 10<SUP>4</SUP> and 1.5 &#215; 10<SUP>3</SUP> stars kpc<SUP>-3</SUP>, respectively, and therefore no evidence for locally enhanced dark matter. },

	Abstract = {The GAIA astrometric mission has recently been approved as one of the next two ``cornerstones'' of ESA's science programme, with a launch date target of not later than mid-2012. GAIA will provide positional and radial velocity measurements with the accuracies needed to produce a stereoscopic and kinematic census of about one billion stars throughout our Galaxy (and into the Local Group), amounting to about 1 percent of the Galactic stellar population. GAIA's main scientific goal is to clarify the origin and history of our Galaxy, from a quantitative census of the stellar populations. It will advance questions such as when the stars in our Galaxy formed, when and how it was assembled, and its distribution of dark matter. The survey aims for completeness to V=20 mag, with accuracies of about 10 mu as at 15 mag. Combined with astrophysical information for each star, provided by on-board multi-colour photometry and (limited) spectroscopy, these data will have the precision necessary to quantify the early formation, and subsequent dynamical, chemical and star formation evolution of our Galaxy. Additional products include detection and orbital classification of tens of thousands of extra-Solar planetary systems, and a comprehensive survey of some 10<SUP>5</SUP>-10<SUP>6</SUP> minor bodies in our Solar System, through galaxies in the nearby Universe, to some 500 000 distant quasars. It will provide a number of stringent new tests of general relativity and cosmology. The complete satellite system was evaluated as part of a detailed technology study, including a detailed payload design, corresponding accuracy assesments, and results from a prototype data reduction development. },

	Abstract = {In this Letter, we study a localized stellar overdensity in the constellation of Ursa Major, first identified in Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data and subsequently followed up with Subaru imaging. Its color-magnitude diagram (CMD) shows a well-defined subgiant branch, main sequence, and turnoff, from which we estimate a distance of ~30 kpc and a projected size of ~250&#215;125 pc<SUP>2</SUP>. The CMD suggests a composite population with some range in metallicity and/or age. Based on its extent and stellar population, we argue that this is a previously unknown satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, hereby named Ursa Major II (UMa II) after its constellation. Using SDSS data, we find an absolute magnitude of M<SUB>V</SUB>~-3.8, which would make it the faintest known satellite galaxy. UMa II's isophotes are irregular and distorted with evidence for multiple concentrations; this suggests that the satellite is in the process of disruption.<p/>  Based in part on data collected at Subaru Telescope, which is operated by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan. },

	Abstract = {We have detected absorption lines from the high-velocity cloud (HVC) complex WB in the spectrum of the star HE 1048+0231. This detection sets an upper limit on the distance to the cloud of 8.8<SUP>+2.3</SUP><SUB>-1.3</SUB> kpc. Nondetection (at greater than 3 sigma confidence) in the star HE 1138-1303 at 7.7+/-0.2 kpc sets a probable lower limit. The equivalent width of the Ca II K line due to the HVC [W<SUB>lambda</SUB>(Ca II K)=114.6+/-4.4 m&#197;] corresponds to a column density of N(Ca II)=(1.32+/-0.05)&#215;10<SUP>12</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>. Using an H I spectrum from the Leiden/Argentine/Bonn survey, we calculate N(Ca II)/N(H I) = (81+/-16)&#215;10<SUP>-9</SUP>.

	Abstract = {The existence of blue straggler stars (BSSs) in dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) is still an open question. In fact, many BSS candidates have been observed in the Local Group dSphs, but it is unclear whether they are real BSSs or young stars. Shedding light on the nature of these BSS candidates is crucial, in order to understand the star formation history of dSphs. In this paper, we consider BSS candidates in Sculptor and Fornax. In Fornax there are strong hints that the BSS population is contaminated by young stars, whereas in Sculptor there is no clear evidence of recent star formation. We derive the radial and luminosity distribution of BSS candidates from wide field imaging data extending beyond the nominal tidal radius of these galaxies. The observations are compared with the radial distribution of BSSs expected from dynamical simulations. In Sculptor the radial distribution of BSS candidates is consistent with that of red horizontal branch (RHB) stars and is in agreement with theoretical expectations for BSSs generated via mass transfer in binaries. On the contrary, in Fornax the radial distribution of BSS candidates is more concentrated than that of all the considered stellar populations. This result supports the hypothesis that most of BSS candidates in Fornax are young stars and is consistent with previous studies. },

(1987) on the basis of integrated photometric measurements in the Beijing-Arizona-Taiwan-Connecticut (BATC) photometric system. Here, we present multicolor photometric CCD data (in the BATC system) for the remaining 39 M31 GCs and candidates. In addition, the ages of 35 GCs are constrained by comparing our accurate photometry with updated theoretical stellar synthesis models. We use photometric measurements from GALEX in the far- and near-ultraviolet and 2MASS infrared $JHK_s$ data, in combination with optical photometry. Except for two clusters, the ages of the other sample GCs are all older than 1 Gyr. Their age distribution shows that most sample clusters are younger than 6 Gyr, with a peak at ~3 Gyr, although the `usual' complement of well-known old GCs (i.e., GCs of similar age as the majority of the Galactic GCs) is present as well. },

	Abstract = {In the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy the globular clusters are distributed widely, without any significant central concentration. Oh et al. pointed out that such a distribution is paradoxical: dynamical friction effects estimated using single-component King models would have forced the globular clusters to spiral down to the center of the galaxy well within a Hubble time. This paper is devoted to a discussion of this paradox. We describe a model in which the stars of the dwarf spheroidal galaxy are embedded in a cloud of dark matter, and each of these components is specified by its own phase space distribution function. This model allows us to fit self-consistently the observed luminosity profile and the spatial variation of the velocity dispersion of the stars. This fitting yields two basic parameters, related to the central density and velocity dispersion, that characterize the phase space distribution of dark matter. The dynamical friction effects calculated on the basis of this self-consistent model are small enough that the observed spatial distribution of the globular clusters poses no difficulty, and the apparent paradox is resolved. Thus we have at hand a model for Fornax that reproduces the main observed features of this dwarf spheroidal galaxy. },

	Abstract = {We present the results of a survey of radial velocities over a wide region extending from r~10 arcmin out to r~80 arcmin (~1.5 tidal radii) within the massive star cluster omega Centauri. The survey was performed with FLAMES@VLT, to study the velocity dispersion profile in the outer regions of this stellar system. We derived accurate radial velocities for a sample of 2557 newly observed stars, identifying 318 bona-fide cluster red giants. Merging our data with those provided by Pancino et al. (2007), we assembled a final homogeneous sample of 946 cluster members that allowed us to trace the velocity dispersion profile from the center out to r~32 arcmin. The velocity dispersion appears to decrease monotonically over this range, from a central value of sigma_{v}~17.2 Km/s down to a minimum value of sigma_{v}~5.2 Km/s. The observed surface brightness profile, rotation curve, velocity dispersion profile and ellipticity profile are simultaneously well reproduced by a simple dynamical model in which mass follows light, within the classical Newtonian theory of gravitation. The comparison with an N-body model of the evolution of a system mimicking omega Cen during the last 10 orbits into the Galactic potential suggests that (a) the rotation of stars lying in the inner ~20 arcmin of the clusters is not due to the effects of the tidal field of the Milky Way, as hypothized by other authors, and (b) the overall observational scenario is still compatible with the possibility that the outer regions of the cluster are subject to some tidal stirring. },

	Abstract = {Most stars do not form in isolation but as part of a cluster comprising anywhere between a few dozen to several million stars with stellar densities ranging from 0.01 to several 10$^5$ \Msun pc$^{-3}$. The majority of these clusters dissolve within 20 Myr. The general assumption is that clusters are born more or less over this entire density range. A new analysis of cluster observations is presented. It demonstrates that, in fact, clustered star formation works under surprisingly tight constraints with respect to cluster size and density. The observed multitude of cluster densities simply results from snapshots of two sequences evolving in time along pre-defined tracks in the density-radius plane. This implies that the cluster size can actually be used to determine its age. },

	Abstract = {We have undertaken a deep, wide-field H I imaging survey of M31, reaching a maximum resolution of about 50 pc and 2 km s<SUP>--1</SUP> across a 95 &#215; 48 kpc region. The H I mass and brightness sensitivity at 100 pc resolution for a 25 km s<SUP>--1</SUP> wide spectral feature is 1500 M <SUB>sun</SUB> and 0.28 K. Our study reveals ubiquitous H I self-opacity features, discernible in the first instance as filamentary local minima in images of the peak H I brightness temperature. Local minima are organized into complexes of more than kpc length and are particularly associated with the leading edge of spiral arm features. Just as in the Galaxy, there is only patchy correspondence of self-opaque features with CO(1-0) emission. We have produced images of the best-fit physical parameters: spin temperature, opacity-corrected column density, and nonthermal velocity dispersion, for the brightest spectral feature along each line of sight in the M31 disk. Spectroscopically opaque atomic gas is organized into filamentary complexes and isolated clouds down to 100 pc. Localized opacity corrections to the column density exceed an order of magnitude in many cases and add globally to a 30% increase in the atomic gas mass over that inferred from the integrated brightness under the usual assumption of negligible self-opacity. Opaque atomic gas first increases from 20 to 60 K in spin temperature with radius to 12 kpc but then declines again to 20 K beyond 25 kpc. We have extended the resolved star formation law down to physical scales more than an order of magnitude smaller in area and mass than has been possible previously. The relation between total gas mass and star formation rate density is significantly tighter than that with molecular mass and is fully consistent in both slope and normalization with the power-law index of 1.56 found in the molecule-dominated disk of M51 at 500 pc resolution. Below a gas mass density of about 5 M <SUB>sun</SUB> pc<SUP>--2</SUP>, there is a downturn in star formation rate density which may represent a real local threshold for massive star formation at a cloud mass of about 5 &#215; 10<SUP>4</SUP> M <SUB>sun</SUB>. },

	Abstract = {We have found evidence for the presence of two distinct ancient stellar components (both &gt;=10 Gyr old) in the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy. We used the ESO Wide Field Imager in conjunction with the Very Large Telescope/FLAMES spectrograph to study the properties of the resolved stellar population of Sculptor out to and beyond the tidal radius. We find that two components are discernible in the spatial distribution of horizontal branch stars in our imaging and in the [Fe/H] and v<SUB>hel</SUB> distributions for our large sample of spectroscopic measurements. They can be generally described as a ``metal-poor'' component ([Fe/H]&lt;-1.7) and a ``metal-rich'' component ([Fe/H]&gt;-1.7). The metal-poor stars are more spatially extended than the metal-rich stars, and they also appear to be kinematically distinct. These results provide insight into the formation processes of small systems in the early universe and the conditions found there. Even this simplest of galaxies appears to have had a surprisingly complex early evolution.<p/>  Based on FLAMES observations collected at the ESO, proposals 71.B-0641 and 171.B-0588. },

	Abstract = {We investigate the relationship between several previously identified Galactic halo stellar structures in the direction of Virgo using imaging and spectroscopic observations of F turnoff stars and blue horizontal-branch stars from SDSS and SEGUE. We show that the Sagittarius dwarf leading tidal tail does not pass through the solar neighborhood; it misses the Sun by more than 15 kpc, passing through the Galactic plane outside the solar circle. Nor is it spatially coincident with the large stellar overdensity S297+63-20.5 in the Virgo constellation. S297+63-20.5 has a distinct turnoff color and kinematics. Faint (g<SUB>0</SUB>~20.3) turnoff stars in S297+63-20.5 have line-of-sight, Galactic standard of rest velocities V<SUB>gsr</SUB>=130+/-10 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, opposite in sign to infalling Sgr tail stars. The path of the Sgr leading tidal tail is also inconsistent with the positions of some of the nearer stars with which it has been associated and whose velocities have favored models with prolate Milky Way potentials. We also show that the number densities of brighter (g<SUB>0</SUB>~19.8) F turnoff stars are not symmetric about the Galactic center and that this discrepancy is not primarily due to the S297+63-20.5 moving group. Either the spheroid is asymmetric about the Galactic center or there are additional substructures that conspire to be on the same side of the Galaxy as S297+63-20.5. The S297+63-20.5 overdensity in Virgo is likely associated with two other previously identified Virgo substructures: the Virgo stellar stream (VSS) and the Virgo overdensity (VOD). However, the velocity difference between the VSS and S297+63-20.5 and the difference in distance estimates between the VOD and S297+63-20.5 must be reconciled. },

SEGUE obtained 3500 square degrees of additional ugriz imaging (primarily at low Galactic latitudes) providing precise multi-color photometry (g,r,i = 2%), (u,z = 3%) and astrometry (0.1 arcsec) for spectroscopic target selection. The stellar spectra, imaging data, and derived parameter catalogs for this survey are publicly available as part of SDSS Data Release 7 (DR7). },

	Abstract = {According to the hierarchical clustering scenario, galaxies are assembled by merging and accretion of numerous satellites of different sizes and masses. This ongoing process is not 100% efficient in destroying all of the accreted satellites, as evidenced by the satellites of our Galaxy and of M31. Using published data, we have compiled the circular velocity (V_circ) distribution function (VDF) of galaxy satellites in the Local Group. We find that within the volumes of radius of 570 kpc (400 h^-1 kpc assuming the Hubble constant h=0.7) centered on the Milky Way and Andromeda, the average VDF is roughly approximated as n(&gt;V_circ)~55+/-11(V_circ/10 km s^-1)^-1.4+/-0.4 h^3 Mpc^-3 for V_circ in the range ~10-70 km s^-1. The observed VDF is compared with results of high-resolution cosmological simulations. We find that the VDF in models is very different from the observed one: n(&gt;V_circ)~1200(V_circ/10 km s^-1)^-2.75 h^3 Mpc^-3. Cosmological models thus predict that a halo the size of our Galaxy should have about 50 dark matter satellites with circular velocity greater than 20 km s^-1 and mass greater than 3x10^8 M_solar within a 570 kpc radius. This number is significantly higher than the approximately dozen satellites actually observed around our Galaxy. The difference is even larger if we consider the abundance of satellites in simulated galaxy groups similar to the Local Group. The models predict ~300 satellites inside a 1.5 Mpc radius, while only ~40 satellites are observed in the Local Group. The observed and predicted VDFs cross at ~50 km s^-1, indicating that the predicted abundance of satellites with V_circ&gt;~50 km s^-1 is in reasonably good agreement with observations. We conclude, therefore, that unless a large fraction of the Local Group satellites has been missed in observations, there is a dramatic discrepancy between observations and hierarchical models, regardless of the model parameters. We discuss several possible explanations for this discrepancy including identification of some satellites with the high-velocity clouds observed in the Local Group and the existence of dark satellites that failed to accrete gas and form stars either because of the expulsion of gas in the supernovae-driven winds or because of gas heating by the intergalactic ionizing background. },

	Abstract = {We use numerical simulations to examine the substructure within galactic and cluster mass halos that form within a hierarchical universe. Clusters are easily reproduced with a steep mass spectrum of thousands of substructure clumps that closely matches the observations. However, the survival of dark matter substructure also occurs on galactic scales, leading to the remarkable result that galaxy halos appear as scaled versions of galaxy clusters. The model predicts that the virialized extent of the Milky Way's halo should contain about 500 satellites with circular velocities larger than the Draco and Ursa Minor systems, i.e., bound masses &gt;~10^8 M_solar and tidally limited sizes &gt;~1 kpc. The substructure clumps are on orbits that take a large fraction of them through the stellar disk, leading to significant resonant and impulsive heating. Their abundance and singular density profiles have important implications for the existence of old thin disks, cold stellar streams, gravitational lensing, and indirect/direct detection experiments. },

	Abstract = {We consider the possibility that the Magellanic Clouds were the largest members of a group of dwarf galaxies that entered the Milky Way (MW) halo at late times. Seven of the eleven brightest satellites of the MW may have been part of this system. The proximity of some dwarfs to the plane of the orbit of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) has been used to argue that they formed from tidal debris from the LMC and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Instead, they may owe to the tidal breakup of the Magellanic group. This can explain the association of many of the dwarf galaxies in the Local Group with the LMC system. It provides a mechanism for lighting up dwarf galaxies and reproduces the bright end of the cumulative circular velocity distribution of the satellites in the MW without invoking a stripping scenario for the subhalos to match the satellite distribution expected according to CDM theory. Finally, our model predicts that other isolated dwarfs will be found to have companions. Evidence for this prediction is provided by nearby, recently discovered dwarf associations. },

	Abstract = {Astronomical software is now a fact of daily life for all hands-on members of our community. Purpose-built software for data reduction and modeling tasks becomes ever more critical as we handle larger amounts of data and simulations. However, the writing of astronomical software is unglamorous, the rewards are not always clear, and there are structural disincentives to releasing software publicly and to embedding it in the scientific literature, which can lead to significant duplication of effort and an incomplete scientific record. We identify some of these structural disincentives and suggest a variety of approaches to address them, with the goals of raising the quality of astronomical software, improving the lot of scientist-authors, and providing benefits to the entire community, analogous to the benefits provided by open access to large survey and simulation datasets. Our aim is to open a conversation on how to move forward. We advocate that: (1) the astronomical community consider software as an integral and fundable part of facility construction and science programs; (2) that software release be considered as integral to the open and reproducible scientific process as are publication and data release; (3) that we adopt technologies and repositories for releasing and collaboration on software that have worked for open-source software; (4) that we seek structural incentives to make the release of software and related publications easier for scientist-authors; (5) that we consider new ways of funding the development of grass-roots software; (6) and that we rethink our values to acknowledge that astronomical software development is not just a technical endeavor, but a fundamental part of our scientific practice. },

	Abstract = {We construct a new sample of ~1800 solar neighbourhood halo subdwarfs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, selected using a reduced proper motion diagram. Radial velocities come from the SDSS spectra and proper motions from the light-motion curve catalogue of Bramich et al. (2008). Using a photometric parallax relation to estimate distances gives us the full phase-space coordinates. Typical velocity errors are in the range 30-50 km/s. This halo sample is one of the largest constructed to-date and the disc contamination is at a level of &lt; 0.1 per cent. This enables us to calculate the halo velocity dispersion to excellent accuracy. We find that the velocity dispersion tensor is aligned in spherical polar coordinates and that (sigma_r, sigma_phi, sigma_theta) = (142 \pm 2, 81 \pm 2, 77 \pm 2) km/s. The stellar halo exhibits no net rotation, although the distribution of v_phi shows tentative evidence for asymmetry. The kinematics are consistent with a mildly flattened stellar density falling with distance like r^{-3.8}. Using the full phase-space coordinates, we look for signs of kinematic substructure in the stellar halo. We find evidence for four discrete overdensities localised in angular momentum and suggest that they may be possible accretion remnants. The most prominent is the solar neighbourhood stream previously identified by Helmi et al. (1999), but the remaining three are new. One of these overdensities is potentially associated with a group of four globular clusters (NGC5466, NGC6934, M2 and M13) and raises the possibility that these could have been accreted as part of a much larger progenitor. },

	Abstract = {We have detected stellar halo streams in the solar neighborhood using data from the 7th public data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), which includes the directed stellar program SEGUE: Sloan Extension For Galactic Understanding and Exploration. In order to derive distances to each star, we used the metallicity-dependent photometric parallax relation from Ivezic et al. (2008) for which we examine and quantify the accuracy. Our final sample consists of 22,321 nearby (d &lt; 2 kpc), metal-poor ([Fe/H] &lt; -0.5) main-sequence stars with 6D estimates of position and space velocity. We characterize the orbits of these stars through suitable kinematic proxies for their "effective" integrals of motion, angular momentum, eccentricity, and orbital polar angle and compare the observed distribution to expectations from a smooth distribution in four [Fe/H] bins. On this basis we identify at least five significant "phase-space overdensities" of stars on very similar orbits in the solar neighborhood to which we can assign unambiguously peaked [Fe/H] distributions. Three of them have been identified previously, including the halo stream discovered by Helmi et al. (1999) at a significance level of 12.0. In addition, we find at least two new genuine halo streams, judged by their kinematics and [Fe/H], at significance levels of 2.9 and 4.8, respectively. For one stream the stars even show coherence in configuration space, matching a spatial overdensity of stars found by Juric et al. (2008) at (R,z) \approx (9.5,0.8) kpc. Our results demonstrate the practical power of our search method to detect substructure in the phase-space distribution of nearby stars without making a-priori assumptions about the detailed form of the gravitational potential. },

	Abstract = {Cold dark matter theory predicts that the Local Group should contain many more dwarf-sized objects than the observed number of dwarf galaxies-the so-called substructure problem. We investigate whether the suppression of star formation in these small objects due to the presence of a photoionizing background can resolve the problem. We make use of results from recent hydrodynamic simulations to build a recipe for the suppression of gas infall into semianalytic galaxy formation models and use these to predict the luminosity function of dwarf galaxies in the Local Group. In the models without photoionization ``squelching,'' we predict a large excess of faint dwarf galaxies compared with the observed number in the Local Group-thus, the usual recipe for supernova feedback used in semianalytic models does not solve the substructure problem on its own. When we include photoionization squelching, we find good agreement with the observations. We have neglected tidal destruction, which probably further reduces the number of dwarf galaxies. We conclude that photoionizing squelching easily solves the substructure problem. In fact, it is likely that once this effect is taken into account, models with reduced small-scale power (e.g., warm dark matter) would underproduce dwarf galaxies. },

	Abstract = {We report the first determination of a distance bracket for the high-velocity cloud (HVC) complex C. Combined with previous measurements showing that this cloud has a metallicity of 0.15 times solar, these results provide ample evidence that complex C traces the continuing accretion of intergalactic gas falling onto the Milky Way. Accounting for both neutral and ionized hydrogen as well as He, the distance bracket implies a mass of (3-14)&#215;10<SUP>6</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB>, and the complex represents a mass inflow of 0.1-0.25 M<SUB>solar</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. We base our distance bracket on the detection of Ca II absorption in the spectrum of the blue horizontal branch (BHB) star SDSS J120404.78+623345.6, in combination with a significant nondetection toward the BHB star BS 16034-0114. These results set a strong distance bracket of 3.7-11.2 kpc on the distance to complex C. A more weakly supported lower limit of 6.7 kpc may be derived from the spectrum of the BHB star BS 16079-0017. },

	Abstract = {We study the evolution of satellite debris to establish the most suitable space to identify past merger events. We find that the space of orbital frequencies is very promising in this respect. In frequency space individual streams can be easily identified, and their separation provides a direct measurement of the time of accretion. We are able to show for a few idealised gravitational potentials that these features are preserved also in systems that have evolved strongly in time. Furthermore, this time evolution is imprinted in the distribution of streams in frequency space. We have also tested the power of the orbital frequencies in a fully self-consistent (live) N-body simulation of the merger between a disk galaxy and a massive satellite. Even in this case streams can be easily identified and the time of accretion of the satellite can be accurately estimated. },

	Abstract = {The high- and intermediate-velocity interstellar clouds (HVCs/IVCs) are tracers of energetic processes in and around the Milky Way. Clouds with near-solar metallicity about 1 kpc above the disk trace the circulation of material between disk and halo (the Galactic fountain). The Magellanic Stream consists of gas tidally extracted from the SMC, tracing the dark matter potential of the Milky Way. Several other HVCs have low metallicity and appear to trace the continuing accretion of infalling intergalactic gas. These assertions are supported by the metallicities (0.1 to 1 solar) measured for about 10 clouds in the past decade. Direct measurements of distances to HVCs have remained elusive, however. In this paper we present four new distance brackets, using VLT observations of interstellar Ca II H and K absorption toward distant Galactic halo stars. We derive distance brackets of 5.0 to 11.7 kpc for the Cohen Stream (likely to be an infalling low-metallicity cloud), 9.8 to 15.1 kpc for Complex GCP (also known as the Smith Cloud or HVC 40-15+100 and with still unknown origin), 1.0 to 2.7 kpc for an IVC that appears associated with the return flow of the fountain in the Perseus arm, and 1.8 to 3.8 kpc for cloud g1, which appears to be in the outflow phase of the fountain. Our measurements further demonstrate that the Milky Way is accreting substantial amounts of gaseous material, which influences the Galaxy's current and future dynamical and chemical evolution.<p/>  Based on observations carried out at the European Southern Observatory (ESO), La Silla, under program ID 077.B-0359 (PI: P.

	Abstract = {We suggest that the high-velocity clouds (HVCs) are large clouds, with typical diameters of 25 kpc, containing 3x10^7 M_solar of neutral gas and 3x10^8 M_solar of dark matter, falling onto the Local Group; altogether the HVCs contain 10^10 M_solar of neutral gas. Our reexamination of the Local Group hypothesis for the HVCs connects their properties to the hierarchical structure formation scenario and to the gas seen in absorption toward quasars. We show that at least one HVC complex (besides the Magellanic Stream) must be extragalactic at a distance of more than 40 kpc from the Galactic center, with a diameter greater than 20 kpc and a mass of more than 10^8 M_solar. We discuss a number of other clouds that are positionally associated with the Local Group galaxies, and we show that the entire ensemble of HVCs is inconsistent with a Galactic origin. The observed kinematics imply rather that the HVCs are falling toward the Local Group barycenter. We simulate the dynamical evolution of the Local Group and find that material falling onto the Local Group reproduces the location of two of the three most significant groupings of clouds and the kinematics of the entire cloud ensemble (excluding the Magellanic Stream). We interpret the third grouping (the A, C, and M complexes) as the nearest HVC. It is tidally unstable and is falling onto the Galactic disk. We interpret the more distant HVCs as gas contained within dark matter ``minihalos'' moving along filaments toward the Local Group. Most poor galaxy groups should contain similar H I clouds bound to the group at large distances from the individual galaxies. We suggest that the HVCs are local analogs of the Lyman limit absorbing clouds observed against distant quasars. Our picture implies that the chemical evolution of the Galactic disk is governed by episodic infall of metal-poor HVC gas that only slowly mixes with the rest of the interstellar medium. We argue that there is a Galactic fountain in the Milky Way, but that the fountain does not explain the origin of the HVCs. Our analysis of the H I data leads to the detection of a vertical infall of low-velocity gas toward the plane and implies that the H I disk is not in hydrostatic equilibrium. We suggest that the fountain is manifested mainly by relatively local neutral gas with characteristic velocities of 6 km s^-1 rather than 100 km s^-1. The Local Group infall hypothesis makes a number of testable predictions. The HVCs should have subsolar metallicities. Their Halpha emission should be less than that seen from the Magellanic Stream. The clouds should not be seen in absorption against nearby stars. The clouds should be detectable in both emission and absorption around other galaxy groups. We show that current observations are consistent with these predictions and discuss future tests. },

	Abstract = {We present H I observations of the edge-on galaxy NGC 891. These are among the deepest ever performed on an external galaxy. They reveal a huge gaseous halo, much more extended than seen previously and containing almost 30% of the H I. This H I halo shows structures on various scales. On one side, there is a filament extending (in projection) up to 22 kpc vertically from the disk. Small (M gtrsim 10<SUP>6</SUP> M<SUB>odot</SUB>) halo clouds, some with forbidden (apparently counterrotating) velocities, are also detected. The overall kinematics of the halo gas is characterized by differential rotation lagging with respect to that of the disk. The lag, more pronounced at small radii, increases with height from the plane. There is evidence that a significant fraction of the halo is due to a galactic fountain. Accretion from intergalactic space may also play a role in building up the halo and providing the low angular momentum material needed to account for the observed rotation lag. The long H I filament and the counterrotating clouds may be direct evidence of such accretion. },

	Abstract = {We present the discovery of four remote star clusters in M33, one of which is of an extended nature. Three of the clusters were discovered using survey data from the Isaac Newton Telescope Wide-Field Camera while one was discovered serendipitously in a deep image taken with the Hubble Space Telescope's Advanced Camera for Surveys. With projected radii of 38-113 arcmin (9.6-28.5 kpc for an assumed M33 distance of 870 kpc), these clusters lie significantly beyond all but one of the currently-confirmed clusters in M33. The clusters have magnitudes and colors consistent with their being old to intermediate-age globular clusters. Indeed, they bear a strong resemblance to the outer halo GC population of the Milky Way and M31 in terms (V-I)o colors. The three outermost clusters are projected on the far side of M33 with respect to M31, an asymmetry that could suggest tidal interactions have affected M33's globular cluster distribution at large radii. },

@article{Brewer:2006,
	Abstract = {We have studied 23 long-lived G dwarfs that belong to the thin disk and thick disk stellar populations. The stellar data and analyses are identical, reducing the chances for systematic errors in the comparisons of the chemical abundance patterns in the two populations. Abundances have been derived for 24 elements: O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Sc, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, La, Ce, Nd, and Eu. We find that the behavior of [alpha/Fe] and [Eu/Fe] versus [Fe/H] are quite different for the two populations. As has long been known, the thin disk O, Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti ratios are enhanced relative to iron at the lowest metallicities and decline toward solar values as [Fe/H] rises above -1.0. For the thick disk, the decline in [alpha/Fe] and [Eu/Fe] does not begin at [Fe/H]=-1.0, but at -0.4. Other elements share this same behavior, including Sc, Co, and Zn, suggesting that at least in the chemical enrichment history of the thick disk, these elements were manufactured in similar-mass stars. The heavy s-process elements Ba, La, Ce, and Nd are overabundant in the thin disk stars relative to the thick disk stars. On the other hand, the constancy of the [Ba/Y] ratio suggests that only one s-process site was manufacturing these elements or, possibly, that the r-process was responsible for the bulk of the nucleosynthesis of these elements. We combine our results with other studies (Edvardsson et al., Prochaska et al., Bensby et al., and Reddy et al.), who had already found very similar trends, in order to further explore the origin of the thick disk. The signs for an independent (parent galaxy) evolution of the thick disk are clear, in terms of the different metallicities at which the [alpha/Fe] ratios begin to decline, as well as the ``step function'' behavior of some elements, including [Eu/Y], [Ba/Fe], and possibly [Cu/Fe], at [Fe/H]~-0.2. },

	Abstract = {A suite of high-resolution N-body simulations of the Magellanic Clouds-Milky Way system are presented and compared directly with newly available data from the HI Parkes All-Sky Survey (HIPASS). We show that the interaction between Small Magellanic Clouds (SMC) and Large Magellanic Clouds results in both a spatial and kinematical bifurcation of both the stream and the leading arm. The spatial bifurcation of the stream is readily apparent in the HIPASS data, and the kinematical bifurcation is also tentatively identified. This bifurcation provides strong support for the tidal disruption origin for the Magellanic stream. A fiducial model for the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) is presented upon completion of an extensive parameter survey of the potential orbital configurations of the MCs and the viable initial boundary conditions for the disc of the SMC. The impact of the choice of these critical parameters upon the final configurations of the stream and leading arm is detailed. },

	Abstract = {As part of the ACS Survey of Galactic Globular Clusters, we present new Hubble Space Telescope photometry of the massive globular cluster M54 (NGC 6715) and the superposed core of the tidally disrupted Sagittarius (Sgr) dSph galaxy. Our deep (F606W ~ 26.5), high-precision photometry yields an unprecedentedly detailed color-magnitude diagram showing the extended blue horizontal branch and multiple main sequences of the M54+Sgr system. The distance and reddening to M54 are revised using both isochrone and main-sequence fitting to (m-M)<SUB>0</SUB>=17.27 and E(B-V)=0.15. Preliminary assessment finds the M54+Sgr field to be dominated by the old metal-poor populations of Sgr and the globular cluster. Multiple turnoffs indicate the presence of at least two intermediate-aged star formation epochs with 4 and 6 Gyr ages and [Fe/H]=-0.4 to -0.6. We also clearly show, for the first time, a prominent, ~2.3 Gyr old Sgr population of near-solar abundance. A trace population of even younger (~0.1-0.8 Gyr old), more metal-rich ([Fe/H]~0.6) stars is also indicated. The Sgr age-metallicity relation is consistent with a closed-box model and multiple (4-5) star formation bursts over the entire life of the satellite, including the time since Sgr began disrupting.<p/>  This is the fourth paper in the series based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555, under program GO-10775 (PI: A.

	Abstract = {We report preliminary results of a project to homogeneously measure star formation histories for the majority of Local Group dwarf galaxies, based on archival WFPC2 observations. For the dwarf spheroidal and elliptical galaxies, we find that the more luminous systems all show extended star formation episodes, while the less luminous systems typically formed most of their stars over ten Gyr ago. Irregular galaxies show no comparable trend. We find that a galaxy's classification as an irregular or spheroidal is entirely explained by its star formation within the past Gyr or less. Several elliptical/spheroidal systems actively formed stars within the past two Gyr, and would have been indistinguishable from present-day irregulars if observed two Gyr ago. },

	Abstract = {We present a database (LOGPHOT) of stellar photometry of Local Group galaxies obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope using the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2). The database includes photometry from all WFPC2 observations taken through 2003 with long exposures (&gt;500 s) in F555W and F814W, and many observations in which long exposures were taken in at least two broadband filters. We have attempted to derive and use techniques that produce the best photometry; the database has been fully populated using the HSTphot photometry package. To test the effects of different techniques, independent reductions were made for a few fields, and the comparison of these highlights some important issues and gives an estimate of plausible errors; these tests also led to some minor modifications and improvements to HSTphot. We provide both point-spread function photometry and subtracted-frame aperture photometry and discuss the merits of each. The database is available electronically. In addition to discussing the techniques used to construct the database, we present color-magnitude diagrams from single fields in each of the Local Group galaxies that have been observed; these provide an educational and visual display of the variety of star formation histories observed in Local Group galaxies.<p/>  Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA), Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555. },

In the cluster core, we find that the cluster's SGB exhibits a clear spread in luminosity, with at least two distinct components: a brighter one with a spread that is real but not bimodal, and a second one about 0.05 mag fainter, containing about 10% of the stars. In a less crowded field 6 arcminutes from the center, we find that the MS is broadened much more than can be accounted for by photometric errors, and that this broadening increases at fainter magnitudes. },

	Abstract = {We report on the detection of a population of weak metal-line absorbers in the halo or nearby intergalactic environment of the Milky Way. Using high-resolution ultraviolet absorption-line spectra of bright quasars (QSO) obtained with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS), along six sight lines we have observed unsaturated, narrow absorption in O I and Si II, together with mildly saturated C II absorption at high radial velocities (|v <SUB>LSR</SUB>| = 100-320 km&#160;s<SUP>--1</SUP>). The measured O I column densities lie in the range N(O I) &lt; 2 &#215; 10<SUP>14</SUP> cm<SUP>--2</SUP> implying that these structures represent Lyman limit Systems and sub-Lyman limit System with H I column densities between 10<SUP>16</SUP> and 3 &#215; 10<SUP>18</SUP> cm<SUP>--2</SUP>, thus below the detection limits of current 21 cm all-sky surveys of high-velocity clouds (HVCs). The absorbers apparently are not directly associated with any of the large high column density HVC complexes, but rather represent isolated, partly neutral gas clumps embedded in a more tenuous, ionized gaseous medium situated in the halo or nearby intergalactic environment of the Galaxy. Photoionization modeling of the observed low ion ratios suggests typical hydrogen volume densities of n <SUB>H</SUB> &gt; 0.02 cm<SUP>--3</SUP> and characteristic thicknesses of a several parsec down to subparsec scales. For three absorbers, metallicities are constrained in the range of 0.1-1.0 solar, implying that these gaseous structures may have multiple origins inside and outside the Milky Way. Using supplementary optical absorption-line data, we find for two other absorbers Ca II/O I column-density ratios that correspond to solar Ca/O abundance ratios. This finding indicates that these clouds do not contain significant amounts of dust. This population of low column density gas clumps in the circumgalactic environment of the Milky Way is indicative of the various processes that contribute to the circulation of neutral gas in the extended halos of spiral galaxies. These processes include the accretion of gas from the intergalactic medium and satellite galaxies, galactic fountains, and outflows. We speculate that this absorber population represents the local analog of weak Mg II systems that are commonly observed in the circumgalactic environment of low- and high-redshift galaxies.<p/>  Based on observations obtained with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, which is operated by the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) for the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS5D26555. },

	Abstract = {We present a method to determine the star formation history of a mixed stellar population from its photometry. We perform a chi<SUP>2</SUP> minimization between the observed photometric distribution and a model photometric distribution, based on theoretical isochrones. The initial mass function, distance modulus, interstellar reddening, binary fraction, and photometric errors are incorporated into the model, making it directly comparable to the data. The model is a linear combination of individual synthetic color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), each of which represents the predicted photometric distribution of a stellar population of a given age and metallicity. While the method is similar to existing synthetic CMD algorithms, we describe several key improvements in our implementation. In particular, we focus on the derivation of accurate error estimates on the star formation history to enable comparisons between such histories, either from different objects or from different regions of a single object. We present extensive tests of the algorithm, using both simulated and actual photometric data. From a preliminary application of the algorithm to a subregion of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), we find that the that the lull in star formation observed among the LMC's cluster population between 3 and 8 Gyr ago is also present in the field population. The method was designed with flexibility and generality in mind, and we make the code available for use by the astronomical community. },

@article{Lee:1999,
	Abstract = {The discovery of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, which is being tidally disrupted by and merging with the Milky Way, supports the view that the halo of the Galaxy has been built up at least partially by the accretion of similar dwarf systems. The Sagittarius dwarf contains several distinct populations of stars, and includes M54 as its nucleus, which is the second most massive globular cluster associated with the Milky Way. The most massive globular cluster is omega Centauri, and here we report that omega Centauri also has several distinct stellar populations, as traced by red-giant-branch stars. The most metal-rich red-giant-branch stars are about 2Gyr younger than the dominant metal-poor component, indicating that omega Centauri was enriched over this timescale. The presence of more than one epoch of star formation in a globular cluster is quite surprising, and suggests that omega Centauri was once part of a more massive system that merged with the Milky Way, as the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy is in the process of doing now. Mergers probably were much more frequent in the early history of the Galaxy and omega Centauri appears to be a relict of this era. },

@article{Wakker:1999,
	Abstract = {Models of the chemical evolution of the Milky Way suggest that the observed abundances of elements heavier than helium (`metals') require a continuous infall of gas with metallicity (metal abundance) about 0.1 times the solar value. An infall rate integrated over the entire disk of the Milky Way of ~1 solar mass per year can solve the `G-dwarf problem'-the observational fact that the metallicities of most long-lived stars near the Sun lie in a relatively narrow range. This infall dilutes the enrichment arising from the production of heavy elements in stars, and thereby prevents the metallicity of the interstellar medium from increasing steadily with time. However, in other spiral galaxies, the low-metallicity gas needed to provide this infall has been observed only in associated dwarf galaxies and in the extreme outer disk of the Milky Way. In the distant Universe, low-metallicity hydrogen clouds (known as `damped Lyalpha absorbers') are sometimes seen near galaxies. Here we report a metallicity of 0.09 times solar for a massive cloud that is falling into the disk of the Milky Way. The mass flow associated with this cloud represents an infall per unit area of about the theoretically expected rate, and ~0.1-0.2 times the amount required for the whole Galaxy. },

With the aim of testing this hypothesis, we have made observations in the Halpha line of high-velocity clouds selected as the most likely candidates for being at larger than average distances. We have found Halpha emission from four out of five of the observed clouds, suggesting that the clouds under study are being illuminated by a Lyman continuum flux greater than that of the metagalactic ionizing radiation. Therefore, it appears likely that these clouds are in the Galactic halo and not distributed throughout the Local Group. },

In particular, we show that the canonical IMF can be recovered from very similar system mass functions, but with very different mass ratio distributions within those systems. This is a consequence of the basically log-normal shapes of all of the distributions. We also show that the relationships between the shapes of the core, system, and stellar mass functions may not be trivial. Therefore, different star formation in different regions could still result in the same IMF. },

	Abstract = {We analyse V- and H-band surface photometry of a sample of 18 Sb-Sd galaxies. Combining high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images with ground-based near-infrared observations, we extract photometric profiles, which cover the whole disc and provide the highest possible resolution. This is the first photometric study of late-type spirals for which the stellar kinematics have been measured. For 10 out of the 18 galaxies, HST data in both F160W (H) and F606W (V) are available, and, for those, we present colour maps and radial colour profiles at the resolution of the HST.<p/>  Colours vary significantly from galaxy to galaxy, but tend to be highly homogeneous within each galaxy, with smooth and flat colour profiles. Some of the colour maps show jumps in the inner regions, likely due to dust. We determine extinction maps in an almost model-independent way using the V - H colour map and the SAURON Mgb absorption line map of Ganda et al. The maps show that A<SUB>V</SUB> ranges from 0 to 2 mag, in the centre from 0 to 1.5 mag, in agreement with the models of Tuffs et al.<p/>  We describe the surface brightness profiles as the superposition of an exponential disc and a S&#233;rsic bulge. The bulges are small (0.1-2.5 kpc), and show a shape parameter n ranging from ~0.7 to 3, with a mean value smaller than two: well below the value for the classical de Vaucouleurs bulges. Most galaxies (16 out of 18) show a central light excess above the S&#233;rsic fit to the bulge, which can be interpreted as a nuclear cluster, as shown by previous studies. We provide zero-order estimates for the magnitude of these components. We discuss the correlations among the structural galaxy parameters and with other relevant quantities, such as Hubble type and stellar velocity dispersion. We compare these results with a recent paper by Graham &#38; Worley, who present a summary of most of the NIR surface photometry of spirals in the literature. For both early- and late-type spirals, bulge luminosity strongly correlates with central velocity dispersion; at constant velocity dispersion, later type bulges are larger and less dense, and have lower S&#233;rsic n-values. },

	Abstract = {The planetary nebula (PN) population of M33 is studied via multifiber spectroscopy with Hectospec at the MMT. In this paper, we present the spectra of 102 PNe, whereas plasma diagnostic and chemical abundances were performed on the 93 PNe where the necessary diagnostic lines were measured. About 20% of the PNe are compatible with being Type I; the rest of the sample is the progeny of an old disk stellar population, with main sequence masses M &lt; 3 M <SUB>sun</SUB> and ages t &gt; 0.3 Gyr. By studying the elemental abundances of the PNe in the M33 disk, we were able to infer that (1) there is a tight correlation between O/H and Ne/H, broadly excluding the evolution of oxygen; (2) the average abundances of the alpha-elements are consistent with those of H&#160;II regions, indicating a negligible global enrichment in the disk of M33 from the epoch of the formation of the PN progenitors to the present time; and (3) the radial oxygen gradient across the M33 disk has a slope of --0.031 &#177; 0.013 dex kpc<SUP>--1</SUP>, in agreement, within the errors, with the corresponding gradient derived from H&#160;II regions. Our observations do not seem to imply that the metallicity gradient across the M33 disk has flattened considerably with time. We report also the discovery of a PN with Wolf-Rayet features, PN039, belonging the class of late [WC] stars.<p/>  Observations reported here were obtained at the MMT Observatory, a joint facility of the Smithsonian Institution and the University of Arizona. },

	Abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of our ability to determine stellar masses, ages, reddening, and extinction values, and star formation rates (SFRs) of high-redshift galaxies by modeling broadband spectral energy distributions (SEDs) with stellar population synthesis. In order to do so, we computed synthetic optical-to-NIR SEDs for model galaxies taken from hydrodynamical merger simulations placed at redshifts 1.5 &lt;= z &lt;= 2.9. Viewed under different angles and during different evolutionary phases, the simulations represent a wide variety of galaxy types (disks, mergers, spheroids). We show that simulated galaxies span a wide range in SEDs and color, comparable to those of observed galaxies. In all star-forming phases, dust attenuation has a large effect on colors, SEDs, and fluxes. The broadband SEDs were then fed to a standard SED modeling procedure, and resulting stellar population parameters were compared to their true values. Disk galaxies generally show a decent median correspondence between the true and estimated mass and age, but suffer from large uncertainties (Deltalog M = --0.06<SUP>+0.06</SUP> <SUB>--0.13</SUB>, Deltalog age<SUB> w </SUB> = +0.03<SUP>+0.19</SUP> <SUB>--0.42</SUB>). During the merger itself, we find larger offsets: Deltalog M = --0.13<SUP>+0.10</SUP> <SUB>--0.14</SUB> and Deltalog age<SUB> w </SUB> = --0.12<SUP>+0.40</SUP> <SUB>--0.26</SUB>. E(B -- V) values are generally recovered well, but the estimated total visual absorption A<SUB>V</SUB> is consistently too low, increasingly so for larger optical depths (DeltaA<SUB>V</SUB> = --0.54<SUP>+0.40</SUP> <SUB>--0.46</SUB> in the merger regime). Since the largest optical depths occur during the phases of most intense star formation, it is for the highest SFRs that we find the largest underestimates (Deltalog SFR = --0.44<SUP>+0.32</SUP> <SUB>--0.31</SUB> in the merger regime). The masses, ages, E(B -- V), A<SUB>V</SUB> , and SFRs of merger remnants (spheroids) are very well reproduced. We discuss possible biases in SED modeling results caused by mismatch between the true and template star formation history (SFH), dust distribution, metallicity variations, and active galactic nucleus contribution. Mismatch between the real and template SFH, as is the case during the merging event, drives the age, and consequently mass estimate, down with respect to the true age and mass. However, the larger optical depth toward young stars during this phase reduces the effect considerably. Finally, we tested the photometric redshift code EAZY on the simulated galaxies placed at high redshift. We find a small scatter in Deltaz/(1 + z) of 0.031. },

	Abstract = {We have re-examined the most luminous X-ray sources in the starburst galaxy NGC&#160;4631, using XMM-Newton, Chandra, and ROSAT data. The most interesting source is a highly variable supersoft ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX). We suggest that its bolometric luminosity ~ a few 10<SUP>39</SUP> erg s<SUP>--1</SUP> in the high/supersoft state: this is an order of magnitude lower than estimated in previous studies, thus reducing the need for extreme or exotic scenarios. Moreover, we find that this source was in a noncanonical low/soft (kT ~ 0.1-0.3 keV) state during the Chandra observation. By comparing the high and low state, we argue that the spectral properties may not be consistent with the expected behavior of an accreting intermediate-mass black hole. We suggest that recurrent super-Eddington outbursts with photospheric expansion from a massive white dwarf (M <SUB>wd</SUB> gsim 1.3 M <SUB>sun</SUB>), powered by nonsteady nuclear burning, may be a viable possibility, in alternative to the previously proposed scenario of a super-Eddington outflow from an accreting stellar-mass black hole. The long-term average accretion rate required for nuclear burning to power such white-dwarf outbursts in this source and perhaps in other supersoft ULXs is &ap;(5-10) &#215; 10<SUP>--6</SUP> M <SUB>sun</SUB> yr<SUP>--1</SUP>: this is comparable to the thermal-timescale mass transfer rate invoked to explain the most luminous hard-spectrum ULXs (powered by black hole accretion). The other four most luminous X-ray sources in NGC&#160;4631 (three of which can be classified as ULXs) appear to be typical accreting black holes, in four different spectral states: high/soft, convex-spectrum, power-law with soft excess, and simple power-law. None of them require masses gsim50 M <SUB>sun</SUB>. },

	Abstract = {We present Gemini-North GMOS-IFU observations of the central starburst clumps and inner wind of M82, together with WIYN DensePak IFU observations of the inner 2 &#215; 0.9 kpc of the disk. These cover the emission lines of Halpha, [N II], [S II], and [S III] at a spectral resolution of 45-80 km s<SUP>--1</SUP>. The high signal-to-noise of the data is sufficient to accurately decompose the emission line profiles into multiple narrow components (FWHM ~ 30-130 km s<SUP>--1</SUP>) superimposed on a broad (FWHM ~ 150-350 km s<SUP>--1</SUP>) feature. This paper is the first of a series examining the optical structure of M82's disk and inner wind; here we focus on the ionized gaseous and stellar dynamics and present maps of the relevant emission line properties. Our observations show that ionized gas in the starburst core of M82 is dynamically complex with many overlapping expanding structures located at different radii. Localised line splitting of up to 100 km s<SUP>--1</SUP> in the narrow component is associated with expanding shells of compressed, cool, photoionized gas at the roots of the superwind outflow. We have been able to associate some of this inner-wind gas with a distinct outflow channel characterised by its dynamics and gas density patterns, and we discuss the consequences of this discovery in terms of the developing wind outflow. The broad optical emission line component is observed to become increasingly important moving outward along the outflow channel, and in general with increasing height above/below the plane. Following our recent work on the origins of this component, we associate it with turbulent gas in wind-clump interface layers and hence sites of mass loading, meaning that the turbulent mixing of cooler gas into the outflowing hot gas must become increasingly important with height, and provides powerful direct evidence for the existence of mass-loading over a large, spatially extended area reaching far into the inner wind. We discuss the consequences and implications of this. We confirm that the rotation axis of the ionized emission-line gas is offset from the stellar rotation axis and the photometric major axis by ~12&deg;, not only within the nuclear regions but over the whole inner 2 kpc of the disk. This attests to the perturbations introduced from M82's past interactions within the M81 group. Finally, finding a turn-over in the stellar and ionized gas rotation curves on both sides of the galaxy indicates that our sight line, in places, extends at least half way through disk, and conflicts with the high levels of obscuration usually associated with the nuclear regions of M82.<p/>  Based on observations with the Gemini and WIYN telescopes. },

	Abstract = {We develop observational tests of the idea that dissipation in gas-rich mergers produces the fundamental plane (FP) and related correlations obeyed by ellipticals. The FP ``tilt'' implies that lower mass ellipticals have a higher ratio of stellar to dark matter within their stellar effective radii. Models argue that mergers between more gas-rich (typically lower mass) disks yield larger mass fractions formed in compact starbursts, giving a smaller stellar R<SUB>e</SUB> and higher M<SUB>*</SUB>/M<SUB>tot</SUB> within that R<SUB>e</SUB>. Such starbursts leave a characteristic imprint in the surface brightness profile: a central excess above an outer profile established by the dissipationless violent relaxation of disk stars. In previous work, we developed empirical methods to decompose the observed profiles of ellipticals and robustly estimate the amount of dissipation in the original spheroid-forming merger(s). Applying this to a large sample of observed ellipticals, we test whether or not their location on the FP and its tilt are driven by dissipation. At fixed mass, ellipticals formed in more dissipational events are smaller and have higher M<SUB>*</SUB>/M<SUB>tot</SUB>. At fixed degree of dissipation, there is no tilt in the FP. We show that the dynamical mass estimator R<SUB>e</SUB>sigma<SUP>2</SUP>/G is a good estimator of the true mass: the observed FP tilt cannot primarily owe to other forms of nonhomology. Removing the effects of dissipation, observed ellipticals obey the same FP correlations as disks: unusual progenitors are not required to make typical ellipticals. Dissipation appears to be both necessary and sufficient to explain the FP tilt. },

	Abstract = {NGC 205, a close satellite of the M31 galaxy, is our nearest example of a dwarf elliptical galaxy. Photometric and kinematic observations suggest NGC 205 is undergoing tidal distortion from its interaction with M31. Despite earlier attempts, the orbit and progenitor properties of NGC 205 are not well known. We perform an optimized search for these unknowns by combining a genetic algorithm with restricted N-body simulations of the interaction. Coupled with photometric and kinematic observations as constraints, this allows for an effective exploration of the parameter space. We represent NGC 205 as a static Hernquist potential with embedded massless test particles serving as tracers of surface brightness. We explore three distinct, initially stable test particle configurations: cold rotating disk, warm rotating disk, and hot, pressure-supported spheroid. Each model reproduces some, but not all, of NGC 205's observed features, leading us to speculate that a rotating progenitor with substantial pressure support could match all of the observables. Furthermore, plausible combinations of mass and scale length for the spheroid progenitor model reproduce the observed velocity dispersion profile. For all three models, orbits best matching the observables place the satellite 11+/-9 kpc behind M31 moving at very large velocities: 300-500 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> on primarily radial orbits. Given that the observed radial component is only 54 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, this implies a large tangential motion for NGC 205, moving from northwest to southeast. This suggests NGC 205 is not associated with the observed stellar arc northeast of NGC 205. Furthermore, NGC 205's velocity appears near escape velocity, signifying NGC 205 is likely on its first M31 passage. },

	Abstract = {The stellar halo of M31 exhibits a startling level of inhomogeneity, in which the ``giant southern stream'' stands out most prominently. Our previous analysis indicates that this stream, as well as several other observed features, are products of the tidal disruption of a single satellite galaxy with stellar mass ~10<SUP>9</SUP> M<SUB>solar</SUB> less than 1 Gyr ago. Here we show that observed features of the stream and halo debris favor a cold, rotating, disklike progenitor over a dynamically hot, nonrotating one. These features include the asymmetric distribution of stars along the stream cross section and its metal-rich core/metal-poor sheath structure. We find that a disklike progenitor can also give rise to arclike features on the minor axis that resemble the recently discovered minor-axis ``streams,'' even reproducing their lower metallicity. Although interpreted initially as new, independent tidal streams, our analysis suggests that these minor-axis streams may arise from the progenitor of the giant stream. Overall, our study points the way to a more complete reconstruction of the stream progenitor and its merger with M31, based on the emerging picture that most of the major inhomogeneities observed in the M31 halo share a common origin with the giant stream. },

	Abstract = {We have used Suprime-Cam on the Subaru Telescope to conduct a V- and I-band imaging survey of fields sampling the spheroid of the Andromeda galaxy along its south-east minor axis. Our photometric data are deep enough to resolve stars down to the red clump. Based on a large and reliable sample of red giant stars available from this deep wide-field imager, we have derived metallicity distributions vs. radius and a surface brightness profile over projected distances of R=23-66 kpc from the galaxy's center. The metallicity distributions across this region shows a clear high mean metallicity and a broad distribution ([Fe/H] ~ -0.6 +/- 0.5), and indicates no metallicity gradient within our observed range. The surface brightness profile at R&gt;40 kpc is found to be flatter than previously thought. It is conceivable that this part of the halo samples as yet unidentified, metal-rich substructure. },

Most of them escaped detection in optical or shallow IR surveys in the eighties contributing to the puzzling missing number of AGB stars with respect to theoretical predictions and former stages of evolution. Observations and AGB models have advanced steadily in the following decades providing us with an almost complete view of the AGB stars in the Magellanic Clouds. Their properties are tracers of structure and chemistry across galaxies. New surveys will be able to fill-in the gaps, in terms of sensitivity and monitoring, providing new constraints for the formation and evolution of the Magellanic Clouds. },

	Abstract = {We present a morphological analysis of the feature-rich 2MASS LMC color-magnitude diagram, identifying Galactic and LMC populations and estimating the density of LMC populations alone. We also present the projected spatial distributions of various stellar populations. The conditions that prevailed when 2MASS observed the LMC provided 10 sigma limiting sensitivity for J&lt;~16.3, H&lt;~15.3, and K<SUB>s</SUB>&lt;~14.7. Major populations are identified based on matching morphological features of the color-magnitude diagram with expected positions of known populations, isochrone fits, and analysis of the projected spatial distributions. 2MASS has detected a significant population of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars (&gt;~10<SUP>4</SUP> sources) and obscured AGB stars (&gt;~2&#215;10<SUP>3</SUP> sources). The LMC populations along the first-ascent red giant branch (RGB) and AGB are quantified. Comparison of the giant luminosity functions in the bar and the outer regions of the LMC shows that both luminosity functions appear consistent with each other. The luminosity function in the central (bar) field has well-defined drop-off near K<SUB>s</SUB>=12.3 mag corresponding to the location of the RGB tip; the same feature is seen in the luminosity function of the entire LMC field. Isochrone fits for the corresponding giant branches reveal no significant differences in metallicities and ages between central and outer regions of the LMC. This may be evidence for strong dynamical evolution in the last several gigayears. In particular, the observed LMC giant branch is well fit by published tracks in the CIT/CTIO system with a distance modulus of mu=18.5+/-0.1, reddening E<SUB>B-V</SUB>=0.15-0.20, metallicity Z=0.004<SUP>+0.002</SUP><SUB>-0.001</SUB>, and age 3-13 Gyr. Analysis of deep 2MASS engineering data with 6 times the standard exposure produces similar estimates. },

	Abstract = {The stellar metallicity and its gradients pose constraints to the formation and evolution of galaxies. This is a study of the metallicity gradient of the LMC, SMC and M33 galaxies derived from their asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. The [Fe/H] abundance was derived from the ratio between C- and M-type AGB stars and its variation analysed as a function of galactocentric distance. Galaxy structure parameters were adopted from the literature. The metallicity of the LMC decreases linearly as -0.055+/-0.004 dex/kpc out to ~8 kpc from the centre. In the SMC [Fe/H] ~-1.12+/-0.03 dex up to ~12 kpc. The gradient of the M33 disc, until ~9 kpc, is -0.098+/-0.004 dex/kpc while an outer disc/halo, out to ~25 kpc, has [Fe/H] ~-1.61+/-0.03 dex. The metallicity of the LMC, as traced by different populations, bears the signature of two major star forming episodes: one forming a thick disc/halo population and one a thin disc and bar due to a close encounter with the MW and SMC. The [Fe/H] of the recent episode supports an LMC origin for the Stream. The metallicity of the SMC supports star formation, ~3 Gyr ago, as triggered by LMC interaction and sustained by the bar in the outer region of the galaxy. The SMC [Fe/H] agrees with the present-day abundance in the Bridge and shows no significant gradient. The metallicity of M33 supports an "inside-out" disc formation via accretion of metal poor gas from the interstellar medium. M33 has not experienced significant chemical enrichment from the formation of the AGB progenitors to the present time. },

We update distances, reddenings and metallicities with particular care to obtain coherent values for each galaxy. A new equation for the bolometric correction of M stars in terms of their (R-I) colours is obtained from Bessell et al. (1998) data. We present a critical discussion on the colour - spectral type relation for M stars which reveals a dramatic lack of reliable data for late M stars. Finally, we show that - when homogeneous data are used - the log(C/M0+) is well correlated to the [Fe/H] of the parent galaxy. },

	Abstract = {We investigate the effect of dry merging on the color-magnitude relation (CMR) of galaxies and find that the amount of merging predicted by a hierarchical model results in a red sequence that compares well with the observed low-redshift relation. A sample of ~ 29,000 early-type galaxies selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 6 shows that the bright end of the CMR has a shallower slope and smaller scatter than the faint end. This magnitude dependence is predicted by a simple toy model in which gas-rich mergers move galaxies onto a "creation red sequence" (CRS) by quenching their star formation, and subsequent mergers between red, gas-poor galaxies (so-called "dry" mergers) move galaxies along the relation. We use galaxy merger trees from a semianalytic model of galaxy formation to test the amplitude of this effect and find a change in slope at the bright end that brackets the observations, using gas fraction thresholds of 10%-30% to separate wet and dry mergers. A more realistic model that includes scatter in the CRS shows that dry merging decreases the scatter at the bright end. Contrary to previous claims, the small scatter in the observed CMR thus cannot be used to constrain the amount of dry merging. },

@article{Allanson:2009,
	Abstract = {This paper addresses the challenge of understanding the typical star formation histories of red sequence galaxies, using linestrength indices and mass-to-light ratios as complementary constraints on their stellar age distribution. We construct simple parametric models of the star formation history that bracket a range of scenarios, and fit these models to the linestrength indices of low-redshift cluster red-sequence galaxies. For giant galaxies, we confirm the downsizing trend. We find, however, that this trend flattens or reverses at sigma &lt; 70 km/s. We then compare predicted stellar mass-to-light ratios with dynamical mass-to-light ratios derived from the Fundamental Plane (FP), or by the SAURON group. For galaxies with sigma ~ 70 km/s, models with a "frosting" of young stars and models with exponential star formation histories have stellar mass-to-light ratios that are larger than observed dynamical mass-to-light ratios by factors of 1.7 and 1.4, respectively, and so are rejected. The SSP model is consistent with the FP, and requires a modest amount of dark matter (20-30%) to account for the difference between stellar and dynamical mass-to-light ratios. A model in which star formation was "quenched" at intermediate ages is also consistent with the observations. We find that the contribution of stellar populations to the "tilt" of the FP is highly dependent on the assumed star-formation history: for the SSP model, the tilt of the FP is driven primarily by stellar-population effects. For a quenched model, two-thirds of the tilt is due to stellar populations and only one third is due to dark matter or non-homology. },

@article{Conroy:2009,
	Abstract = {The stellar masses, mean ages, metallicities, and star formation histories of galaxies are now commonly estimated via stellar population synthesis (SPS) techniques. SPS relies on stellar evolution calculations from the main sequence to stellar death, stellar spectral libraries, phenomenological dust models, and stellar initial mass functions (IMFs) to translate the evolution of a multimetallicity, multi-age set of stars into a prediction for the time-evolution of the integrated light from that set of stars. Each of these necessary inputs carries significant uncertainties that have until now received little systematic attention. The present work is the first in a series that explores the impact of uncertainties in key phases of stellar evolution and the IMF on the derived physical properties of galaxies and the expected luminosity evolution for a passively evolving set of stars. A Monte Carlo Markov Chain approach is taken to fit near-UV through near-IR photometry of a representative sample of low- and high-redshift galaxies with this new SPS model. Significant results include the following. (1) Including uncertainties in stellar evolution, stellar masses at z ~ 0 carry errors of ~0.3 dex at 95% CL with little dependence on luminosity or color, while at z ~ 2, the masses of bright red galaxies are uncertain at the ~0.6 dex level. (2) Either current stellar evolution models, current observational stellar libraries, or both, do not adequately characterize the metallicity-dependence of the thermally pulsating AGB phase. (3) Conservative estimates on the uncertainty of the slope of the IMF in the solar neighborhood imply that luminosity evolution per unit redshift is uncertain at the ~0.4 mag level in the K band, which is a substantial source of uncertainty for interpreting the evolution of galaxy populations across time. Any possible evolution in the IMF, as suggested by several independent lines of evidence, will only exacerbate this problem. (4) Assuming a distribution of stellar metallicities within a galaxy, rather than a fixed value as is usually assumed, can yield important differences when considering bands blueward of V, but is not a concern for redder bands. Spectroscopic information may alleviate some of these concerns, though uncertainties in the stellar spectral libraries and the importance of nonsolar abundance ratios have not yet been systematically investigated in the SPS context. },

@article{Fitzpatrick:2009,
	Abstract = {We combine new observations from the Hubble Space Telescope's Advanced Camera of Survey with existing data to investigate the wavelength dependence of near-IR (NIR) extinction. Previous studies suggest a power law form for NIR extinction, with a "universal" value of the exponent, although some recent observations indicate that significant sight line-to-sight line variability may exist. We show that a power-law model for the NIR extinction provides an excellent fit to most extinction curves, but that the value of the power, beta, varies significantly from sight line to sight line. Therefore, it seems that a "universal NIR extinction law" is not possible. Instead, we find that as beta decreases, R(V) &equiv; A(V)/E(B -- V) tends to increase, suggesting that NIR extinction curves which have been considered "peculiar" may, in fact, be typical for different R(V) values. We show that the power-law parameters can depend on the wavelength interval used to derive them, with the beta increasing as longer wavelengths are included. This result implies that extrapolating power-law fits to determine R(V) is unreliable. To avoid this problem, we adopt a different functional form for NIR extinction. This new form mimics a power law whose exponent increases with wavelength, has only two free parameters, can fit all of our curves over a longer wavelength baseline and to higher precision, and produces R(V) values which are consistent with independent estimates and commonly used methods for estimating R(V). Furthermore, unlike the power-law model, it gives R(V)s that are independent of the wavelength interval used to derive them. It also suggests that the relation R(V) = -1.36 \frac{E(K-V)}{E(B-V)} - 0.79 can estimate R(V) to &#177;0.12. Finally, we use model extinction curves to show that our extinction curves are in accord with theoretical expectations, and demonstrate how large samples of observational quantities can provide useful constraints on the grain properties. },

Moreover, empirical calibrators and evolutionary predictions suggest the presence of a spread in heavy element abundance of the order of one-half dex. The comparison between old and intermediate-age core He-burning models with a well defined overdensity in the color-magnitude diagram indicates the presence of both intermediate-age, red clump stars and of old, red horizontal branch stars.<p/>  Based on observations collected with the ACS and the WFPC2 onboard the HST. },

	Abstract = {We present a detrending algorithm for the removal of trends in time series. Trends in time series could be caused by various systematic and random noise sources such as cloud passages, changes of airmass, telescope vibration, CCD noise or defects of photometry. Those trends undermine the intrinsic signals of stars and should be removed. We determine the trends from subsets of stars that are highly correlated among themselves. These subsets are selected based on a hierarchical tree clustering algorithm. A bottom-up merging algorithm based on the departure from normal distribution in the correlation is developed to identify subsets, which we call clusters. After identification of clusters, we determine a trend per cluster by weighted sum of normalized light curves. We then use quadratic programming to detrend all individual light curves based on these determined trends. Experimental results with synthetic light curves containing artificial trends and events are presented. Results from other detrending methods are also compared. The developed algorithm can be applied to time series for trend removal in both narrow and wide field astronomy. },

	Abstract = {We present imaging of the recently discovered Hercules Milky Way satellite and its surrounding regions to study its structure, star formation history and to thoroughly search for signs of disruption. We robustly determine the distance, luminosity, size and morphology of Hercules utilizing a bootstrap approach to characterize our uncertainties. We derive a distance to Hercules of $133 \pm 6$ kpc via a comparison to empirical and theoretical isochrones. As previous studies have found, Hercules is very elongated, with $\epsilon=0.67\pm0.03$ and a half light radius of $r_{h} \simeq 230$ pc. Using the color magnitude fitting package StarFISH, we determine that Hercules is old ($&gt;12$ Gyr) and metal poor ($[Fe/H]\sim-2.0$), with a spread in metallicity, in agreement with previous spectroscopic work. We infer a total absolute magnitude of $M_V=-5.3\pm0.4$. Our innovative search for external Hercules structure both in the plane of the sky and along the line of sight yields some evidence that Hercules is embedded in a larger stream of stars. A clear stellar extension is seen to the Northwest with several additional candidate stellar overdensities along the position angle of Hercules out to $\sim$35' ($\sim$1.3 kpc). While the association of any of the individual stellar overdensities with Hercules is difficult to determine, we do show that the summed color magnitude diagram of all three is consistent with Hercules' stellar population. Finally, we estimate that any change in the distance to Hercules across its face is at most $\sim$6 kpc; and the data are consistent with Hercules being at the same distance throughout. },

	Abstract = {We have tested the application to Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data of the software package MATCH, which fits color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) to estimate stellar population parameters and distances. These tests on a set of six globular clusters show that these techniques recover their known properties. New ways of using the CMD-fitting software enable us to deal with an extended distribution of stars along the line-of-sight, to constrain the overall properties of sparsely populated objects, and to detect the presence of stellar overdensities in wide-area surveys. We then also apply MATCH to CMDs for 12 recently discovered Milky Way satellites to derive in a uniform fashion their distances, ages, and metallicities. While the majority of them appear consistent with a single stellar population, CVn I, UMa II, and Leo T exhibit (from SDSS data alone) a more complex history with multiple epochs of star formation. },

@article{Franceschini:2009,
	Abstract = {[abridged] At the end of the Spitzer cryogenic mission and the onset of the Herschel era, we review our current knowledge on galaxy evolution at IR wavelengths. We also develop new tools for the analysis of background fluctuations to constrain source counts in regimes of high confusion. We analyse a large variety of new data on galaxy evolution and high-z source populations from Spitzer surveys, as well as complementary data from sub-mm (BLAST) and millimetric ground-based observations. These data confirm earlier indications about a very rapid increase of galaxy volume emissivity up to z~1. This is the fastest evolution rate observed for galaxies at any wavelengths. The observed Spitzer counts at 24 micron require a combination of fast evolution for the dominant population and a bumpy spectrum with substantial PAH emission at z~1 to 2. Confusion-limited number counts at longer wavelengths confirm these results. All the present data require that the fast observed evolution from z=0 to 1 flattens around redshift 1 and then keeps approximately constant up to z~2.5 at least. The present-day IR data provide clear evidence for the existence of a distinct population of very luminous galaxies becoming dominant at z &gt; 1. Their cosmological evolution, peaking around z~2, shows a faster decay with cosmic time than lower luminosity systems, whose maximal activity is set around z~1, then supporting an earlier phase of formation for the most luminous and massive galaxies. From a comparison of our results on the comoving IR emissivity with recent estimates of the redshift-dependent stellar mass functions of galaxies, we infer that a large fraction (&gt;=50%) of the IR activity at z &gt; 1 should be due to obscured AGN accretion and that concomitant SF in high-z luminous sources should follow a top-heavy IMF. },

	Abstract = {We investigate the atomic ($HI$) and molecular ($H_{2}$) Hydrogen content of normal galaxies by combining observational studies linking galaxy stellar and gas budgets to their host dark matter (DM) properties, with a physically grounded galaxy formation model. This enables us to analyse empirical relationships between the virial, stellar, and gaseous masses of galaxies and explore their physical origins. Utilising a semi-analytic model (SAM) to study the evolution of baryonic material within evolving DM halos, we study the effects of baryonic infall, star formation and various feedback mechanisms on the properties of formed galaxies using the most up-to-date physical recipes. We find that in order to significantly improve agreement with observations of low-mass galaxies we must suppress the infall of baryonic material and exploit a two-phase interstellar medium (ISM), where the ratio of $HI$ to $H_{2}$ is determined by the galactic disk structure. Modifying the standard Schmidt-Kennicutt star formation law by correlating the star formation activity with the $H_{2}$ gas mass allows us to simultaneously reproduce stellar, $HI$ and $H_{2}$ mass functions for normal galaxies. },

	Abstract = {We present an analysis of Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) calibration photometry of the old open cluster M67 (NGC 2682). The proper-motion-cleaned color-magnitude diagram (CMD) resulting from these data extends ~3 mag deeper than one based on data from the point source catalog. The CMD extends from above the helium-burning red clump to a faint limit that is more than 7 mag below the main-sequence (MS) turnoff (TO) in the K<SUB>S</SUB> band. After adopting a reddening of E(B -- V) = 0.041 &#177; 0.004 and a metal abundance of [Fe/H] = --0.009 &#177; 0.009 based on a survey of published values, we fit the unevolved MS of M67 to field MS stars with 2MASS photometry and Hipparcos parallaxes. This analysis yields distance moduli of (m-M)_{K_S} = 9.72 &#177; 0.05 and (m -- M)<SUB>0</SUB> = 9.70 &#177; 0.05, which are consistent with published values. We compare the theoretical isochrones of Girardi et&#160;al. and Dotter et&#160;al. to the CMD of M67 and comment on the relative merits of each set of models. These comparisons suggest an age between 3.5 and 4.0 Gyr for M67. The depth of the M67 data makes them ideal for the calibration of a new age indicator that has recently been devised by Calamida et&#160;al.---the difference in (J -- K<SUB>S</SUB> ) color between the MS TO and the point on the lower MS where it turns down (TD) and becomes nearly vertical [Delta(J -- K<SUB>S</SUB> )<SUP>TO</SUP> <SUB>TD</SUB>]. Coupled with deep 2MASS photometry for three other open clusters, NGC 2516, M44, and NGC 6791, we calibrate Delta(J -- K<SUB>S</SUB> ) in terms of age and find Delta(J -- K<SUB>S</SUB> )<SUP>TO</SUP> <SUB>TD</SUB> = (3.017 &#177; 0.347) - (0.259 &#177; 0.037)&#215;log age (yr).<p/>  This paper is WIYN Open Cluster Study XL in the series. },

	Abstract = {Ongoing star formation in the Milky Way requires continuous gaseous fuel from accretion. Previous work has suggested that the accretion of dwarf galaxies could provide the needed gas for this process. In this work, we investigate whether dwarf galaxy accretion is consistent with the radial profile of star formation observed in the Milky Way, which is strongly concentrated toward the center of the gaseous disk of the Galaxy. Using realistic parameters for the Galactic potential, gaseous halo, Galactic disk, velocities of dwarf galaxies, and effects of drag on stripped gas in the halo, we model the distribution of radii at which dwarf galaxies accrete onto the Galactic disk. We also model the radial distribution of the accretion of gas that cools directly out of the halo by examining the results of recent simulations. We show that dwarf galaxies cannot reproduce the concentration of accretion toward the center of the Galaxy required by star formation. We also show that clouds that cool directly from the halo can reproduce this central concentration, and conclude that this difference is largely due to the discrepancy in absolute specific angular momentum between the two mechanisms. },

	Abstract = {The formation of dust in the outflows of low- and intermediate-mass stars on the first giant branch and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) is studied and the relative contributions of stars of different initial masses and metallicities to the interstellar medium (ISM) at the instant of solar system formation are derived. These predictions are compared with the characteristics of the parent stars of presolar dust grains found in primitive meteorites and interplanetary dust particles (IDPs) inferred from their isotopic compositions. For this purpose, model calculations for dust condensation in stellar outflows are combined with synthetic models of stellar evolution on the first giant branch and AGB and an evolution model of the Milky Way for the solar neighborhood. The dust components considered are olivine, pyroxene, carbon, SiC, and iron. The corresponding dust production rates are derived for the solar vicinity. From these rates and taking into account dust destruction by supernova shocks in the ISM, the contributions to the inventory of presolar dust grains in the solar system are derived for stars of different initial masses and metallicities. It is shown that stars on the first giant branch and the early AGB are not expected to form dust, in accord with astronomical observations. Dust formation is concentrated in the last phase of evolution, the thermally pulsing AGB. Due to the limited lifetime of dust grains in the ISM only parent stars from a narrow range of metallicities are expected to contribute to the population of presolar dust grains. Silicate and silicon carbide dust grains are predicted to come from parent stars with metallicities not less than about Z &ap; 0.008 (0.6&#160;&#215;&#160;solar). This metallicity limit is higher than that inferred from presolar SiC grain isotope data. The population of presolar carbon dust grains is predicted to originate from a wider range of metallicities, down to Z &ap; 0.004. Masses of AGB stars that produce C-rich dust are in the range &ap;1.5-4 M <SUB>sun</SUB>, in good agreement with what was inferred from the isotope data of presolar grains. The mass distribution of AGB stars that produce O-rich dust is essentially bimodal, with roughly equal contributions from stars in the ranges 1.3-2.5 M <SUB>sun</SUB> and &ap;4-8 M <SUB>sun</SUB>. These model predictions are in conflict with the O-isotope data of presolar grains that indicate contributions essentially only from 1 to 2.5 M <SUB>sun</SUB> AGB stars. },

	Abstract = {We compare the distribution of diffuse intracluster light detected in the Virgo Cluster via broadband imaging with that inferred from searches for intracluster planetary nebulae (IPNe). We find a rough correspondence on large scales (~ 100 kpc) between the two, but with very large scatter (~ 1.3 mag/arcsec^2). On smaller scales (1 -- 10 kpc), the presence or absence of correlation is clearly dependent on the underlying surface brightness. On these scales, we find a correlation in regions of higher surface brightness (mu_V &lt; ~27) which are dominated by the halos of large galaxies such as M87, M86, and M84. In those cases, we are likely tracing PNe associated with galaxies rather than true IPNe. In true intracluster fields, at lower surface brightness, the correlation between luminosity and IPN candidates is much weaker. While a correlation between broadband light and IPNe is expected based on stellar populations, a variety of statistical, physical, and methodological effects can act to wash out this correlation and explain the lack of a strong correlation at lower surface brightness found here.

	Abstract = {We study the chemical evolution of the disks of the Milky Way (MW) and of Andromeda (M31), in order to reveal common points and differences between the two major galaxies of the Local group. We use a large set of observational data for M31, including recent observations of the Star Formation Rate (SFR) and gas profiles, as well as stellar metallicity distributions along its disk. We show that, when expressed in terms of the corresponding disk scale lengths, the observed radial profiles of MW and M31 exhibit interesting similarities, suggesting the possibility of a description within a common framework. We find that the profiles of stars, gas fraction and metallicity of the two galaxies, as well as most of their global properties, are well described by our model, provided the star formation efficiency in M31 disk is twice as large as in the MW. We show that the star formation rate profile of M31 cannot be fitted with any form of the Kennicutt-Schmidt law (KS Law) for star formation. We attribute those discrepancies to the fact that M31 has undergone a more active star formation history, even in the recent past, as suggested by observations of a "head-on" collision with the neighboring M32 galaxy about 200 Myr ago. The MW has most probably undergone a quiescent secular evolution, making possible a fairly successful description with a simple model. If M31 is more typical of spiral galaxies, as recently suggested by Hammer et al. (2007), more complex models, involving galaxy interactions, will be required for the description of spirals. },

	Abstract = {We present a comprehensive study of star-forming (SF) regions in the nearest large spiral galaxy M31. We use GALEX far-UV (1344-1786 \AA, FUV) and near-UV (1771-2831 \AA, NUV) imaging to detect young massive stars and trace the recent star formation across the galaxy. The FUV and NUV flux measurements of the SF regions, combined with ground-based data for estimating the reddening by interstellar dust from the massive stars they contain, are used to derive their ages and masses. The GALEX imaging, combining deep sensitivity and entire coverage of the galaxy, provides a complete picture of the recent star formation in M31 and its variation with environment throughout the galaxy. The FUV and NUV measurements are sensitive to detect stellar populations younger than a few hundred Myrs. We detected 894 SF regions, with size &gt; 1600 pc^{2} above an average FUV flux limit of ~ 26 ABmag arcsecond^{-2}, over the whole 26 kpc galaxy disk. We derive the star-formation history of M31 within this time span. The star formation rate (SFR) from the youngest UV sources (age &lt; 10 Myr) is comparable to that derived from H_{alpha}, as expected. We show the dependence of the results on the assumed metallicity. When star formation detected from IR measurements of the heated dust is added to the UV-measured star formation (from the unobscured populations) in the recent few Myrs, we find the SFR has slightly decreased in recent epochs, with a possible peak between 10 and 100 Myrs, and an average value of SFR ~ 0.6 or 0.7 M_{sun} yr^{-1} (for metallicity Z=0.02 or 0.05 respectively) over the last 400 Myrs. },

	Abstract = {We present differential stellar population models, which allow improved determinations of the ages, iron and alpha-element abundances of old stellar populations from spectral fitting. These new models are calibrated at solar abundances using the predictions from classical, semi-empirical stellar population models. We then use the predictive power of fully synthetic models to compute predictions for different [Fe/H] and [alpha/Fe]. We show that these new differential models provide remarkably accurate fits to the integrated optical spectra of the bulge globular clusters NGC6528 and NGC6553, and that the inferred [Fe/H] and [alpha/Fe] agree with values derived elsewhere from stellar photometry and spectroscopy. The analysis of a small sample of SDSS early-type galaxies further confirms that our alpha-enhanced models provide a better fit to the spectra of massive ellipticals than the solar-scaled ones. Our approach opens new opportunities for precision measurements of abundance ratios in galaxies. },

@article{Monaco:2009,
	Abstract = {Context. NGC 205 is a peculiar dwarf elliptical galaxy hosting in its center a population of young blue stars. Their origin is still matter of debate, the central fresh star formation activity possibly being related to dynamical interactions between NGC 205 and M31. Aims. The star formation history in the central 30\arcsec ($\sim$120 pc) around the NGC 205 central nucleus is investigated in order to obtain clues to the origin of the young stellar population. Methods. Deep HST/ACS CCD photometry is compared with theoretical isochrones and luminosity functions to characterize the stellar content of the region under study and compute the recent SF rate. Results. Our photometry reveals a previously undetected blue plume of young stars clearly distinguishable down to I$\simeq$26. Our analysis suggests that 1.9$\times10^5$ M$_\odot$ were produced between approximately 62 Myr and 335 Myr ago in the NGC 205 inner regions, with a latest minor episode occurring $\sim$25 Myr ago. This implies a star formation rate of $\sim7\times10^{-4}$ M$_\odot$/yr over this period. Conclusions. The excellent fit of the observed luminosity function of young main sequence stars obtained with a model having a constant star formation rate argues against a tidally triggered star formation activity over the last $\sim$300 Myr. Rather, a constant SF may be consistent with NGC 205 being on its first interaction with M 31. },

	Abstract = {We report on the properties of 89 low-mass star clusters located in the vicinity of luminous young clusters ("blue globulars") in the disk of M31. Eighty-two of the clusters are newly detected. We have determined their integrated magnitudes and colors, based on a series of Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 exposures in blue and red (HST filters F450W and F814W). The integrated apparent magnitudes range from F450W = 17.5 to 22.5, and the colors indicate a wide range of ages. Stellar color-magnitude diagrams for all clusters were obtained and those with bright enough stars were fit to theoretical isochrones to provide age estimates. The ages range from 12 Myr to &gt;500 Myr. Reddenings, which average E(F450 -- F814) = 0.59 with a dispersion of 0.21 mag, were derived from the main-sequence fitting for those clusters. Comparison of these ages and integrated colors with single population theoretical models with solar abundances suggests a color offset of 0.085 mag at the ages tested. Estimated ages for the remaining clusters are based on their measured colors. The age-frequency diagram shows a steep decline of number with age, with a large decrease in number per age interval between the youngest and the oldest clusters detected. },

Here we identify a sample of red supergiants in M31 (the most metal-rich of the Local Group galaxies) and derive their physical properties by fitting MARCS atmosphere models to moderate resolution optical spectroscopy, and from V-K photometry. },

	Abstract = {We present Hubble Space Telescope observations taken with the Advanced Camera for Surveys Wide Field Channel of two fields near M32---between 4 and 6 kpc from the center of M31. The data cover a time baseline sufficient for the identification and characterization of 681 RR Lyrae variables of which 555 are ab-type and 126 are c-type. The mean magnitude of these stars is langVrang = 25.29 &#177; 0.05, where the uncertainty combines both the random and systematic errors. The location of the stars in the Bailey diagram and the ratio of c-type RR Lyraes to all types are both closer to RR Lyraes in Oosterhoff type I globular clusters in the Milky Way as compared with Oosterhoff II clusters. The mean periods of the ab-type and c-type RR Lyraes are langP <SUB>ab</SUB>rang = 0.557 &#177; 0.003 and langP <SUB>c</SUB>rang = 0.327 &#177; 0.003, respectively, where the uncertainties in each case represent the standard error of the mean. When the periods and amplitudes of the ab-type RR Lyraes in our sample are interpreted in terms of metallicity, we find the metallicity distribution function to be indistinguishable from a Gaussian with a peak at lang[Fe/H]rang = --1.50 &#177; 0.02, where the quoted uncertainty is the standard error of the mean. Using a relation between RR Lyrae luminosity and metallicity along with a reddening of E(B -- V) = 0.08 &#177; 0.03, we find a distance modulus of (m -- M)<SUB>0</SUB> = 24.46 &#177; 0.11 for M31. We examine the radial metallicity gradient in the environs of M31 using published values for the bulge and halo of M31 as well as the abundances of its dwarf spheroidal companions and globular clusters. In this context, we conclude that the RR Lyraes in our two fields are more likely to be halo objects rather than associated with the bulge or disk of M31, in spite of the fact that they are located at 4-6 kpc in projected distance from the center.<p/>  Based on observations taken with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Telescope. },

	Abstract = {We present a wide field census of resolved stellar populations in the northern half of M81, conducted with Suprime-Cam on the 8-m Subaru telescope and covering an area ~ 0.3 square degrees. The resulting color-magnitude diagram reaches over one magnitude below the red giant branch (RGB) tip, allowing a detailed comparison between the young and old stellar spatial distributions. The surface density of stars with ages &lt;~ 100 Myr is correlated with that of neutral hydrogen in a manner similar to the disk-averaged Kennicutt-Schmidt relation. We trace this correlation down to gas densities of ~ 2 x 10^20 cm^{-2}, lower than typically probed with H-alpha flux. Both diffuse light and resolved RGB star counts show compelling evidence for a faint, extended structural component beyond the bright optical disk, with a much flatter surface brightness profile. The star counts allow us to probe this component to significantly fainter levels than is possible with the diffuse light alone. From the colors of its RGB stars, we estimate this component has a peak global metallicity [M/H] ~ -1.1 +/- 0.3 at deprojected radii 32 - 44 kpc assuming an age of 10 Gyr and distance of 3.6 Mpc. The spatial distribution of its RGB stars follows a power-law surface density profile, I(r) ~ r^{-gamma}, with gamma ~ 2. [Abridged] },

@article{de-Jong:2008a,
	Abstract = {Measuring the integrated stellar halo light around galaxies is very challenging. The surface brightness of these haloes is expected to be many magnitudes below dark sky and the central brightness of the galaxy. Here, I show that in some of the recent literature the effect of very extended Point Spread Function (PSF) tails on the measurements of halo light has been underestimated; especially in the case of edge-on disc galaxies. The detection of a halo along the minor axis of an edge-on galaxy in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field can largely be explained by scattered galaxy light. Similarly, depending on filter and the shape one assumes for the uncertain extended PSF, 20-80 per cent of the halo light found along the minor axis of scaled and stacked Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) edge-on galaxy images can be explained by scattered galaxy light. Scattered light also significantly contributes to the anomalous halo colours of stacked SDSS images. The scattered light fraction decreases when looking in the quadrants away from the minor axis. The remaining excess light is well modelled with a S&#233;rsic profile halo with shape parameters based on star count halo detections of nearby galaxies. Even though, the contribution from PSF scattered light does not fully remove the need for extended components around these edge-on galaxies, it will be very challenging to make accurate halo light shape and colour measurements from integrated light without very careful PSF measurements and scattered light modelling. },

	Abstract = {The quality of modern astronomical data and the agility of current image-processing software enable the visualization of data in a way that exceeds the traditional definition of an astronomical image. Two developments in particular have led to a fundamental change in how astronomical images can be assembled. First, the availability of high-quality multiwavelength and narrowband data allow for images that do not correspond to the wavelength sensitivity of the human eye, thereby introducing ambiguity in the usage and interpretation of color. Second, many image-processing software packages now use a layering metaphor that allows for any number of astronomical data sets to be combined into a color image. With this technique, images with as many as eight data sets have been produced. Each data set is intensity-scaled and colorized independently, creating an immense parameter space that can be used to assemble the image. Since such images are intended for data visualization, scaling and color schemes must be chosen that best illustrate the science. A practical guide is presented on how to use the layering metaphor to generate publication-ready astronomical images from as many data sets as desired. A methodology is also given on how to use intensity scaling, color, and composition to create contrasts in an image that highlight the scientific detail. Examples of image creation are discussed. },

	Abstract = {In recent years, there has been a proliferation of wide-field sky surveys to search for a variety of transient objects. Using relatively short focal lengths, the optics of these systems produce undersampled stellar images often marred by a variety of aberrations. As participants in such activities, we have developed a new algorithm for image subtraction that no longer requires high-quality reference images for comparison. The computational efficiency is comparable with similar procedures currently in use. The general technique is cross-convolution: two convolution kernels are generated to make a test image and a reference image separately transform to match as closely as possible. In analogy to the optimization technique for generating smoothing splines, the inclusion of an rms width penalty term constrains the diffusion of stellar images. In addition, by evaluating the convolution kernels on uniformly spaced subimages across the total area, these routines can accommodate point-spread functions that vary considerably across the focal plane. },

	Abstract = {We describe the TFIT software package to measure galaxy photometry using prior information from high-resolution observations. Our basic methodology is similar in principle but different in detail from previous procedures for crowded field photometry. We use the spatial positions and morphologies of objects in an image with higher angular resolution to construct object templates, which are then fitted to a lower resolution image, solving for the object fluxes as free parameters. Using extensive experiments on both simulated and real data, we show that this template-fitting method measures accurate object photometry to the limiting sensitivity of the image. In this limit, our method derives robust flux upper limits for objects fainter than the limiting image surface brightness. We describe the challenges encountered in applying this technique to real data, and methods to cope with some of them. },

	Abstract = {We have carried out a survey of compact star clusters (apparent size &lt;3 arcsec) in the southwest part of the M31 galaxy, based on the high-resolution Suprime-Cam images (17.5 arcmin x 28.5 arcmin), covering ~15% of the deprojected galaxy disk area. The UBVRI photometry of 285 cluster candidates (V &lt; 20.5 mag) was performed using frames of the Local Group Galaxies Survey. The final sample, containing 238 high probability star cluster candidates (typical half-light radius r_h ~ 1.5 pc), was selected by specifying a lower limit of r_h &gt; 0.15 arcsec (&gt;0.6 pc). We derived cluster parameters based on the photometric data and multiband images by employing simple stellar population models. The clusters have a wide range of ages from ~5 Myr (young objects associated with 24 um and/or Ha emission) to ~10 Gyr (globular cluster candidates), and possess mass in a range of 3.0 &lt; log(m/M_sol) &lt; 4.3 peaking at m ~ 4000 M_sol. Typical age of these intermediate-mass clusters is in the range of 30 Myr &lt; t &lt; 3 Gyr, with a prominent peak at ~70 Myr. These findings suggest a rich intermediate-mass star cluster population in M31, which appears to be scarce in the Milky Way galaxy. },

	Abstract = {The disruption of the M33 galaxy is evident from its extended gaseous structure. We present new data from the Galactic Arecibo L-Band Feed Array H I (GALFA-H I) Survey that show the full extent and detailed spatial and kinematic structure of M33's neutral hydrogen. Over 18% of the H I mass of M33 (M_HI_{tot}=1.4 \times 10^9 M <SUB>sun</SUB>) is found beyond the star-forming disk as traced in the far-ultraviolet (FUV). The most distinct features are extended warps, an arc from the northern warp to the disk, diffuse gas surrounding the galaxy, and a southern cloud with a filament back to the galaxy. The features extend out to 22&#160;kpc from the galaxy center (18&#160;kpc from the edge of the FUV disk), and the gas is directly connected to M33's disk. Only five discrete clouds (i.e., gas not directly connected to M33 in position-velocity space) are cataloged in the vicinity of M33, and these clouds show similar properties to Galactic and M31 halo clouds. M33's gaseous features most likely originate from the tidal disruption of M33 by M31 1-3&#160;Gyr ago as shown by an orbit analysis which results in a tidal radius &lt;15&#160;kpc in the majority of M33's possible orbits. M33 is now beyond the disruptive gravitational influence of M31, and the gas appears to be returning to M33's disk and redistributing its star formation fuel. M33's high mean velocity dispersion in the disk (~18.5&#160;km&#160;s<SUP>--1</SUP>) may also be consistent with the previous interaction and high rate of star formation. M33 will either exhaust its star formation fuel in the next few Gyrs or eventually become star formation fuel for M31. The latter represents the accretion of a large gaseous satellite by a spiral galaxy, similar to the Magellanic Clouds' relationship to the Galaxy. },

	Abstract = {A survey for compact clusters with a dimension of 10pc order was conducted in an area of about 500 square arc-minutes of the south-west part of the M31 disk, making use of the high-resolution capability of Suprime-Cam. Photometry in the B, V, and R broad-bands, and in the R<SUP>*</SUP> medium-band centered around Halpha with varying apertures was carried out for about 1200 targets, which are related to about 300 compact objects detected in the survey. The results for 101 prominent compact objects are presented as photometric catalogues and morphological atlases, separately for samples with and without strong Halpha emission. Many of the compact objects, which were previously suspected to be globular cluster candidates, are judged to be open clusters based upon their internal structures of sub-arc-second order. The majority of the 49 listed compact non-emission objects, which are restricted to be brighter than M<SUB>V</SUB> &tilde; -5, have colors of 0 &lt; B - V &lt; 1.0, indicating their nature of massive evolved clusters. In contrast, only about 10% of the 52 listed compact emission objects are brighter than Mi<SUB>V</SUB> &tilde; -5, probably reflecting the short period of the emission phase and the substantial effects of the circum-stellar extinction. The detection of a few candidates of background galaxies is also reported. },

	Abstract = {Context. Spitzer Space Telescope observations and dust emission models are used to discuss the distribution of dust and its characteristics in M31. Together with GALEX FUV, NUV, and SDSS images we studied the age dependence of the dust heating process. Methods.Spitzer IRAC/MIPS maps of M31 were matched together and compared to dust emission models allowing to constrain the dust mass, the intensity of the mean radiation field, the abundance of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH) particles. The total infrared emission (TIR) was analyzed in function of UV and Optical colors and compared to predictions of models which consider the age-dependent dust heating. Results. We demonstrate that cold-dust component emission dominates the infrared spectral energy distribution of M31. The mean intensity of the radiation field heating the dust is low (typically U&lt;2, where U=1 is the value in the solar surrounding). Due to the lack of submillimetric measurements the dust mass (M_{dust}) is only weakly constrained by the infrared spectrum. We show that across the spiral-ring structure of M31 a fraction &gt;3% of the total dust mass is in PAHs. UV and optical colors are correlated to (TIR/FUV) ratios in \sim 670 pc-sized regions overall the disk of M31, although deviating from the IRX-beta relationship for starburst galaxies. We derived that in 83% of the regions analyzed across the 10kpc ring more than 50% of the energy absorbed by the dust is rediated at \lambda &gt; 4000 \AA and that dust in M31 appears mainly heated by populations a few Gyr old even across the star-forming ring. The attenuation is varying radially peaking near 10kpc and decreasing faster in the inner regions of M31 than in the outer regions. We finally derived the attenuation map of M31 at 6"/px resolution (\sim 100 pc/px along the plane of M31).[abridged] },

	Abstract = {Dust properties appear to vary according to the environment in which the dust evolves. Previous observational indications of these variations in the FIR and submm spectral range are scarce and limited to specific regions of the sky. To determine whether these results can be generalised to larger scales, we study the evolution in dust emissivities from the FIR to mm wavelengths, in the atomic and molecular ISM, along the Galactic plane towards the outer Galaxy. We correlate the dust FIR to mm emission with the HI and CO emission. The study is carried out using the DIRBE data from 100 to 240 mic, the Archeops data from 550 mic to 2.1 mm, and the WMAP data at 3.2 mm (W band), in regions with Galactic latitude |b| &lt; 30 deg, over the Galactic longitude range (75 deg &lt; l &lt; 198 deg) observed with Archeops. In all regions studied, the emissivity spectra in both the atomic and molecular phases are steeper in the FIR (beta = 2.4) than in the submm and mm (beta = 1.5). We find significant variations in the spectral shape of the dust emissivity as a function of the dust temperature in the molecular phase. Regions of similar dust temperature in the molecular and atomic gas exhibit similar emissivity spectra. Regions where the dust is significantly colder in the molecular phase show a significant increase in emissivity for the range 100 - 550 mic. This result supports the hypothesis of grain coagulation in these regions, confirming results obtained over small fractions of the sky in previous studies and allowing us to expand these results to the cold molecular environments in general of the outer MW. We note that it is the first time that these effects have been demonstrated by direct measurement of the emissivity, while previous studies were based only on thermal arguments. },

Besides, the mid- and far-IR ranges provide key spectral diagnostics of the gas chemistry (water, light hydrides, organic species ...), of the prevailing physical conditions (H2, atomic fine structure lines...), and of the dust mineral and ice composition that can not be observed from ground-based telescopes. With the launch of JAXA's SPICA telescope, uninterrupted studies in the mid- and far-IR will be possible since ESA's Infrared Space Observatory (1995). In particular, SAFARI will provide full access to the 34-210um waveband through several detector arrays and flexible observing modes (from broadband photometry to medium resolution spectroscopy with R~3,000 at 63um), and reaching very high line sensitivities (~10^-19 Wm^-2, 5sigma-1hr) within a large FOV (~2'x2'). Compared to previous far-IR instruments (ISO/LWS, Akari/FIS, Spitzer/MIPS and Herschel/PACS), SAFARI will provide a superior way to obtain fully-sampled spectro-images and continuous SEDs of very faint and extended ISM sources in a wavelength domain not accessible to JWST or ALMA. The much increased sensitivity of SPICA will allow us to step forward and reveal not only the chemical complexity in the local ISM, but also in the extragalactic ISM routinely. },

	Abstract = {The coagulation of dust aggregates occurs in various astrophysical environments. Each one is characterized by different conditions that influence the growth, e.g. relative velocities, composition, and size of the smallest constituents (monomers). Here we study the microphysics of collisions of dust aggregates in a four-dimensional parameter space. The parameters are the collision energy, the initial compactness of agglomerates, the mass ratio of collision partners, and the impact parameter. For this purpose we employ a state of the art molecular dynamics type of model that has been extensively and successfully tested against laboratory experiments. It simulates the motion of individual monomers interacting dynamically via van der Waals surface forces. The structure of aggregates is quantified by the filling factor that provides information about the internal structure, the packing density of monomers, and the projected surface area of aggregates. Our results show the importance of the impact parameter that causes formation of elongated particles, due to tensile forces acting in offset collisions. We also describe in detail the internal structure of the resulting aggregates. Our findings are summarized in the form of a simple collision recipe. The recipe specifies the outcome of a collision, averaged over the impact parameter. It is provided in tabular form for a range of physical parameters such as impact energy and pre-collision filling factor. The dependence on the mass ratio of impactor and target is taken into account by providing both a local and a global branch of the recipe. },

	Abstract = {Galaxies behind the Milky Way suffer size reduction and dimming due to their obscuration by dust in the disk of our Galaxy. The degree of obscuration is wavelength dependent. It decreases towards longer wavelengths. Compared to the optical, the Near InfraRed (NIR) $K_s$ band extinction is only $\approx10%$ that of the $B$ band. This makes NIR surveys well suited for galaxy surveys close to the Galactic Plane where extinction is severe. While Galactic obscuration is less prominent in the NIR it is not negligible. In this paper we derive empirical relations to correct isophotal radii and magnitudes of galaxies observed in the NIR for foreground absorption. We simulate extinction in the $J$, $H$ and $K_s$ bands on 64 (unobscured) galaxies from the 2MASS Large Galaxy Atlas \citep{jarrett}. We propose two methods for the extinction correction, the first is optimized to provide the most accurate correction and the second provides a convenient statistical correction that works adequately in lower extinction regions. The optimized correction utilizes the galaxy surface brightness, either the disk central surface brightness, $\mu_0$, or the combined disk plus bulge central surface brightness, elliptical and disk/spiral Hubble types. A detailed comparison between the different methods and their accuracy is provided. },

	Abstract = {[Abridged] We present a new deep 21-cm survey of the Andromeda galaxy, based on high resolution observations performed with the Synthesis Telescope and the 26-m antenna at DRAO. The HI distribution and kinematics of the disc are analyzed and basic dynamical properties are given. The rotation curve is measured out to 38 kpc, showing a nuclear peak, a dip around 4 kpc, two distinct flat parts and an increase in the outermost regions. Except for the innermost regions, the axisymmetry of the gas rotation is very good. A very strong warp of the HI disc is evidenced. The central regions appear less inclined than the average disc inclination, while the outer regions appear more inclined. Mass distribution models by LCDM NFW, Einasto or pseudo-isothermal dark matter halos with baryonic components are presented. They fail to reproduce the exact shape of the rotation curve. No significant differences are measured between the various shapes of halo. The dynamical mass of M31 enclosed within a radius of 38 kpc is (4.7 +/- 0.5) x 10^11 Msol. The dark matter component is almost 4 times more massive than the baryonic mass inside this radius. A total mass of 1.0 x 10^12 Msol is derived inside the virial radius. New HI structures are discovered in the datacube, like the detection of up to five HI components per spectrum, which is very rarely seen in other galaxies. The most remarkable new HI structures are thin HI spurs and an external arm in the disc outskirts. A relationship between these spurs and outer stellar clumps is evidenced. The external arm is 32 kpc long, lies on the far side of the galaxy and has no obvious counterpart on the other side of the galaxy. Its kinematics clearly differs from the outer adjacent disc. Both these HI perturbations could result from tidal interactions with galaxy companions. },

	Abstract = {Dust in galaxies can be mapped either by the FIR/submillimeter emission, the optical or infrared reddening of starlight, or the extinction of a known background source. We compare two dust extinction measurements for a set of 15 sections in 13 nearby galaxies to determine the scale of the dusty interstellar medium (ISM) responsible for disk opacity: one using stellar reddening and the other a known background source. In our earlier papers, we presented extinction measurements of 29 galaxies, based on calibrated counts of distant background objects identified though foreground disks in Hubble Space Telescope WFPC2 images. For the 13 galaxies that overlap with the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey, we now compare these results with those obtained from an I - L color map. Our goal is to determine whether or not a detected distant galaxy indicates a gap in the dusty ISM, and hence to better understand the nature and geometry of the disk extinction. We find that distant galaxies are predominantly in low-extinction sections marked by the color maps, indicating that their number depends both on the cloud cover of Spitzer-resolved dust structures, mostly the spiral arms, and a diffuse, unresolved underlying disk. We note that our infrared color map [E(I - L)] underestimates the overall dust presence in these disks severely because it implicitly assumes the presence of a dust screen in front of the stellar distribution. },

	Abstract = {Using the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, we have obtained deep high-resolution CCD images in V and I of a 28<SUP>'</SUP>&#215;28<SUP>'</SUP> field in the outer disk of M31 at ~116' from the center along the major axis to the southwest and covering a range of projected galactocentric distance from about 23 to 33 kpc. The field was chosen to correspond with extended H I features recorded near the H I edge of the galaxy. The many tens of thousands of objects detected in this large field have been classified using an automatic algorithm that distinguishes unresolved from resolved structures and provides photometry on them. For the most part the unresolved objects are stars in M31. The V-I colors of these stars are highly correlated with the column density of H I in the field. Assuming a Galactic extinction law, this yields a minimum extinction/atomic gas ratio about one-third of that in the solar neighborhood. The interstellar medium (ISM) in this outer disk of M31 therefore contains substantial amounts of dust. We have identified a population of B stars in the field whose distribution is also well correlated with the extended H I distribution. Evidently, star formation is both ongoing and wide spread in the outer disk of M31. According to the current view of the star formation process, molecular gas is therefore also expected to be present. The objects classified as ``resolved'' turn out to be a mix of background galaxies and overlapping images of foreground stars in M31. The counts and colors of the slightly resolved objects in these ground-based CCD images therefore cannot be used for a reliable determination of the total extinction and reddening by the ISM in M31. However, the larger background galaxies are easily recognizable, and their surface density above a specific magnitude limit is anticorrelated with the H I column density, confirming that a relatively large amount of extinction is closely associated with the H I gas. },

	Abstract = {With the goal of investigating the degree to which the MIR emission traces the SFR, we analyze Spitzer 8 and 24 mum data of star-forming regions in a sample of 33 nearby galaxies with available HST NICMOS images in the Paalpha (1.8756 mum) emission line. The galaxies are drawn from the SINGS sample and cover a range of morphologies and a factor ~10 in oxygen abundance. Published data on local low-metallicity starburst galaxies and LIRGs are also included in the analysis. Both the stellar continuum-subtracted 8 mum emission and the 24 mum emission correlate with the extinction-corrected Paalpha line emission, although neither relationship is linear. Simple models of stellar populations and dust extinction and emission are able to reproduce the observed nonlinear trend of the 24 mum emission versus number of ionizing photons, including the modest deficiency of 24 mum emission in the low-metallicity regions, which results from a combination of decreasing dust opacity and dust temperature at low luminosities. Conversely, the trend of the 8 mum emission as a function of the number of ionizing photons is not well reproduced by the same models. The 8 mum emission is contributed, in larger measure than the 24 mum emission, by dust heated by nonionizing stellar populations, in addition to the ionizing ones, in agreement with previous findings. Two SFR calibrations, one using the 24 mum emission and the other using a combination of the 24 mum and Halpha luminosities (Kennicutt and coworkers), are presented. No calibration is presented for the 8 mum emission because of its significant dependence on both metallicity and environment. The calibrations presented here should be directly applicable to systems dominated by ongoing star formation.<p/>  Based on observations obtained with the Spitzer Space Telescope, which is operated by JPL, Caltech, under NASA contract 1407, and with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555. },

	Abstract = {We construct a large data set of global structural parameters for 1300 field and cluster spiral galaxies and explore the joint distribution of luminosity L, optical rotation velocity V, and disk size R at I and 2MASS K bands. The I- and K-band velocity-luminosity (VL) relations have log slopes of 0.29 and 0.27, respectively, with sigma<SUB>ln</SUB>(VL)~0.13, and show a small dependence on color and morphological type in the sense that redder, earlier type disk galaxies rotate faster than bluer, later type disk galaxies for most luminosities. The VL relation at I and K bands is independent of surface brightness, size, and light concentration. The log slope of the I- and K-band size-luminosity (RL) relations is a strong function of morphology and varies from 0.25 to 0.5, with a mean of 0.32 for all Hubble types. At most luminosities, early-type disk galaxies have shorter scale lengths than later type ones. The average dispersion sigma<SUB>ln</SUB>(RL) decreases from 0.33 at I band to 0.29 at K, likely due to the 2MASS selection bias against lower surface brightness galaxies. The VL and RL residuals are largely uncorrelated with each other with a correlation coefficient r=-0.16 and DeltalogV|L/DeltalogR|L=-0.07+/-0.01 the RV-RL residuals show a weak positive correlation with r=0.53. These correlations suggest that scatter in luminosity is not a significant source of the scatter in the VL and RL relations. We discuss in two Appendices various pitfalls of standard analytical derivations of galaxy scaling relations, including the Tully-Fisher relation with different slopes.

	Abstract = {We give an overview of the factors shaping the ultraviolet (UV)/optical - far-infrared (FIR)/submillimeter (submm) spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of normal (non-starburst) galaxies. Particular emphasis is placed on the influence of the geometry of dust and stars on the propagation of light through the interstellar medium. Although strong constraints can be placed on the amount and large scale distribution of dust in disks from the appearance of the galaxies in the optical/UV range, this dust does not account for the observed amplitude and colour of the FIR/submm radiation. Additional, optically thick components of dust associated with the young stellar population on large and small scales are required to account for the complete UV/optical - FIR/submm SEDs. Self-consistent models for the calculation of SEDs of spiral galaxies are reviewed, and their predictions for the dust emission and the attenuation of starlight are compared and contrasted. },

@article{Kennicutt:2009,
	Abstract = {We combine Halpha emission-line and infrared (IR) continuum measurements of two samples of nearby galaxies to derive dust attenuation-corrected star formation rates (SFRs). We use a simple energy balance based method that has been applied previously to H II regions in the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey, and extend the methodology to integrated measurements of galaxies. We find that our composite Halpha + IR based SFRs are in excellent agreement with attenuation-corrected SFRs derived from integrated spectrophotometry, over the full range of SFRs (0.01-80 M <SUB>sun</SUB>&#160;yr<SUP>--1</SUP>) and attenuations (0-2.5 mag) studied. We find that the combination of Halpha and total IR luminosities provides the most robust SFR measurements, but combinations of Halpha measurements with monochromatic luminosities at 24&#160;mum and 8&#160;mum perform nearly as well. The calibrations differ significantly from those obtained for H II regions, with the difference attributable to a more evolved population of stars heating the dust. Our results are consistent with a significant component of diffuse dust (the "IR cirrus" component) that is heated by a non-star-forming population. The same methodology can be applied to [O II]lambda3727 emission-line measurements, and the radio continuum fluxes of galaxies can be applied in place of IR fluxes when the latter are not available. We assess the precision and systematic reliability of all of these composite methods. },

	Abstract = {We present a method to estimate and map the two-dimensional distribution of dust extinction in the late-type spiral galaxy NGC 959 from the theoretical and observed flux ratio of optical V and mid-IR (MIR) 3.6 micron images. Our method is applicable to both young and old stellar populations for a range of metallicities, and is not restricted to lines-of-sight toward star-formation (SF) regions. We explore this method using a pixel-based analysis on images of NGC 959 obtained in the V-band at the Vatican Advanced Technology Telescope (VATT) and at 3.6 micron (L-band) with Spitzer/IRAC. We present the original and extinction corrected GALEX far-UV (FUV) and near-UV (NUV) images, as well as optical UBVR images of NGC 959. While the dust lanes are not clearly evident at GALEX resolution, our dust map clearly traces the dust that can be seen silhouetted against the galaxy's disk in the high-resolution HST images of NGC 959. The advantages of our method are: (1) it only depends on two relatively common broadband images in the optical V-band and in the MIR at 3.6 micron (but adding a near-UV band improves its fidelity); and (2) it is able to map the two-dimensional spatial distribution of dust within a galaxy. This powerful tool could be used to measure the detailed distribution of dust extinction within higher redshift galaxies to be observed with, e.g., the HST/WFC3 (optical--near-IR) and JWST (mid-IR), and to distinguish properties of dust within galaxy bulges, spiral arms, and inter-arm regions. },

	Abstract = {We analyze the dependence of circumstellar extinction on core mass for the brightest planetary nebulae (PNs) in the Magellanic Clouds and M31. We show that in all three galaxies, a statistically significant correlation exists between the two quantities, such that high-core mass objects have greater extinction. We model this behavior and show that the relation is a simple consequence of the greater mass loss and faster evolution times of high-mass stars. The relation is important because it provides a natural explanation for the invariance of the [O III] lambda5007 planetary nebula luminosity function (PNLF) with population age: bright Population I PNs are extinguished below the cutoff of the PNLF. It also explains the counter-intuitive observation that intrinsically luminous Population I PNs often appear fainter than PNs from older, low-mass progenitors. },

@article{Galarza:1999,
	Abstract = {We present results of Kitt Peak National Observatory (KPNO) 4 m optical spectroscopy of discrete emission-line nebulae and regions of diffuse ionized gas (DIG) in M31. Long-slit spectra of 16 positions in the northeast half of M31 were obtained over a 5-15 kpc range in radial distance from the center of the galaxy with special attention to the annulus of high star formation between 8 and 12 kpc. Slit positions were chosen such that several emission-line nebulae and large sections of diffuse gas could be studied without compromising the parallactic angle. The spectra have been used to confirm 16 supernova remnant (SNR) candidates from the Braun &#38; Walterbos (1993) catalog. The slits also covered 46 H II regions that show significant differences among the various morphological types (center-brightened, diffuse, rings). Radial gradients in emission-line ratios such as [O III]/Hbeta and [O II]/[O III] are observed most prominently in the center-brightened H II regions. These line-ratio trends are either much weaker or completely absent in the diffuse and ring nebulae. The line-ratio gradients seen previously in M31 SNRs by Blair, Kirshner, &#38; Chevalier in 1981 and 1982 are reproduced well by our new data. The spectra of center-brightened H II regions and SNRs confirm previous determinations of the radial abundance gradient in M31. We use diagnostic diagrams that separate photoionized gas from shock-ionized gas to compare the spectral properties of H II regions, SNRs, and DIG. This analysis strengthens the earlier claims made by Greenawalt, Walterbos, &#38; Braun in 1997 that the DIG in the disk of M31 is photoionized by a dilute radiation field. },

We present the standard intensity profile, and its various guises such as the luminosity, surface-brightness, and aperture-magnitude profile. Expressions to transform the effective surface brightness into the mean effective and central surface brightness are also given, as is the expression to transform between effective radii and exponential scale-lengths. We additionally provide expressions for deriving the `concentration' of an R<SUP>1/n</SUP> profile, and two useful equations for the logarithmic slope of the light-profile are given. Petrosian radii and fluxes are also derived for a range of S&#233;rsic profiles and compared with the effective radii and total flux. Similarly, expressions to obtain Kron radii and fluxes are presented as a function of the S&#233;rsic index n and the number of effective radii sampled. Illustrative figures are provided throughout. Finally, the core-S&#233;rsic model, consisting of an inner power-law and an outer S&#233;rsic function, is presented. },

	Abstract = {We explore the near-infrared (NIR) K-band properties of galaxies within 93 galaxy clusters and groups using data from the Two Micron All Sky Survey. We use X-ray properties of these clusters to pinpoint cluster centers and estimate cluster masses. By stacking all these systems, we study the shape of the cluster luminosity function and the galaxy distribution within the clusters. We find that the galaxy profile is well described by the Navarro, Frenk, &#38; White (NFW) profile with a concentration parameter c~3, with no evidence for cluster mass dependence of the concentration. Using this sample, whose masses span the range from 3&#215;10<SUP>13</SUP> to 2&#215;10<SUP>15</SUP>M<SUB>solar</SUB>, we confirm the existence of a tight correlation between total galaxy NIR luminosity and cluster binding mass, which indicates that NIR light can serve as a cluster mass indicator. From the observed galaxy profile, together with cluster mass profile measurements from the literature, we find that the mass-to-light ratio is a weakly decreasing function of cluster radius and that it increases with cluster mass. We also derive the mean number of galaxies within halos of a given mass, the halo occupation number. We find that the mean number scales as N~M<SUP>0.84+/-0.04</SUP> for galaxies brighter than M<SUB>K</SUB>=-21, indicating that high-mass clusters have fewer galaxies per unit mass than low-mass clusters. Using published observations at high redshift, we show that higher redshift clusters have higher mean occupation numbers than nearby systems of the same mass. By comparing the luminosity function and radial distribution of galaxies in low-mass and high-mass clusters, we show that there is a marked decrease in the number density of galaxies fainter than M<SUB>*</SUB> as one moves to higher mass clusters; in addition, extremely luminous galaxies are more probable in high-mass clusters. We explore several processes, including tidal interactions and merging, as a way of explaining the variation in galaxy population with cluster mass. },

	Abstract = {We present results from the Spitzer MIPS instrument regarding the spatial distribution of cold dust emission in a variety of nearby galaxies. Large masses of cold dust can be observed surrounding objects of varying physical size and morphological type, including galaxies quite low in mass. In several cases, the cold dust emission represented by the MIPS 160 micron images extends beyond the optical and near-infrared disks of galaxies. The amount of detectable cold dust emission is likely dependent on the amount of diffuse, nonionizing ultraviolet photons produced by the young stellar population. Therefore, many more galaxies with lower rates of star formation may have large amounts of very cold dust that escape detection. The existence of such cold dust halos allows us to probe issues regarding the assembly, storage, and retention of dust in disk galaxies and to better understand how the dust interacts with its environment. For instance, tracing gas-to-dust ratios far into disks allows us to distinguish between methods of dust production and transportation, and comparing with other wavelengths enables us to locate the sources of dust heating. },

	Abstract = {The photographic images of a carefully selected sample of about 16,000 galaxies have been digitized, and an extensive set of photometric parameters has been determined. These data allow a reanalysis of the effective transparency using the measured surface brightness profiles for much larger, more strictly defined samples. Several tests provide evidence that the major parts of many spiral disks are opaque and that in many cases perhaps only the outer layer of stars is observable. This invalidates most determinations of mass-to-light ratios. Various photometric properties point to an obscuring component with a larger exponential scale length than obscuring component with a larger exponential scale length than that of the stars, possibly composed of cool compact opaque clouds. This result diminishes the evidence for weak haloes around spirals, as inferred from rotation curves. },

	Abstract = {Even though the interstellar medium (ISM) in a galaxy plays a critical role in its evolution, it is difficult to quantitatively measure the ISM content of a galaxy when the gas is primarily molecular. In this paper I present a method for quantitatively deriving the dust mass in a galaxy using optical and near-infrared images. These images are used as inputs to a radiative transfer model to generate a dust optical depth map. By simulating observational errors, I show that up to an optical depth of A<SUB>V</SUB>=8 the model is not affected by saturation effects. The method is then applied to the central region (&lt;1.5 kpc) of four nearby spiral galaxies and is used to calibrate the conversion factor between CO luminosity and H<SUB>2</SUB> mass. The resulting conversion factor shows that the CO is overluminous by a factor of at least 5-20 compared to the CO in the solar neighborhood. I also show that in the absence of a full set of optical and near-infrared colors an I-K color map is a good qualitative representation of the dust morphology of a galaxy. },

	Abstract = {I review the effects of dust, both in absorption and in emission, on the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of local star-forming galaxies. The energy balance between the stellar light absorbed by dust at UV-optical-near-IR wavelengths and the energy re-emitted by dust in the far-infrared (FIR) shows that the amount of dust extinction affecting the galaxy can be predicted with simple prescriptions applied to the UV-optical data. The implications of these results for high redshift galaxies are discussed. Arguments can be given to support the view that local starbursts are representative of high-redshift (/z&gt;2), UV-detected, star-forming galaxies. If this is the case, the high redshift FIR emission will be generally undetected in sub-mm surveys, unless: (1) the bolometric luminosity of the high-/z galaxies is comparable to or larger than that of local ultra-luminous FIR galaxies; and (2) their FIR SED contains a cool dust component. },

	Abstract = {We identified 46 unresolved source candidates in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF) down to i<SUB>775</SUB>=29.5. Unresolved objects were identified using a parameter S, which measures the deviation from the curve of growth of a point source. Extensive testing of this parameter was carried out, including the effects of decreasing signal-to-noise ratio and of the apparent motions of stars, which demonstrated that stars brighter than i<SUB>775</SUB>=27.0 could be robustly identified. Low-resolution grism spectra of the 28 objects brighter than i<SUB>775</SUB>=27.0 identify 18 M and later stellar type dwarfs, two candidate L dwarfs, two QSOs, and four white dwarfs. Using the observed population of dwarfs with spectral type M4 or later, we derive a Galactic disk scale height of 400+/-100 pc for M and L stars. The local white dwarf density is computed to be as high as (1.1+/-0.3)&#215;10<SUP>-2</SUP> stars pc<SUP>-3</SUP>. On the basis of observations taken 73 days apart, we determined that no object in the field has a proper motion larger than 0.027" yr<SUP>-1</SUP> (3 sigma detection limit). No high-velocity white dwarfs were identified in the HUDF, and all four candidates appear more likely to be part of the Galactic thick disk. The lack of detected halo white dwarfs implies that if the dark matter halo is 12 Gyr old, white dwarfs account for less than 10% of the dark matter halo mass. },

	Abstract = {Galaxies, in particular disc galaxies, contain a number of structures and substructures with well defined morphological, photometric and kinematic properties. Considerable theoretical effort has been put into explaining their formation and evolution, both analytically and with numerical simulations. In some theories, structures form during the natural evolution of the galaxy, i.e. they are a result of nature. For others, it is the interaction with other galaxies, or with the intergalactic medium -- i.e. nurture -- that accounts for a structure. Either way, the existence and properties of these structures reveal important information on the underlying potential of the galaxy, i.e. on the amount and distribution of matter -- including the dark matter -- in it, and on the evolutionary history of the galaxy. Here, I will briefly review the various formation scenarios and the respective role of nature and nurture in the formation, evolution and properties of the main structures and substructures. },

	Abstract = {We present a Fundamental Plane (FP) analysis of 141 early-type galaxies in the Shapley supercluster at z = 0.049 based on spectroscopy from the AAOmega spectrograph at the Anglo-Australian Telescope and photometry from the WFI on the European Southern Observatory/MPI 2.2-m telescope. The key feature of the survey is its coverage of low-mass galaxies down to sigma ~ 50kms<SUP>-1</SUP>. We obtain a best-fitting FP relation r<SUB>e</SUB> ~ sigma<SUP>1.06+/-0.06</SUP><SUB>0</SUB>&lt;I&gt;<SUP>-0.82+/-0.02</SUP><SUB>e</SUB> in the R band. The shallow exponent of sigma<SUB>0</SUB> is a result of the extension of our sample to low velocity dispersions. Considering the subsample of sigma<SUB>0</SUB> &gt; 100kms<SUP>-1</SUP> galaxies, the FP relation is r<SUB>e</SUB> ~ sigma<SUP>1.35</SUP> &lt;I&gt;<SUP>-0.81</SUP><SUB>e</SUB>, consistent with previous studies in the high-luminosity regime. We investigate the origin of the intrinsic FP scatter, using estimates of age, metallicity and alpha/Fe. We find that the FP residuals anticorrelate (&gt;3sigma) with the mean stellar age in agreement with previous work. However, a stronger (&gt;4sigma) correlation with alpha/Fe is also found. These correlations indicate that galaxies with effective radii smaller than those predicted by the FP have stellar populations systematically older and with alpha overabundances larger than average, for their sigma. Including alpha/Fe as a fourth parameter in the FP, the total scatter decreases from 0.088 to 0.075dex and the estimated intrinsic scatter decreases from 0.068 to 0.049dex. Thus, variations in alpha/Fe account for ~30 per cent of the total variance around the FP, and ~50 per cent of the estimated intrinsic variance. This result indicates that the distribution of galaxies around the FP are tightly related to the enrichment, and hence to the time-scale of star formation. Our results appear to be consistent with the merger hypothesis for the formation of ellipticals which predicts that a significant fraction of the scatter is due to variations in the importance of dissipation in forming merger remnants of a given mass. },

	Abstract = {We present an updated catalogue of M31 globular clusters (GCs) based on images from the Wide Field CAMera (WFCAM) on the UK Infrared Telescope and from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Our catalogue includes new, self-consistent ugriz and K-band photometry of these clusters. We discuss the difficulty of obtaining accurate photometry of clusters projected against M31 due to small scale background structure in the galaxy. We consider the effect of this on the accuracy of our photometry and provide realistic photometric error estimates. We investigate possible contamination in the current M31 GC catalogues using the excellent spatial resolution of these WFCAM images combined with the SDSS multicolour photometry. We identify a large population of clusters with very blue colours. Most of these have recently been proposed by other work as young clusters. We distinguish between these, and old clusters, in the final classifications. Our final catalogue includes 416 old clusters, 156 young clusters and 373 candidate clusters. We also investigate the structure of M31's old GCs using previously published King model fits to these WFCAM images. We demonstrate that the structure and colours of M31's old GC system are similar to those of the Milky Way. One GC (B383) is found to be significantly brighter in previous observations than observed here. We investigate all of the previous photometry of this GC and suggest that this variability appears to be genuine and short lived. We propose that the large increase in its luminosity my have been due to a classical nova in the GC at the time of the previous observations in 1989. },

	Abstract = {We investigate the interaction history of the M31 subgroup by comparing surface photometry of two of its satellites, M32 and NGC 205, with N-body simulations of satellite destruction. The recent discovery of a giant stream in the outer halo of M31, apparently pointed in the direction of M32 and NGC 205, makes such an investigation particularly relevant. The observational component of this study is based on 1.7d&#215;5&deg; B- and I-band CCD mosaic images centered on M31 and covering both satellites. Standard ellipse-fitting techniques are used to model and remove M31 disk light and to perform surface photometry on the satellites to limiting brightness levels of (mu<SUB>B</SUB>,mu<SUB>I</SUB>)=(27,25) mag arcsec<SUP>-2</SUP>, corresponding to isophotal semimajor axis lengths of r<SUP>M32</SUP><SUB>lim</SUB>=420<SUP>''</SUP> (1.6 kpc) and r<SUP>NGC205</SUP><SUB>lim</SUB>=720" (2.7 kpc). A hint of excess light in the outer parts of M32 noted in earlier studies is confirmed; in particular, clear evidence is seen for a sharp (upward) break in the surface brightness profile at r=150" relative to a r<SUP>1/4</SUP> law that fits the inner region of M32. This break is accompanied by a steep increase in isophotal ellipticity &epsilon;, as well as position angle phi' twisting. In addition to this excess, evidence is seen for an inner downward break in the surface brightness profile at r=50". The robustness of the M32 isophotal features is demonstrated through their (1) insensitivity to the details of background subtraction, (2) symmetry about M32's center, and (3) narrow range of B-I color that is consistent with the interior regions of M32 but not with M31 residual spiral arm/dust lane features. The study of NGC 205 reveals pronounced isophote twisting at r~300" that is coincident with a subtle downward break in the surface brightness profile, relative to an exponential law fitted to the inner region. The simulation component of this project is based on the analysis of single-component, spherical satellites that are being tidally disrupted through interactions with their parent galaxy. Generic features of the simulations include an excess in the surface brightness profile at large radii, a depletion zone at intermediate radii, and isophotal elongation and twists that are coincident with breaks in the brightness profile. The two satellites, M32 and NGC 205, display most of these features consistently across the B and I bands, which is strongly suggestive of tidal interaction and probable stripping by M31. We discuss what these observed features can tell us about the satellites' orbital parameters and histories. Specifically, M32 is found to be on a highly eccentric orbit and away from pericenter. Investigating M32's unusual combination of high surface brightness and low luminosity (the hallmark of compact ellipticals), we make empirical estimates of the galaxy's intrinsic properties and conclude that it is not likely to be the residual core of a tidally stripped normal elliptical galaxy, as has been suggested, but rather that its precursor was intrinsically compact.

	Abstract = {The yellow supergiant content of nearby galaxies can provide a critical test of stellar evolution theory, bridging the gap between the hot, massive stars and the cool red supergiants. But, this region of the color-magnitude diagram is dominated by foreground contamination, requiring membership to somehow be determined. Fortunately, the large negative systemic velocity of M31, coupled to its high rotation rate, provides the means for separating the contaminating foreground dwarfs from the bona fide yellow supergiants within M31. We obtained radial velocities of ~2900 individual targets within the correct color-magnitude range corresponding to masses of 12 M <SUB>sun</SUB> and higher. A comparison of these velocities to those expected from M31's rotation curve reveals 54 rank-1 (near certain) and 66 rank-2 (probable) yellow supergiant members, indicating a foreground contamination &gt;= 96%. We expect some modest contamination from Milky Way halo giants among the remainder, particularly for the rank-2 candidates, and indeed follow-up spectroscopy of a small sample eliminates four rank 2's while confirming five others. We find excellent agreement between the location of yellow supergiants in the H-R diagram and that predicted by the latest Geneva evolutionary tracks that include rotation. However, the relative number of yellow supergiants seen as a function of mass varies from that predicted by the models by a factor of &gt;10, in the sense that more high-mass yellow supergiants are predicted than those are actually observed. Comparing the total number (16) of &gt;20 M <SUB>sun</SUB> yellow supergiants with the estimated number (24,800) of unevolved O stars indicates that the duration of the yellow supergiant phase is ~3000 years. This is consistent with what the 12 M <SUB>sun</SUB> and 15 M <SUB>sun</SUB> evolutionary tracks predict, but disagrees with the 20,000-80,000 year timescales predicted by the models for higher masses.<p/>  Observations reported here were obtained at the MMT Observatory, a joint facility of the University of Arizona and the Smithsonian Institution. },

	Abstract = {We measure star formation rates (SFRs) of ~50,000 optically selected galaxies in the local universe (z~0.1)-from gas-rich dwarfs to massive ellipticals. We obtain dust-corrected SFRs by fitting the GALEX (ultraviolet) and SDSS photometry to a library of dust-attenuated population synthesis models. For star-forming galaxies, our UV-based SFRs compare remarkably well with those from SDSS-measured emission lines (Halpha). Deviations from perfect agreement are shown to be due to differences in the dust attenuation estimates. In contrast to Halpha measurements, UV provides reliable SFRs for galaxies with weak Halpha, and where Halpha is contaminated with AGN emission (1/2 of the sample). Using full-SED SFRs, we calibrate a simple prescription that uses GALEX far- and near-UV magnitudes to produce dust-corrected SFRs for normal star-forming galaxies. The specific SFR is considered as a function of stellar mass for (1) star-forming galaxies with no AGNs, (2) those hosting an AGN, and (3) galaxies without Halpha emission. We find that the three have distinct star formation histories, with AGNs lying intermediate between the star-forming and the quiescent galaxies. Star-forming galaxies without an AGN lie on a relatively narrow linear sequence. Remarkably, galaxies hosting a strong AGN appear to represent the massive continuation of this sequence. On the other hand, weak AGNs, while also massive, have lower SFRs, sometimes extending to the realm of quiescent galaxies. We propose an evolutionary sequence for massive galaxies that smoothly connects normal star-forming galaxies to quiescent galaxies via strong and weak AGNs. We confirm that some galaxies with no Halpha show signs of star formation in the UV. We derive a cosmic star formation density at z=0.1 with significantly smaller total error than previous measurements. },

	Abstract = {We refine a technique to measure the absorption-corrected ultraviolet (UV) luminosity of starburst galaxies using rest-frame UV quantities alone and apply it to Lyman-limit U dropouts at z~3 found in the Hubble Deep Field (HDF). The method is based on an observed correlation between the ratio of far-infrared (FIR) to UV fluxes with spectral slope beta (a UV color). A simple fit to this relation allows the UV flux absorbed by dust and reprocessed to the FIR to be calculated, and hence the dust-free UV luminosity to be determined. International Ultraviolet Explorer spectra and Infrared Astronomical Satellite fluxes of local starbursts are used to calibrate the F_FIR/F_1600 versus beta relation in terms of A_1600 (the dust absorption at 1600 &#197;) and the transformation from broadband photometric color to beta. Both calibrations are almost completely independent of theoretical stellar-population models. We show that the recent marginal and nondetections of HDF U dropouts at radio and submillimeter wavelengths are consistent with their assumed starburst nature and our calculated A_1600. This is also true of recent observations of the ratio of optical emission-line flux to UV flux density in the brightest U dropouts. This latter ratio turns out not to be a good indicator of dust extinction. In U dropouts, absolute magnitude M_1600,0 correlates with beta: brighter galaxies are redder, as is observed to be the case for local starburst galaxies. This suggests that a mass-metallicity relationship is already in place at z~3. The absorption-corrected UV luminosity function of U dropouts extends up to M_1600,0~-24 AB mag, corresponding to a star formation rate ~200 M_solar yr^-1 (H_0=50 km s^-1 Mpc^-3 and q_0=0.5 are assumed throughout). The absorption-corrected UV luminosity density at z~3 is rho_1600,0&gt;=1.4x10^27 ergs^-1 Hz^-1 Mpc^-1. It is still a lower limit since completeness corrections have not been done and because only galaxies with A_1600&lt;~3.6 mag are blue enough in the UV to be selected as U dropouts. The luminosity-weighted mean dust-absorption factor of our sample is 5.4+/-0.9 at 1600 &#197;. },

	Abstract = {Compared to starburst galaxies, normal star forming galaxies have been shown to display a much larger dispersion of the dust attenuation at fixed reddening through studies of the IRX-beta diagram (the IR/UV ratio "IRX" versus the UV color "beta"). To investigate the causes of this larger dispersion and attempt to isolate second parameters, we have used GALEX UV, ground-based optical, and Spitzer infrared imaging of 8 nearby galaxies, and examined the properties of individual UV and 24 micron selected star forming regions. We concentrated on star-forming regions, in order to isolate simpler star formation histories than those that characterize whole galaxies. We find that 1) the dispersion is not correlated with the mean age of the stellar populations, 2) a range of dust geometries and dust extinction curves are the most likely causes for the observed dispersion in the IRX-beta diagram 3) together with some potential dilution of the most recent star-forming population by older unrelated bursts, at least in the case of star-forming regions within galaxies, 4) we also recover some general characteristics of the regions, including a tight positive correlation between the amount of dust attenuation and the metal content. Although generalizing our results to whole galaxies may not be immediate, the possibility of a range of dust extinction laws and geometries should be accounted for in the latter systems as well. },

	Abstract = {The star formation history of the northern and southern M31 disk is measured using samples of BV photometry for 4<SUP>'</SUP>&#215;4<SUP>'</SUP> regions taken from the KPNO/CTIO Local Group Survey. The distances, mean reddening values, and age distributions of the stars in these regions were measured using the routines of Dolphin. Independent measurements of overlapping fields show that the results are stable for most samples. A slight distance gradient is seen across the major axis of the southern disk, and a mean distance of 24.47+/-0.03 is found by combining the results. Higher mean reddening values are seen to follow the spiral structure. The stellar age distributions are consistent with episodic star formation confined mainly to the gas-rich arm regions. If these episodes were caused by propagating density waves, the waves did not cause significant star formation episodes in the gas-poor interarm regions. A combination of all of the results provides the total star formation rate for 1.4 deg<SUP>2</SUP> of the M31 disk for six epochs. These results suggest that star formation in the disk declined by ~50% from ~250 to ~50 Myr ago. The lowest star formation rate occurred ~25 Myr ago, followed by a ~20% increase to the present. The mean star formation rate for this large portion of M31 over the past 60 Myr is 0.63+/-0.07 M<SUB>solar</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, suggesting a total mean rate for the disk of ~1 M<SUB>solar</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. },

These two components provide a new framework for galaxy morphology classification in which the presence of spiral arms and their emission strength relative to the starlight can be measured directly and with high contrast. Four mid-infrared classification methods are explored, three of which are based on quantitative global parameters (colors and bulge-to-disk ratio) that are similar to those used in the past for optical studies; in this limited sample, all correlate well with traditional B-band classification. We suggest reasons why infrared classification may be superior to optical classification. },

	Abstract = {It is shown here that most previous attempts to derive the inclination dependence of luminosity and diameter for spiral galaxies could have been afflicted by severe sample selection effects. In the absence of distance information, analysis of a diameter-selected sample will reach one conclusion, and the same kind of analysis of a luminosity-selected sample will reach the opposite conclusion. It is shown that, when distances are used, well-selected samples of spirals can yield reliable inclination corrections. When distance-related tests are applied to diameter-limited samples of the Uppsala General Catalogue of Galaxies, it is found that apparent diameter is independent of inclination for the spirals. This implies that the luminosities of spirals are inclination-dependent, becoming much fainter as they are viewed more edge-on. },

	Abstract = {We have performed a wide-area ultraviolet (UV) imaging survey using the GALaxy Evolution eXplorer to search for bright, point-like UV sources behind M31's extended halo. Our survey consisted of 46 pointings covering an effective area of ~50deg<SUP>2</SUP>, in both the far-UV and near-UV channels. We combined these data with optical R-band observations acquired with the WIYN Mosaic-1 imager on the Kitt Peak National Observatory 0.9-m WIYN telescope. An analysis of the brightness and colours of sources matched between our photometric catalogues yielded ~100 UV-bright quasar candidates. We have obtained discovery spectra for 76 of these targets with the Kast spectrometer on the Lick 3-m telescope and confirmed 30 active galactic nuclei and quasars, 29 galaxies at z &gt; 0.02 including several early-type systems, 16 Galactic stars (hot main-sequence stars) and one featureless source previously identified as a BL Lac object. Future UV spectroscopy of the brightest targets with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope will enable a systematic search for diffuse gas in the extended halo of M31. },

	Abstract = {The giant southern stream (GSS) is the most prominent tidal debris feature in M31's stellar halo and covers a significant fraction of its southern quadrant. The GSS is a complex structure composed of a relatively metal-rich, high-surface-brightness "core" and a lower metallicity, lower-surface-brightness "envelope." We present spectroscopy of red giant stars in six fields in the vicinity of M31's GSS (including four new fields and improved spectroscopic reductions for two previously published fields) and one field on stream C, an arc-like feature seen in star-count maps on M31's southeast minor axis at R ~ 60 kpc. These data are part of our ongoing Spectroscopic and Photometric Landscape of Andromeda's Stellar Halo survey of M31 using the DEIMOS instrument on the Keck II 10 m telescope. Several GSS-related findings and measurements are presented here. We present the innermost kinematical detection of the GSS core to date (R = 17 kpc). This field also contains the inner continuation of a second kinematically cold component that was originally seen in a GSS core field at R ~ 21 kpc. The velocity gradients of the GSS and the second component in the combined data set are parallel over a range of DeltaR = 7 kpc, suggesting that this may represent a bifurcation in the line-of-sight velocities of GSS stars. We present the first kinematical detection of substructure in the GSS envelope (S quadrant, R ~ 58 kpc). Using kinematically identified samples, we show that the envelope debris has a ~0.7 dex lower mean photometric metallicity and possibly higher intrinsic velocity dispersion than the GSS core. The GSS is also identified in the field of the M31 dwarf spheroidal satellite And I; the GSS in this field has a metallicity distribution identical to that of the GSS core. We confirm the previous finding of two kinematically cold components in stream C, and measure intrinsic velocity dispersions of ~10 and ~4 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. This compilation of the kinematical (mean velocity, intrinsic velocity dispersion) and chemical properties of stars in the GSS core and envelope, coupled with published surface-brightness measurements and wide-area star-count maps, will improve constraints on the orbit and internal structure of the dwarf satellite progenitor. },

	Abstract = {We present a photometric survey of the stellar halo of the Andromeda galaxy, using Suprime-Cam on the Subaru Telescope. A detailed analysis of VI color-magnitude diagrams of the resolved stellar population is used to measure properties such as line-of-sight distance, surface brightness, metallicity, and age, and these are used to isolate and characterize different components of the M31 halo: (1) several substructures, and (2) the smooth halo. First, we study M31's halo substructure along the north-west/south-east minor axis out to R ~ 100 kpc and the south-west major axis region at R ~ 60 kpc. We confirm two substructures in the south-east halo reported by Ibata et al. (2007) and discover two overdense substructures in the north-west halo. We investigate the properties of these four substructures as well as other structures including the western shelf and find that differences in stellar populations among these systems, thereby suggesting each has a different origin. Our statistical analysis implies that the M31 halo as a whole may contain at least 16 substructures, each with a different origin. Second, we investigate the properties of an underlying, smooth and extended halo component out to R &gt; 100 kpc. We find that the surface density of this smooth halo can be fitted to a Hernquist model of scale radius ~ 17 kpc or a power-law profile with ~ R^{-2.17 +/- 0.15}. In contrast to the relative smoothness of the halo density profile, its metallicity distribution appears to be spatially non-uniform with non-monotonic variations with radius, suggesting that the halo may still be undergoing chemo-dynamical evolution. },

	Abstract = {We present HST photometry of the resolved stellar population in the dwarf irregular galaxy NGC 1705. The galaxy has been observed with both WFPC2 and NICMOS, and successful images have been obtained in the F555W, F814W, F110W, and F160W bands. The optical fields cover most of the galaxy, while the infrared field (NIC2) maps only its central regions. The optical photometry provides ~20,000 objects down to m<SUB>F555W</SUB>&lt;~29 in the PC field of view and ~20,000 in the three WFCs. In the infrared we have been able to resolve ~2400 stars down to m<SUB>F110W</SUB>, m<SUB>F160W</SUB> ~26. A subsample of 1834 stars has been unambiguously measured in all four bands. The corresponding color-magnitude diagrams confirm the existence of an age gradient, showing that NGC 1705 hosts both young (a few megayears) and very old (up to 15 Gyr) stars, with the former strongly concentrated toward the galactic center and the latter present everywhere, but much more easily visible in the external regions. The tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) is clearly visible both in the optical and in the infrared CMDs and allows us to derive the galaxy distance. Taking into account the uncertainties related to both the photometry and the TRGB magnitude-distance relation, we find that the distance modulus of NGC 1705 is (m-M)<SUB>0</SUB>=28.54+/-0.26, corresponding to a distance D=5.1+/-0.6 Mpc. Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA), Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555. },

	Abstract = {We review the physical properties of nearby, relatively luminous galaxies, using results from newly available massive data sets together with more detailed observations. First, we present the global distribution of properties, including the optical and ultraviolet (UV) luminosity, stellar mass, and atomic gas mass functions. Second, we describe the shift of the galaxy population from late galaxy types in underdense regions to early galaxy types in overdense regions. We emphasize that the scaling relations followed by each galaxy type change very little with environment, with the exception of some minor but detectable effects. The shift in the population is apparent even at the densities of small groups and therefore cannot be exclusively due to physical processes operating in rich clusters. Third, we divide galaxies into four crude types---spiral, lenticular, elliptical, and merging systems---and describe some of their more detailed properties. We attempt to put these detailed properties into the global context provided by large surveys. },

	Abstract = {Within the Local Universe galaxies can be studied in great detail star by star, and here we review the results of quantitative studies in nearby dwarf galaxies. The color-magnitude diagram synthesis method is well established as the most accurate way to determine star-formation histories of galaxies back to the earliest times. This approach received a large boost from the exceptional data sets that wide-field CCD imagers on the ground and the Hubble Space Telescope could provide. Spectroscopic studies using large ground-based telescopes such as VLT, Magellan, Keck, and HET have allowed the determination of abundances and kinematics for significant samples of stars in nearby dwarf galaxies. These studies have shown how the properties of stellar populations can vary spatially and temporally. This leads to important constraints to theories of galaxy formation and evolution. The combination of spectroscopy and imaging and what they have taught us about dwarf galaxy formation and evolution is the aim of this review. },

	Abstract = {Large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules carry the infrared (IR) emission features that dominate the spectra of most galactic and extragalactic sources. This review surveys the observed mid-IR characteristics of these emission features and summarizes laboratory and theoretical studies of the spectral characteristics of PAHs and the derived intrinsic properties of emitting interstellar PAHs. Dedicated experimental studies have provided critical input for detailed astronomical models that probe the origin and evolution of interstellar PAHs and their role in the universe. The physics and chemistry of PAHs are discussed, emphasizing the contribution of these species to the photoelectric heating and the ionization balance of the interstellar gas and to the formation of small hydrocarbon radicals and carbon chains. Together, these studies demonstrate that PAHs are abundant, ubiquitous, and a dominant force in the interstellar medium of galaxies. },

	Abstract = {I came to the attention of astronomers through inventing the low temperature bolometer at Texas Instruments. I was quickly drawn into pioneering infrared (IR) astronomy. I soon transferred to the National Radio Astronomy Observatory and then to the University of Arizona to make astronomy my focus. Parallel programs were getting under way at the California Institute of Technology, Cornell, the Universities of Minnesota and of California, San Diego. Although our methods were crude, discoveries were easy and exciting. I was involved in many of them because I could supply good detectors and invented a number of new techniques. Eventually, I supplied detector systems and instruments through founding of a small company. By the early 1970s, systematic IR astronomy was under way on many important problems that are still active research topics. This rapid success led to investments in large new telescopes and in the IRAS survey satellite. },

A variety of approaches are now used for detector arrays operating from 1 mum to 1 mm and beyond. They include direct hybrid arrays of InSb and HgCdTe photodiodes that operate from 0.6 mum to 5 mum, and of Si:As impurity band conduction detectors from 5 mum to 28 mum; a number of approaches to photoconductive detector arrays in the far-infrared; and bolometer arrays read out by transistors or superconducting devices in the far-infrared through millimeter-wave spectral range. The underlying principles behind these approaches are discussed. The application of these principles is illustrated through detailed discussion of a number of state-of-the-art detector arrays. },

	Abstract = {We present a sample of low-resolution 5-38 mum Spitzer IRS spectra of the inner few square kiloparsecs of 59 nearby galaxies spanning a large range of star formation properties. A robust method for decomposing mid-infrared galaxy spectra is described and used to explore the behavior of PAH emission and the prevalence of silicate dust extinction. Evidence for silicate extinction is found in ~1/8 of the sample, at strengths that indicate that most normal galaxies undergo A<SUB>V</SUB>&lt;~3 mag averaged over their centers. The contribution of PAH emission to the total infrared power is found to peak near 10% and extend up to ~20% and is suppressed at metallicities Z&lt;~Z<SUB>solar</SUB>/4, as well as in low-luminosity AGN environments. Strong interband PAH feature strength variations (2-5 times) are observed, with the presence of a weak AGN and, to a lesser degree, increasing metallicity shifting power to the longer wavelength bands. A peculiar PAH emission spectrum with markedly diminished 5-8 mum features arises among the sample solely in systems with relatively hard radiation fields harboring low-luminosity AGNs. The AGNs may modify the emitting grain distribution and provide the direct excitation source of the unusual PAH emission, which cautions against using absolute PAH strength to estimate star formation rates in systems harboring active nuclei. Alternatively, the low star formation intensity often associated with weak AGNs may affect the spectrum. The effect of variations in the mid-infrared spectrum on broadband infrared surveys is modeled and points to more than a factor of 2 uncertainty in results that assume a fixed PAH emission spectrum, for redshifts z=0-2.5. },

	Abstract = {We present ISOPHOT spectra of the regions 2.5-4.9 mum and 5.8-11.6 mum for a sample of 45 disk galaxies from the US Infrared Space Observatory Key Project on Normal Galaxies. The galaxies were selected to span the range in global properties of normal, star-forming disk galaxies in the local universe. The spectra can be decomposed into three spectral components: (1) continuum emission from stellar photospheres, which dominates the near-infrared (NIR; 2.5-4.9 mum) spectral region; (2) a weak NIR excess continuum, which has a color temperature of ~10<SUP>3</SUP> K, carries a luminosity of a few percent of the total far-infrared (FIR) dust luminosity L<SUB>FIR</SUB> and most likely arises from the interstellar medium (ISM); and (3) the well-known broad emission features at 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, and 11.3 mum, which are generally attributed to aromatic carbon particles. These aromatic features in emission (AFEs) dominate the mid-infrared (MIR; 5.8-11.6 mum) part of the spectrum and resemble the so-called type A spectra observed in many nonstellar sources and the diffuse ISM in our own Galaxy. The few notable exceptions include NGC 4418, where a dust continuum replaces the AFEs in MIR, and NGC 1569, where the AFEs are weak and the strongest emission feature is [S IV] 10.51 mum. The relative strengths of the AFEs vary by 15%-25% among the galaxies. However, little correlation is seen between these variations and either IRAS 60 mum/100 mum flux density ratio R(60/100) or the FIR/blue luminosity ratio L<SUB>FIR</SUB>/L<SUB>B</SUB>, two widely used indicators of the current star formation activity, suggesting that the observed variations are not a consequence of the radiation field differences among the galaxies. We demonstrate that the NIR excess continuum and AFE emission are correlated, suggesting that they are produced by similar mechanisms and similar (or the same) material. On the other hand, as the current star formation activity increases, the overall strengths of the AFEs and the NIR excess continuum drop significantly with respect to that of the FIR emission from large dust grains. In particular, the summed luminosity of the AFEs falls from ~0.2 L<SUB>FIR</SUB> for the most ``IR-quiescent'' galaxies to ~0.1 L<SUB>FIR</SUB> for the most ``IR-active'' galaxies. This is likely a consequence of the preferential destruction in intense radiation fields of the small carriers responsible for the NIR/AFE emission.<p/>  Based on observations with ISO, an ESA project with instruments funded by ESA member states (especially the PI countries, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom) and with the participation of ISAS and NASA. },

SUNRISE, a Monte Carlo radiative transfer code, is used to make detailed calculations of the internal extinction of disc galaxies caused by their dust content.<p/>  SUNRISE is used on eight different smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of isolated spiral galaxies. These galaxies vary mainly in mass and hence luminosity, spanning a range in luminosities from -16 to -22 mag in the B band. We focus on the attenuation in different wavelength bands as a function of the disc inclination and the luminosity of the models, and compare this to observations.<p/>  Observations suggest different metallicity gradients for galaxies of different luminosities. These metallicity gradients were explored in our different models, finding that the resulting dust attenuation matches observations for edge-on galaxies, but does not show a linear behaviour in log(axialratio) as some observations have suggested. A quadratic law describing the dependence of attenuation on inclination, as proposed by more recent observations, reconciles the attenuation of the simulations at intermediate inclinations with observations. We also compare the total infrared-to-ultraviolet flux ratios for the simulated galaxies with those of the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey sample and find general agreement. Finally, we compare our results with those from simpler models that do not take into account structures such as spiral arms, finding that the inclusion of substructures on the size scale of spiral arms does not change conclusions about the attenuation dependence on inclination or wavelength. },

A digression is devoted to starbursts in view of their potential relevance for measures of opacity in distant galaxies. Scarcity of coherent multiwavelength data sets hampers our ability to derive reliable obscuration estimates in intermediate- and high-redshift galaxies. This, in turn, limits the reliability of inferred physical quantities, such as star formation rates, stellar population ages, galaxy luminosity functions, and others. },

	Abstract = {The treatment of dust attenuation is crucial in order to compare the predictions of galaxy formation models with multiwavelength observations. Most past studies have used either simple analytic prescriptions or full radiative transfer (RT) calculations. Here, we couple star formation histories and morphologies predicted by the semi-analytic galaxy formation model MORGANA with RT calculations from the spectrophotometric and dust code GRASIL to create a library of galaxy spectral energy distributions from the UV/optical through the far-infrared, and compare the predictions of the RT calculations with analytic prescriptions. We consider a low- and high-redshift sample, as well as an additional library constructed with empirical, non-cosmological star formation histories and simple (pure bulge or disc) morphologies. Based on these libraries, we derive fitting formulae for the effective dust optical depth as a function of galaxy physical properties such as metallicity, gas mass and radius. We show that such fitting formulae can predict the V-band optical depth with a scatter smaller than 0.4 dex for both the low- and high-redshift samples, but there is a large galaxy-to-galaxy scatter in the shapes of attenuation curves, probably due to geometrical variations, which our simple recipe does not capture well. However, our new recipe provides a better approximation to the GRASIL results at optical wavelength than standard analytic prescriptions from the literature, particularly at high redshift. },

	Abstract = {We use a combination of three-dimensional Monte Carlo radiative transfer techniques and multiwavelength (BRHK, Halpha) imaging data to investigate the nature of the interstellar medium (ISM) in the edge-on, low surface brightness (LSB) galaxy UGC 7321. Using realistic models that incorporate multiple scattering effects and clumping of the stars and the interstellar material, we explore the distribution and opacity of the interstellar material (gas+dust) and its effects on the observed stellar disk luminosity profiles, color gradients, and rotation curve shape. We find that UGC 7321 contains a small but nonnegligible dusty component to its ISM, yielding a B-band optical depth tau<SUB>e,B</SUB>~4.0 from disk edge to center. A significant fraction (~50%+/-10%) of the interstellar material in the innermost regions of UGC 7321 appears to be contained in a clumpy medium, indicating that LSB galaxies can support a modest, multiphase ISM structure. In spite of the clear presence of dust, we conclude that the large radial optical color gradients observed in UGC 7321 and other similar LSB spiral galaxies cannot be accounted for by dust and must result primarily from significant stellar population and/or metallicity gradients. We show that realistic optical depth effects will have little impact on the observed rotation curves of edge-on disk galaxies and cannot explain the linear, slowly rising rotation curves seen in some edge-on LSB spirals. Projection effects create a far larger uncertainty in recovering the true underlying rotation curve shape of galaxies viewed at inclinations i&gt;~85<SUP>deg</SUP>. },

	Abstract = {Deep J, H, and K' images, recorded with the ALTAIR adaptive optics system and NIRI imager on Gemini North, are used to probe the stellar content of the disk and bulge of the Local Group galaxy M31. With an FWHM near 0.08" in K, these are the highest angular resolution near-infrared images yet obtained of this galaxy. One field samples the outer disk of M31 at a galactocentric distance of roughly 62' along the major axis. The mean metallicity in this field is close to that of the metal-rich globular cluster NGC 6528, and no stars with [Fe/H]&lt;-0.7 are detected. Another field, located on the major axis 9' from the galaxy center, contains a roughly equal mix of disk and bulge stars. The red giant branch (RGB) in this field is redder than that of NGC 6528, although it is argued that reddening internal to M31 may be significant in this region of the galaxy. The remaining two fields, located at projected galactocentric distances of 2' and 4', are dominated by bulge stars. The RGB tip occurs between K=17.0 and 17.2, and the color of the RGB in the field closest to the center of M31 is consistent with that of NGC 6528. After accounting for random photometric errors, the upper RGB in each field has a width on the (K, J-K) color-magnitude diagrams that is consistent with a +/-0.5 dex dispersion in [Fe/H], in rough agreement with what is seen in other disk and spheroid fields in M31. The number of bright asymptotic giant branch (AGB) and RGB stars also scales with the r-band surface brightness in all four fields. Thus, we conclude that the stellar content does not change markedly from field to field and that the photometric properties of the brightest AGB stars in the two innermost fields are not affected significantly by crowding. The brightest star has M<SUB>K</SUB>=-8.6 and M<SUB>bol</SUB>=-5.2, although this may not be a reliable measure of the AGB-tip brightness because of photometric variability. A population of very bright red stars, which we identify as C stars, are seen in the three fields that are closest to the center of M31. The spatial distribution of these objects suggest that they are well mixed throughout this part of M31, and thus they likely did not form in a compact region near the galactic nucleus but more probably in the inner disk. We speculate that these C stars may be the most luminous members of the intermediate-age population that has been detected previously in studies of the integrated spectrum of the central regions of M31.<p/>  Based on observations obtained at the Gemini Observatory, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under a cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation (NSF) on behalf of the Gemini partnership: the NSF (United States), the Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council (United Kingdom), the National Research Council of Canada (Canada), CONICYT (Chile), the Australian Research Council (Australia), CNPq (Brazil), and CONICET (Argentina). },

@article{Davidge:2000,
	Abstract = {Near-infrared images obtained with the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) Adaptive Optics Bonnette (AOB) are used to investigate the stellar content of the Local Group compact elliptical galaxy M32. Observations of a field 2.3' from the galaxy center reveal a large population of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, and comparisons with models indicate that these objects have an age log(t<SUB>Gyr</SUB>)&lt;=9.3. The AGB population is very homogeneous, with Deltalog(t<SUB>Gyr</SUB>)&lt;=+/-0.1 dex and Delta[M/H]&lt;=+/-0.3 dex. The reddest AGB stars have J-K&lt;=1.5, and it is suggested that the very red stars seen in earlier, less deep, surveys are the result of large photometric errors. The bolometric AGB luminosity function (LF) of this field is in excellent agreement with that of the Galactic bulge. Based on the integrated brightness of AGB stars brighter than the red giant branch tip, which occurs at K=17.8, it is concluded that intermediate-age stars account for roughly 25% of the total K light and 10%+/-5% of the total mass in this field. A field close to the center of M32 was also observed. The brightest stars within a few arcseconds of the nucleus have K=15.5, and the density of these objects is consistent with that predicted from the outer regions of the galaxy after scaling according to surface brightness. Moreover, the K luminosity function (LF) of bright sources between 20" and 30" of the nucleus is well matched by the LF of the outer regions of the galaxy after accounting for differences in surface brightness and correcting for the effects of crowding. It is concluded that the relative size of the intermediate-age component with respect to other populations does not change with radius over much of the galaxy. However, the integrated J-K color and 2.3 mum CO index change with radius within a few tenths of an arcsecond of the galaxy center, indicating that, contrary to what might be inferred from observations at visible wavelengths, the integrated photometric properties of the central regions of M32 differ from those of the surrounding galaxy. },

	Abstract = {Surface brightness fluctuations (SBFs) have been proved to be a very powerful technique to determine the distance and characterize the stellar content in extragalactic systems. Nevertheless, before facing the problem of stellar content in distant galaxies, we need to calibrate the method onto nearby well known systems. In this paper we analyze the properties at the J and K<SUB>s</SUB> bands of a sample of 19 star clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud, for which accurate near-infrared (NIR) resolved star photometry and integrated photometry are available. For the same sample, we derive the SBF measurements in the J and K<SUB>s</SUB> bands. We use the multipurpose stellar population code SPoT (Stellar POpulations Tools) to simulate the color-magnitude diagram, stellar counts, integrated magnitudes, colors, and SBFs of each cluster. The present procedure allows us to estimate the age and metallicity of the clusters in a consistent way, and provides a new calibration of the empirical s-parameter. We take advantage of the high sensitivity of NIR SBFs to thermally pulsing asymptotic (TP-AGB) stars to test different mass-loss rates affecting the evolution of such stars. We argue that NIR-SBFs can contribute to the disentangling of the observable properties of TP-AGB stars, especially in galaxies, where a large number of these stars are present. },

	Abstract = {The Spitzer Space Telescope was used to study the mid- to far-infrared properties of NGC 300 and to compare dust emission to Halpha to elucidate the heating of the interstellar medium (ISM) and the star formation cycle at scales smaller than 100 pc. The new data allow us to discern clear differences in the spatial distribution of 8 mum dust emission with respect to 24 mum dust and to H II regions traced by Halpha light. The 8 mum emission highlights the rims of H II regions, and the 24 mum emission is more strongly peaked in star-forming regions than 8 mum. We confirm the existence and approximate amplitude of interstellar dust emission at 4.5 mum, detected statistically in Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) data, and conclude it arises in star-forming regions. When averaging over regions larger than ~1 kpc, the ratio of Halpha to aromatic feature emission in NGC 300 is consistent with the values observed in disks of spiral galaxies. The mid- to far-infrared spectral energy distribution of dust emission is generally consistent with pre-Spitzer models. },

	Abstract = {We present an exhaustive quantitative comparison of all the known extinction curves in the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds (SMC and LMC) with our understanding of the general behavior of Milky Way extinction curves. The R<SUB>V</SUB>-dependent CCM relationship of Cardelli, Clayton, and Mathis and the sample of extinction curves used to derive this relationship are used to describe the general behavior of Milky Way extinction curves. The ultraviolet portion of the SMC and LMC extinction curves are derived from archival IUE data, except for one new SMC extinction curve, which was measured using Hubble Space Telescope Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph observations. The optical extinction curves are derived from new (for the SMC) and literature UBVRI photometry (for the LMC). The near-infrared extinction curves are calculated mainly from 2MASS photometry supplemented with DENIS and new JHK photometry. For each extinction curve, we give R<SUB>V</SUB>=A(V)/E(B-V) and N(H I) values that probe the same dust column as the extinction curve. We compare the properties of the SMC and LMC extinction curves with the CCM relationship three different ways: each curve by itself, the behavior of extinction at different wavelengths with R<SUB>V</SUB>, and the behavior of the extinction curve Fitzpatrick and Massa fit parameters with R<SUB>V</SUB>. As has been found previously, we find that a small number of LMC extinction curves are consistent with the CCM relationship, but the majority of the LMC and all the SMC curves do not follow the CCM relationship. For the first time, we find that the CCM relationship seems to form a bound on the properties of all the LMC and SMC extinction curves. This result strengthens the picture dust extinction curves exhibit of a continuum of properties between those found in the Milky Way and the SMC bar. Tentative evidence based on the behavior of the extinction curves with dust-to-gas ratio suggests that the continuum of dust extinction curves is possibly caused by the environmental stresses of nearby star formation activity.<p/>  Partially based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555. These observations are associated with proposal 8198. },

	Abstract = {The observed anti-correlation between the inclination and the slope of the innermost part of the rotation curve can be attributed to dust extinction. However, the implied central face-on opacity of tau=2{-}4 for the most luminous galaxies is embarrassingly high compared with studies of edge-on galaxies, which yield central face-on opacities equal to at most tau=1 in the optical band. I show that the controversy can be resolved by adopting a model that includes the velocity dispersion of the emitters. Through the use of such a model, I reproduce the correlation between galaxy inclination and the slope of its inner rotation curve without having to resort to excessively high optical depth. },

	Abstract = {We present results from a new modelling technique which can account for the observed optical/NIR - FIR/submm spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of normal star-forming galaxies in terms of a minimum number of essential parameters specifying the star-formation history and geometrical distribution of stars and dust. The model utilises resolved optical/NIR images to constrain the old stellar population and associated dust, and geometry-sensitive colour information in the FIR/submm to constrain the spatial distributions of young stars and associated dust.  It is successfully applied to the edge-on spirals NGC891 and NGC5907. In both cases the young stellar population powers the bulk of the FIR/sub-mm emission. The model also accounts for the observed surface brightness distribution and large-scale radial brightness profiles in NGC891 as determined using the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) at 170 and 200 mcrions and at 850 micron using SCUBA. },

	Abstract = {Our GHOSTS survey measures the stellar envelope properties of 14 nearby disk galaxies by imaging their resolved stellar populations with HST/ACS&#38;WFPC2. Most of the massive galaxies in the sample (Vrot &gt;200 km/s) have very extended stellar envelopes with Sersic law profiles or mu(r)~r^-2.5 power law profiles in the outer regions. For these massive galaxies we can fit the central bulge light and the outer halo out to 30 kpc with one and the same Sersic profile and the stellar surface density of the profiles correlate with Hubble type and bulge- to-disk ratio. This suggests that the central bulges and inner halos are created in the same process. Smaller galaxies (Vrot ~100 km/s) have much smaller stellar envelopes, but depending on geometry, they could still be more luminous than expected from satellite remnants in hierarchical galaxy formation models. Alternatively, they could be created by disk heating through the bombardment of small dark matter sub-halos. The halos we fit are highly flattened, with minor- over-ma jor axis ratios c/a=0.6. The halos are somewhat more compact than hierarchical model predictions. The halos show small metallicity gradient out to 30 kpc and the massive galaxies have typical [Fe/H]~-0.8. We find indications of halo substructure in many galaxies, but some halos seem remarkable smooth.},

	Abstract = {We decompose the rotation curves of 34 bright spiral galaxies into baryonic and dark matter components. Stellar mass profiles are created by applying color-M/L relations to near-infrared and optical photometry. We find that the radial profile of the baryonic-to-dark-matter ratio is self-similar for all galaxies, when scaled to the radius at which the contribution of the baryonic mass to the rotation curve equals that of the dark matter (R<SUB>X</SUB>). We argue that this is due to the quasi-exponential nature of disks and rotation curves that are nearly flat after an initial rise. The radius R<SUB>X</SUB> is found to correlate most strongly with baryonic rotation speed, such that galaxies with R<SUB>X</SUB> measurements that lie further out in their disks rotate faster. This quantity also correlates very strongly with stellar mass, Hubble type, and observed rotation speed; B-band central surface brightness is less related to R<SUB>X</SUB> than these other galaxy properties. Most of the galaxies in our sample appear to be close to maximal disk. For these galaxies, we find that maximum observed rotation speeds are tightly correlated with maximum rotation speeds predicted from the baryon distributions, such that one can create a Tully-Fisher relation based on surface photometry and redshifts alone. Finally, we compare our data to the NFW parameterization for dark matter profiles with and without including adiabatic contraction as it is most commonly implemented. Fits are generally poor, and all but two galaxies are better fit if adiabatic contraction is not performed. In order to have better fits, and especially to accommodate adiabatic contraction, baryons would need to contribute very little to the total mass in the inner parts of galaxies, seemingly in contrast with other observational constraints.},

	Abstract = {We have used a large sample of low-inclination spiral galaxies with radially resolved optical and near-infrared photometry to investigate trends in star formation history with radius as a function of galaxy structural parameters. A maximum-likelihood method was used to match all the available photometry of our sample to the colours predicted by stellar population synthesis models. The use of simplistic star formation histories, uncertainties in the stellar population models and considering the importance of dust all compromise the absolute ages and metallicities derived in this work; however, our conclusions are robust in a relative sense. We find that most spiral galaxies have stellar population gradients, in the sense that their inner regions are older and more metal rich than their outer regions. Our main conclusion is that the surface density of a galaxy drives its star formation history, perhaps through a local density dependence in the star formation law. The mass of a galaxy is a less important parameter; the age of a galaxy is relatively unaffected by its mass; however, the metallicity of galaxies depends on both surface density and mass. This suggests that galaxy-mass-dependent feedback is an important process in the chemical evolution of galaxies. In addition, there is significant cosmic scatter suggesting that mass and density may not be the only parameters affecting the star formation history of a galaxy.},

@article{Bell:2001,
	Abstract = {We have used a suite of simplified spectrophotometric spiral galaxy evolution models to argue that there are substantial variations in stellar mass-to-light (M/L) ratios within and among galaxies, amounting to factors of between 3 and 7 in the optical and factors of 2 in the near-infrared. Our models show a strong correlation between stellar M/L and the optical colors of the integrated stellar populations. Under the assumption of a universal spiral galaxy initial mass function (IMF), relative trends in model stellar M/L with color are robust to uncertainties in stellar population and galaxy evolution modeling, including the effects of modest bursts of star formation. Errors in the dust-reddening estimates do not strongly affect the final derived stellar masses of a stellar population. We examine the observed maximum disk stellar M/L ratios of a sample of spiral galaxies with accurate rotation curves and optical and near-infrared luminosity profiles. From these observed maximum disk M/L ratios we conclude that a Salpeter IMF has too many low-mass stars per unit luminosity but that an IMF similar to the Salpeter IMF at the high-mass end with less low-mass stars (giving stellar M/L ratios 30% lower than the Salpeter value) is consistent with the maximum disk constraints. Trends in observed maximum disk stellar M/L ratios with color provide a good match to the predicted model relation, suggesting that the spiral galaxy stellar IMF is universal and that a fraction of (particularly high surface brightness) spiral galaxies may be close to maximum disk. We apply the model trends in stellar M/L ratio with color to the Tully-Fisher (T-F) relation. We find that the stellar mass T-F relation is relatively steep, has modest scatter, and is independent of the passband and color used to derive the stellar masses, again lending support for a universal IMF. The difference in slope between the optical (especially blue) and near-infrared T-F relations is due to the combined effects of dust attenuation and stellar M/L variations with galaxy mass. Assuming the Hubble Space Telescope Key Project distance to the Ursa Major Cluster and neglecting the (uncertain) molecular gas fraction, we find that the baryonic T-F relation takes the form M<SUB>baryon</SUB>~V<SUP>3.5</SUP> (with random and systematic 1 sigma slope errors of ~0.2 each) when using a bisector fit and rotation velocities derived from the flat part of the rotation curve. Since we have normalized the stellar M/L ratios to be as high as can possibly be allowed by maximum disk constraints, the slope of the baryonic T-F relation will be somewhat shallower than 3.5 if all disks are substantially submaximal.},

One can accurately determine the height distribution of stars and interstellar medium (ISM) and the line-of-sight integration allows for the study of faint structures. The Spitzer/IRAC camera is an ideal instrument to study both the ISM and stellar structure in nearby galaxies; two of its channels trace the old stellar disk with little extinction and the 8 mum channel is dominated by the smallest dust grains (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PAHs).<p/>  te{Dalcanton04} probed the link between the appearance of dust lanes and the disk stability. In a sample of bulge-less disks they show how in massive disks the ISM collapses into the characteristic thin dust lane. Less massive disks are gravitationally stable and their dust morphology is fractured. The transition occurs at 120 km s^{-1} for bulgeless disks.<p/>  Here we report on our results of our Spitzer/IRAC survey of nearby edge-on spirals and its first results on the NIR Tully-Fisher relation, and ISM disk stability.},

@article{Dalcanton:2004,
	Abstract = {From a survey of edge-on disks, we find that disk galaxies show a sharp, mass-dependent transition in the structure of their dusty ISM. In more massive, rapidly rotating disks with V<SUB>c</SUB>&gt;120kms<SUP>-1</SUP>, we see the well-defined dust lanes traditionally associated with edge-on galaxies. However, in more slowly rotating, lower mass galaxies with V<SUB>c</SUB>&lt;120kms<SUP>-1</SUP>, we find no dust lanes. Instead, the distribution of dust in these galaxies has a much larger scale height and thus appears more diffuse. Evidence suggests that the change in scale height is due primarily to changes in the turbulent velocities supporting the gas layer rather than to sharp changes in the gas surface density. A detailed analysis of our sample reveals that the decrease in the dust scale height is associated with the onset of disk instabilities, evaluated for a mixed star+gas disk. Specifically, we find that all of the high-mass galaxies with dust lanes are gravitationally unstable and thus are prone to fragmentation and gravitational collapse along spiral arms. Empirically, our data imply that turbulence has lower characteristic velocities in the presence of disk instabilities, leading to smaller gas scale heights and the appearance of narrow dust lanes. The drop in velocity dispersion may be due either to a switch in the driving mechanism for turbulence from supernovae to gravitational instabilities or to a change in the response of the ISM to supernovae after the ISM has collapsed to a dense layer. We hypothesize that the drop in gas scale height may lead to significant increases in the star formation rate when disk instabilities are present. First, the collapse of the gas layer increases the typical gas density, reducing the star formation timescale. Second, the star formation efficiency increases because of lower turbulent velocities. These two effects can combine to produce a sharp increase in the star formation rate with little change in the gas surface density and may therefore provide an explanation for the Kennicutt surface density threshold for star formation. Our data also suggest that star formation will be systematically less efficient in low-mass disks with V<SUB>c</SUB>&lt;120kms<SUP>-1</SUP>, since these galaxies are stable and lie entirely below the Kennicutt surface density threshold. In these stable systems the effective nucleosynthetic yield is reduced because the star formation timescale becomes longer than the gas accretion timescale, suppressing the metallicity. This effect can possibly produce the observed fall-off in metallicity at rotation speeds V<SUB>c</SUB>&lt;120kms<SUP>-1</SUP>. Thus, infall provides an equally plausible explanation of the mass-metallicity relation in disks as global outflows driven by supernova winds. The transitions in disk stability, dust structure, and/or star formation efficiency may also be responsible for the observed changes in the slope of the Tully-Fisher relation, in the sharp increase in the thickness of low-mass galaxy disks, and in the onset of bulges in galaxies with V<SUB>c</SUB>&gt;~120kms<SUP>-1</SUP>. The latter observation lends support to theories in which bulges in late-type galaxies grow through secular evolution in response to disk instabilities. We include in this paper relationships between the surface density and the vertical stellar velocity dispersion as a function of galaxy rotation speed, which may be useful constraints on galaxy formation models.},

	Abstract = {We present results of new Monte Carlo calculations made with the DIRTY code of radiative transfer of stellar and scattered radiation for a dusty giant late-type galaxy like the Milky Way, which illustrate the effect of the attenuation of stellar light by internal dust on the integrated photometry of the individual bulge and disk components. Here we focus on the behavior of the attenuation function, the color excess, and the fraction of light scattered or directly transmitted toward the outside observer as a function of the total amount of dust and the inclination of the galaxy, and the structure of the dusty interstellar medium (ISM) of the disk. We confirm that dust attenuation produces qualitatively and quantitatively different effects on the integrated photometry of bulge and disk, whatever the wavelength. In addition, we find that the structure of the dusty ISM affects more sensitively the observed magnitudes than the observed colors of both bulge and disk. Finally, we show that the contribution of the scattered radiation to the total monochromatic light received by the outside observer is significant, particularly at UV wavelengths, even for a two-phase, clumpy, dusty ISM. Thus, understanding dust scattering properties is fundamental for the interpretation of extragalactic observations in the rest-frame UV.},

	Abstract = {We present corrections for the change in the apparent scalelengths, central surface brightnesses and axis ratios due to the presence of dust in pure disk galaxies, as a function of inclination, central face-on opacity in the B-band (tau^f<SUB>B</SUB>) and wavelength. The correction factors were derived from simulated images of disk galaxies created using geometries for stars and dust which can reproduce the entire spectral energy distribution from the ultraviolet (UV) to the Far-infrared (FIR)/submillimeter (submm) and can also account for the observed surface-brightness distributions in both the optical/Near-infrared and FIR/submm. We found that dust can significantly affect both the scalelength and central surface brightness, inducing variations in the apparent to intrinsic quantities of up to 50% in scalelength and up to 1.5 mag in central surface brightness. We also identified some astrophysical effects for which, although the absolute effect of dust is non-negligible, the predicted variation over a likely range in opacity is relatively small, such that an exact knowledge of opacity is not needed. Thus, for a galaxy at a typical inclination of 37&deg; and having any tau^f<SUB>B</SUB>&gt;2, the effect of dust is to increase the scalelength in B relative to that in I by a factor of 1.12 &#177; 0.02 and to change the B-I central colour by 0.36&#177; 0.05 mag. Finally we use the model to analyse the observed scalelength ratios between B and I for a sample of disk-dominated spiral galaxies, finding that the tendency for apparent scalelength to increase with decreasing wavelength is primarily due to the effects of dust.},

	Abstract = {Context: The halo of NGC 891 has been the subject of studies for more than a decade. One of its most striking features is the large asymmetry in Halpha emission. In this letter, we will take a quantitative look at this asymmetry at different wavelengths for the first time.   Aims: We suggest that NGC 891 is intrinsically almost symmetric and the large asymmetry in Halpha emission is mostly due to dust attenuation. We will quantify the additional optical depth needed to cause the observed asymmetry in this model.  Methods: By comparing large strips on the North East side of the galaxy with strips covering the same area in the South West we can quantify and analyze the asymmetry in the different wavelengths.  Results: From the 24 mum emission we find that the intrinsic asymmetry in star formation in NGC 891 is small i.e., ~ 30%. The additional asymmetry in Halpha is modeled as additional symmetric dust attenuation which extends up to ~40&#180;&#180; (1.9 kpc) above the plane of the galaxy with a mid-plane value of tau = 0.8 and a scale height of 0.5 kpc},

The dust surface density is mainly a function of the total (atomic and molecular) gas surface density and galactocentric radius. The gas-to-dust ratio monotonically increases with radius, varying from ~100 in the nucleus to ~400 at 5.5 kpc. The slope of the gas-to-dust ratio is close to that of the oxygen abundance, suggesting that metallicity strongly affects the gas-to-dust ratio within this galaxy. The exponential scale length of the radial profile for the CO J=(3-2) emission is statistically identical to the scale length for the stellar continuum-subtracted 8 micron (PAH 8 micron) emission. However, CO J=(3-2) and PAH 8 micron surface brightnesses appear uncorrelated when examining sub-kpc sized regions.},

	Abstract = {We compare B, V, I, J, K surface photometry of the edge-on spiral galaxy NGC 891 with corresponding surface photometry calculated from a realistic model of spiral galaxies, taking into account both absorption and scattering by dust. For the stars and the dust in the disk, we use exponential distributions in both directions, radially and perpendicular to the plane of the disk. For the bulge we use the emissivity distribution given by the Hubble profile. Apart from the exponential main stellar disk, it was found necessary to include also a second stellar disk, describing the young stellar population in this galaxy. This disk has a scaleheight about three times less than that of the main disk and its emissivity is constant in the radial direction with a cut off at the visual end of the galaxy. The young stars are detected only in the B and V bands, indicating that in these bands they contribute significantly to the light near the major axis. For this galaxy we have found a face-on central optical depth of less than one in all bands, indicating that if the galaxy were seen face-on, it would be transparent in the optical and near infrared region of the spectrum. The total dust mass is calculated from the model parameters and the gas to dust ratio is found to be very similar to that of our Galaxy. The ratios A_lambda/A_V of the extinction values are computed for the five bands and compare quite well with the values given for our Galaxy.},

	Abstract = {We present a simple, largely empirical but physically motivated model to interpret the mid- and far-infrared spectral energy distributions of galaxies consistently with the emission at ultraviolet, optical and near-infrared wavelengths. Our model relies on an existing angle-averaged prescription to compute the absorption of starlight by dust in stellar birth clouds and in the ambient interstellar medium (ISM) in galaxies. We compute the spectral energy distribution of the power reradiated by dust in stellar birth clouds as the sum of three components: a component of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs); a mid-infrared continuum characterizing the emission from hot grains at temperatures in the range 130-250 K; and a component of grains in thermal equilibrium with adjustable temperature in the range 30-60 K. In the ambient ISM, we fix for simplicity the relative proportions of these three components to reproduce the spectral shape of diffuse cirrus emission in the Milky Way, and we include a component of cold grains in thermal equilibrium with adjustable temperature in the range 15-25 K. Our model is both simple and versatile enough that it can be used to derive statistical constraints on the star formation histories and dust contents of large samples of galaxies using a wide range of ultraviolet, optical and infrared observations. We illustrate this by deriving median likelihood estimates of the star formation rates, stellar masses, effective dust optical depths, dust masses and relative strengths of different dust components of 66 well-studied nearby star-forming galaxies from the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxy Survey (SINGS). We explore how the constraints derived in this way depend on the available spectral information. From our analysis of the SINGS sample, we conclude that the mid- and far-infrared colours of galaxies correlate strongly with the specific star formation rate, as well as with other galaxy-wide quantities connected to this parameter, such as the ratio of infrared luminosity between stellar birth clouds and the ambient ISM, the contributions by PAHs and grains in thermal equilibrium to the total infrared emission, and the ratio of dust mass to stellar mass. Our model can be straightforwardly applied to interpret ultraviolet, optical and infrared spectral energy distributions from any galaxy sample.},

@article{Charlot:2000,
	Abstract = {We present a new model for computing the effects of dust on the integrated spectral properties of galaxies, based on an idealized description of the main features of the interstellar medium (ISM). The model includes the ionization of H II regions in the interiors of the dense clouds in which stars form and the influence of the finite lifetime of these clouds on the absorption of radiation. We compute the production of emission lines and the absorption of continuum radiation in the H II regions and the subsequent transfer of line and continuum radiation in the surrounding H I regions and the ambient ISM. This enables us to interpret simultaneously all the observations of an ultraviolet-selected sample of nearby starburst galaxies, including the ratio of far-infrared to ultraviolet luminosities, the ratio of Halpha to Hbeta luminosities, the Halpha equivalent width, and the ultraviolet spectral slope. We show that the finite lifetime of stellar birth clouds is a key ingredient for resolving an apparent discrepancy between the attenuation of line and continuum photons in starburst galaxies. In addition, we find that an effective absorption curve proportional to lambda<SUP>-0.7</SUP> reproduces the observed relation between the ratio of far-infrared to ultraviolet luminosities and the ultraviolet spectral slope. We interpret this relation most simply as a sequence in the overall dust content of the galaxies. The shallow wavelength dependence of the effective absorption curve is compatible with the steepness of known extinction curves if the dust has a patchy distribution. In particular, we find that a random distribution of discrete clouds with optical depths similar to those in the Milky Way provides a consistent interpretation of all the observations. A noteworthy outcome of our detailed analysis is that the observed mean relations for starburst galaxies can be closely approximated by the following simple recipe: use an effective absorption curve proportional to lambda<SUP>-0.7</SUP> to attenuate the line and continuum radiation from each stellar generation, and lower the normalization of the curve, typically by a factor of 3 after 10<SUP>7</SUP> yr, to account for the dispersal of the birth clouds. This recipe or our full model for absorption can be incorporated easily into any population synthesis model.},

	Abstract = {To investigate the distribution of dust in Sb and Sc galaxies we have analyzed near-infrared and optical surface photometry for an unbiased sample of 37 galaxies. Since light in the K-band is very little affected by extinction by dust, the B - K colour is a good indicator of the amount of extinction, and using the colour-inclination relation we can statistically determine the extinction for an average Sb/Sc galaxy. We find in general a considerable amount of extinction in spiral galaxies in the central regions, all the way out to their effective radii. In the outer parts, at D_K,21_, or at 3 times the typical exponential scale lengths of the stellar distribution , we find a maximum optical depth of 0.5 in B for a face-on galaxy. If we impose the condition that the dust is distributed in the same way as the stars, this upper limit would go down to 0.1.},

	Abstract = {A spiral galaxy partially overlapping a more distant elliptical offers a unique opportunity to measure the dust extinction in the foreground spiral. From the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR4 spectroscopic sample, we selected 83 occulting galaxy pairs and measured disk opacity over the redshift range z = 0.0-0.2 with the goal of determining the recent evolution of disk dust opacity. The enrichment of the ISM changes over the lifetime of a disk, and it is reasonable to expect the dust extinction properties of spiral disks as a whole to change over their lifetime. When they do, the change will affect our measurements of galaxies over the observable universe. From the SDSS pairs we conclude that spiral disks show evidence of extinction to ~2 effective radii. However, no evidence for recent evolution of disk opacity is evident, due to the limited redshift range and our inability to distinguish other factors on disk opacity such as the presence of spiral arms and Hubble type. Such effects also mask any relation between surface brightness and optical depth that has been found in nearby galaxies. Hence, we conclude that the SDSS spectral catalog is an excellent way to find occulting pairs and construct a uniform local sample. However, a higher resolution than that of the SDSS images is needed to disentangle the effects of spiral arms and Hubble type from evolution since z = 0.2.},

	Abstract = {We describe the use of partially overlapping galaxies to provide direct measurements of the effective absorption in galaxy disks, independent of assumptions about internal disk structure. The nonoverlapping parts of the galaxies and symmetry considerations are used to reconstruct, via differential photometry, how much background galaxy light is lost in passing through the foreground disks. Extensive catalog searches and follow-up imaging yield ~15-25 nearby galaxy pairs suitable for varying degrees of our analysis; 11 of the best such examples are presented here. From these pairs, we find that interarm extinction is modest, declining from A<SUB>B</SUB>~1 mag at 0.3R<SUP>B</SUP><SUB>25</SUB> to essentially zero by R<SUP>B</SUP><SUB>25</SUB>; the interarm dust has a scale length consistent with that of the disk starlight. In contrast, dust in spiral arms and resonance rings may be optically thick (A<SUB>B</SUB>&gt;2) at virtually any radius. Some disks have flatter extinction curves than the Galaxy, with A<SUB>B</SUB>/A<SUB>I</SUB>~1.6 this is probably the signature of clumpy dust distributions. Even though typical spirals are not optically thick throughout their disks, where they are optically thick is correlated with where they are most luminous: in spiral arms and inner disks. This correlation between absorption and emission regions may account for their apparent surface brightness being only mildly dependent on inclination, erroneously indicating that spirals are generally optically thick. Taken as an ensemble, the opacities of spiral galaxies may be just great enough to significantly affect QSO counts, though not enough to cause their high-redshift cutoff. Based in part on archival observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope (HST) obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555.},

	Abstract = {We describe a new tool for the analysis of the UV to the sub-millimeter (sub-mm) spectral energy distribution (SED) of spiral galaxies. We use a consistent treatment of grain heating and emission, solve the radiation transfer problem for a finite disk and bulge, and self-consistently calculate the stochastic heating of grains placed in the resulting radiation field. We use this tool to analyse the well-studied nearby edge-on spiral galaxy NGC 891. First we investigate whether the old stellar population in NGC 891, along with a reasonable assumption about the young stellar population, can account for the heating of the dust and the observed far-infrared and sub-mm emission. The dust distribution is taken from the model of Xilouris et al. (1999), who used only optical and near-infrared observations to determine it. We have found that such a simple model cannot reproduce the SED of NGC 891, especially in the sub-mm range. It underestimates by a factor of 2-4 the observed sub-mm flux. A number of possible explanations exist for the missing sub-mm flux. We investigate a few of them and demonstrate that one can reproduce the observed SED in the far-infrared and the sub-mm quite well, as well as the observed radial profile at 850 mu m. For the models calculated we give the relative proportion of the dust radiation powered by the old and young stellar populations as a function of FIR/sub-mm wavelength. In all models we find that the dust is predominantly heated by the young stellar population.},

	Abstract = {Using tools previously described and applied to the prototype galaxy NGC 891, we model the optical to far-infrared spectral energy distributions (SED) of four additional edge-on spiral galaxies, namely NGC 5907, NGC 4013, UGC 1082 and UGC 2048. Comparing the model predictions with IRAS and, where available, sub-millimeter and millimeter observations, we determine the respective roles of the old and young stellar populations in grain heating. In all cases, the young population dominates, with the contribution of the old stellar population being at most 40%, as previously found for NGC 891. After normalization to the disk area, the massive star-formation rate (SFR) derived using our SED modeling technique, which is primarily sensitive to the non-ionizing ultraviolet output from the young stellar population, lies in the range 7*E<SUP>-4</SUP>-2*E<SUP>-2</SUP> { M}<SUB>sun</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>kpc<SUP>-2</SUP>. This is consistent with normalized SFRs derived for face-on galaxies of comparable surface gas densities from H<SUB>alpha </SUB> observations. Though the most active star-forming galaxy of the five in absolute terms, NGC 891 is not an exceptional system in terms of its surface density in SFR.},

	Abstract = {Magnitude-limited samples of spiral galaxies drawn from the Ursa Major and Pisces Clusters are used to determine their extinction properties as a function of inclination. Imaging photometry is available for 87 spirals in the B, R, I, and K' bands. Extinction causes systematic scatter in color-magnitude plots. A strong luminosity dependence is found. Relative edge-on to face-on extinction of up to 1.7 mag is found at B for the most luminous galaxies but is unmeasurably small for faint galaxies. At R the differential absorption with inclination reaches 1.3 mag, at I it reaches 1.0 mag, and at K' the differential absorption can in the extreme be as great as 0.3 mag. The luminosity dependence of reddening can be translated into a dependence on rotation rate, which is a distance-independent observable. Hence, corrections can be made that are useful for distance measurements. The strong dependence of the corrections on luminosity act to steepen luminosity-line width correlations. The effect is greatest toward the blue, with the consequence that luminosity-line width slope dependencies are now only weakly a function of color.},

Comparisons are also made with two related edge-on systems. The superthin galaxies are characterized by modest central velocity gradients, an underabundance of nitrogen, and very thin disks with little evidence of a central luminosity concentration. The mean H I content is roughly 10% of the estimated match, which is a value close to the mean for late-type Sd spirals, and large-scale galactic shocks may be nonexistent in the disks due to the modest central concentration of mass.},

	Abstract = {We use the tapering effect of Halpha/[N II] rotation curves of spiral galaxies first noted by Goad &#38; Roberts to investigate the internal extinction in disks. The scale length of exponential fits to the inner part of rotation curves depends strongly on the disk axial ratio. Preliminary modeling of the effect implies substantial opacity of the central parts of disks at a wavelength of 0.66 mum. In addition, the average kinematic scale length of rotation curves, when corrected to face-on perspective, has a nearly constant value of about 1.7 h<SUP>-1</SUP> kpc for all luminosity classes. The interpretation of that effect, as the result of the increasing dominance of the baryonic mass in the inner parts of galaxies, yields a mean baryonic mass-to-light ratio in the I band of Upsilon<SUB>I</SUB>=2.7 h M<SUB>solar</SUB>/L<SUB>solar,I</SUB>, within the inner 1.7 h<SUP>-1</SUP> kpc of disks.},

	Abstract = {The opacity of the disks of spiral galaxies can be evaluated by studying the gaseous component in edge-on galaxies in several wavelength regions. By combining data of the galaxy NGC 891 at 21 cm (H I), 2.6 mm (CO), and H-alpha, we show that the outer regions are transparent, while the inner regions, out to the radius to which CO is detected, could be optically thick. For the small galaxy NGC 100, such data indicate that this galaxy is by and large transparent, despite the presence of dust patches in the optical image. These results confirm the claim that spiral galaxies are transparent, at least in the outer parts, and clearly contradict the claim by Valentijn (1991) that the dark matter in spiral galaxies resides in the disk, in the form of absorbing clouds particularly abundant in the outer parts.},

	Abstract = {Observations show that the slope of the inner part of the Halpha/[N II] rotation curve of disk galaxies is depressed by extinction: at fixed luminosity, the observed slope is in fact seen to depend on the disk inclination to the line of sight. Using a simple extinction model, we are able to reproduce well the observed trends. The model assumes an exponential distribution, both in the radial and z directions, identical for star-forming regions and dust. Fits to the data are optimized by varying the scale height and scale length of absorbers, as well as the disk's central optical depth tau<SUB>0</SUB>, as seen face-on. The observations indicate that disk central opacity increases with total luminosity. Model fits for the most luminous galaxies (brighter than M-5logh=-21.4 in the I band) yield tau<SUB>0</SUB>~=3.5<SUP>+4.0</SUP><SUB>-2.0</SUB>, near lambda=0.66 mum. The large uncertainty on the inferred value of tau<SUB>0</SUB> is due to the poorly known characteristics of the distribution of absorbers in the disk, as well as to the likelihood of strong departures from an exponential radial distribution near the galaxy centers.},

An example is presented where substantial extinction of starlight occurs, but the extinction is mostly associated with the spiral features in which much of the light arises in the first place. It is suggested that this correlation of extinction with emission may account for both the transparency and apparent opacity of spiral galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We introduce a new technique based on artificial neural networks which enable us to make accurate predictions for the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of large samples of galaxies, at wavelengths ranging from the far-ultraviolet (UV) to the submillimetre (sub-mm) and radio. The neural net is trained to reproduce the SEDs predicted by a hybrid code comprised of the GALFORM semi-analytical model of galaxy formation, which predicts the full star formation and galaxy merger histories, and the GRASIL spectro-photometric code, which carries out a self-consistent calculation of the SED, including absorption and emission of radiation by dust. Using a small number of galaxy properties predicted by GALFORM, the method reproduces the luminosities of galaxies in the majority of cases to within 10 per cent of those computed directly using GRASIL. The method performs best in the sub-mm and reasonably well in the mid-infrared (IR) and far-UV. The luminosity error introduced by the method has negligible impact on predicted statistical distributions, such as luminosity functions or colour distributions of galaxies. We use the neural net to predict the overlap between galaxies selected in the rest-frame UV and in the observer-frame sub-mm at z = 2. We find that around half of the galaxies with a 850mum flux above 5 mJy should have optical magnitudes brighter than R<SUB>AB</SUB> &lt; 25 mag. However, only 1 per cent of the galaxies selected in the rest-frame UV down to R<SUB>AB</SUB> &lt; 25 mag should have 850mum fluxes brighter than 5 mJy. Our technique will allow the generation of wide-angle mock catalogues of galaxies selected at rest-frame UV or mid- and far-IR wavelengths.},

Starting from the work of Calura et al., in which chemical evolution models have been used to study the evolution of both the gas and dust components of the interstellar medium in the solar neighbourhood, elliptical and irregular galaxies, it has been possible to combine these models with a spectrophotometric stellar code that includes dust reprocessing (GRASIL) to analyse the evolution of the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of these galaxies. We test our models against observed SEDs both in the local universe and at high redshift, and use them to predict how the percentage of reprocessed starlight evolves for each type of galaxy. The importance of following the dust evolution is investigated by comparing our results with those obtained by adopting simple assumptions to treat this component.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes SUNRISE, a parallel, free Monte Carlo code for the calculation of radiation transfer through astronomical dust. SUNRISE uses an adaptive mesh refinement grid to describe arbitrary geometries of emitting and absorbing/scattering media, with spatial dynamical range exceeding 10<SUP>4</SUP>, and it can efficiently generate images of the emerging radiation at arbitrary points in space. In addition to the monochromatic radiative transfer typically used by Monte Carlo codes, SUNRISE is capable of propagating a range of wavelengths simultaneously. This `polychromatic' algorithm gives significant improvements in efficiency and accuracy when spectral features are calculated. SUNRISE is used to study the effects of dust in hydrodynamic simulations of interacting galaxies, and the procedure for this is described. The code is tested against previously published results.},

	Abstract = {We map the stellar structure of the Galaxy by applying color-magnitude diagram (CMD) fitting to photometric data from the SEGUE survey allowing, for the first time, a comprehensive analysis of Milky Way structure at both high and low latitudes using uniform SDSS photometry. The advantage of CMD fitting is that it incorporates photometry of all relevant stars simultaneously, bypassing the need to choose single tracer populations. Using three template stellar populations we obtain a sparse 3-D map of the stellar mass distribution. Fitting a smooth Milky Way model, comprised of exponential thin and thick disks and an axisymmetric power-law halo, allows us to constrain the structural parameters of the thick disk and halo. The thick disk scale height and length of such models are well constrained at 0.75+-0.07 kpc and 4.1+-0.4 kpc, respectively. We find a stellar halo flattening within ~25 kpc of c/a=0.88+-0.03 and a power-law index of 2.75+-0.07. The model fits yield densities at the solar location of rho_{thick,0}=10^{-2.3+-0.1} M_\sun pc^{-3} and rho_{halo,0}=10^{-4.20+-0.05} M_\sun pc^{-3}. We detect in-situ evidence for a metallicity gradient in the stellar halo: within R&lt;~15 kpc the stellar halo has a mean metallicity of [Fe/H]=-1.6, which shifts to [Fe/H]=-2.2 at larger radii. Subtraction of the best-fit smooth and symmetric model from the density maps reveals a wealth of substructures at all latitudes, some attributable to known streams and overdensities, and some new. A simple warp cannot account for the low latitude substructure, as overdensities occur simultaneously above and below the Galactic plane. (abridged)},

	Abstract = {Warm dark matter (WDM) and self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) are often motivated by the inferred cores in the dark matter halos of low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies. We test thermal WDM, non-thermal WDM, and SIDM using high-resolution rotation curves of nine LSB galaxies. We fit these dark matter models to the data and determine the halo core radii and central densities. While the minimum core size in WDM models is predicted to decrease with halo mass, we find that the inferred core radii increase with halo mass and also cannot be explained with a single value of the primordial phase-space density. Moreover, if the core size is set by WDM particle properties, then even the smallest cores we infer would require primordial phase-space density values that are orders of magnitude smaller than lower limits obtained from the Lyalpha forest power spectra. We also find that the dark matter halo core densities vary by a factor of about 30 from system to system while showing no systematic trend with the maximum rotation velocity of the galaxy. This strongly argues against the core size being directly set by large self-interactions (scattering or annihilation) of dark matter. We therefore conclude that the inferred cores do not provide motivation to prefer WDM or SIDM over other dark matter models.},

@article{Hogan:2000,
	Abstract = {We examine the effect of primordial dark matter velocity dispersion and/or particle self-interactions on the structure and stability of galaxy halos, especially with respect to the formation of substructure and central density cusps. Primordial velocity dispersion is characterized by a ``phase density'' Q&equiv;rho/&lt;v<SUP>2</SUP>&gt;<SUP>3/2</SUP>, which for relativistically decoupled relics is determined by particle mass and spin and is insensitive to cosmological parameters. Finite Q leads to small-scale filtering of the primordial power spectrum, which reduces substructure, and limits the maximum central density of halos, which eliminates central cusps. The relationship between Q and halo observables is estimated. The primordial Q may be preserved in the cores of halos and if so leads to a predicted relation, closely analogous to that in degenerate dwarf stars, between the central density and velocity dispersion. Classical polytrope solutions are used to model the structure of halos of collisional dark matter, and to show that self-interactions in halos today are probably not significant because they destabilize halo cores via heat conduction. Constraints on masses and self-interactions of dark matter particles are estimated from halo stability and other considerations.},

	Abstract = {We use the Ly-alpha forest power spectrum measured by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and high-resolution spectroscopy observations in combination with cosmic microwave background and galaxy clustering constraints to place limits on a sterile neutrino as a dark matter candidate in the warm dark matter scenario. Such a neutrino would be created in the early Universe through mixing with an active neutrino and would suppress structure on scales smaller than its free-streaming scale. We ran a series of high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations with varying neutrino masses to describe the effect of a sterile neutrino on the Ly-alpha forest power spectrum. We find that the mass limit is m<SUB>s</SUB>&gt;13keV at 95% C.L. (9 keV at 99.9%), which is above the upper limit allowed by x-ray constraints, excluding this candidate from being all of the dark matter in this model.},

@article{Biermann:2007,
	Abstract = {Dark matter has been recognized as an essential part of matter for over 70 years now, and many suggestions have been made, what it could be. Most of these ideas have centered on Cold Dark Matter, particles that are predicted in extensions of standard particle physics, such as supersymmetry. Here we explore the concept that dark matter is sterile neutrinos, particles that are commonly referred to as Warm Dark Matter. Such particles have keV masses, and decay over a very long time, much longer than the Hubble time. In their decay they produce X-ray photons which modify the ionization balance in the very early universe, increasing the fraction of molecular Hydrogen, and thus help early star formation. Sterile neutrinos may also help to understand the baryon-asymmetry, the pulsar kicks, the early growth of black holes, the minimum mass of dwarf spheroidal galaxies, as well as the shape and smoothness of dark matter halos. As soon as all these tests have been made quantitative in their various parameters, we may focus on the creation mechanism of these particles, and could predict the strength of the sharp X-ray emission line, expected from any large dark matter assembly. A measurement of this X-ray emission line would be definitive proof for the existence of may be called weakly interacting neutrinos, or WINs.},
