\&\*(L"Purifies\*(R" a \f(CW\*(C`string\*(C'\fR in the BibTeX way (usually used for generating
sort keys).  \f(CW\*(C`string\*(C'\fR is modified in\-place.  \f(CW\*(C`options\*(C'\fR is currently
unused; just set it to zero for future compatibility.  Purification
consists of copying alphanumeric characters, converting hyphens and ties
to space, copying spaces, and skipping (almost) everything else.
.Sp
\&\*(L"Almost\*(R" because \*(L"special characters\*(R" (used for accented and non-English
letters) are handled specially.  Recall that a BibTeX special character
is any brace-group that starts at brace-depth zero whose first character
is a backslash.  For instance, the string
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   {\efoo bar}Herr M\e"uller went from {P{\er r}erov} to {\eAA}rhus
.Ve
.Sp
contains two special characters: \f(CW"{\efoo bar}"\fR and \f(CW"\eAA"\fR.  Neither
the \f(CW\*(C`\e"u\*(C'\fR nor the \f(CW\*(C`\er r\*(C'\fR are special characters, because they are not
at the right brace depth.
.Sp
Special characters are handled as follows: if the control sequence (the
TeX command that follows the backslash) is recognized as one of LaTeX's
\&\*(L"foreign letters\*(R" (\f(CW\*(C`\eoe\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\eae\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\eo\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\el\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\eae\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\ess\*(C'\fR, plus
uppercase versions), then it is converted to a reasonable English
approximation by stripping the backslash and converting the second
character (if any) to lowercase; thus, \f(CW\*(C`{\eAA}\*(C'\fR in the above example
would become simply \f(CW\*(C`Aa\*(C'\fR.  All other control sequences in a special
character are stripped, as are all non-alphabetic characters.
.Sp
For example the above string, after \*(L"purification,\*(R" becomes
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   barHerr Muller went from Pr rerov to Aarhus
.Ve
.Sp
Obviously, something has gone wrong with the word \f(CW\*(C`P{\er r}erov\*(C'\fR (a town
in the Czech Republic).  The accented `r' should be a special character,
starting at brace-depth zero.  If the original string were instead
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   {\efoo bar}Herr M\e"uller went from P{\er r}erov to {\eAA}rhus
.Ve
.Sp
then the purified result would be more sensible:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   barHerr Muller went from Prerov to Aarhus
.Ve
.Sp
Note the use of a \*(L"nonsense\*(R" special character \f(CW\*(C`{\efoo bar}\*(C'\fR: this trick
is often used to put certain text in a string solely for generating sort
keys; the text is then ignored when the document is processed by TeX (as
long as \f(CW\*(C`\efoo\*(C'\fR is defined as a no-op TeX macro).  This assumes, of
course, that the output is eventually processed by TeX; if not, then
this trick will backfire on you.
.Sp
Also, \f(CW\*(C`bt_purify_string()\*(C'\fR is adequate for generating sort keys when
you want to sort according to English-language conventions.  To follow
the conventions of other languages, though, a more sophisticated
approach will be needed; hopefully, future versions of \fBbtparse\fR will
address this deficiency.
.IP "\fIbt_change_case()\fR" 4
.IX Item "bt_change_case()"
.Vb 1
\&   void bt_change_case (char transform, char * string, ushort options);
.Ve
.Sp
Converts a string to lowercase, uppercase, or \*(L"non\-book title
capitalization\*(R", with special attention paid to BibTeX special
characters and other brace\-groups.  The form of conversion is selected
by the single character \f(CW\*(C`transform\*(C'\fR: \f(CW'u'\fR to convert to uppercase,
\&\f(CW'l'\fR for lowercase, and \f(CW't'\fR for \*(L"title capitalization\*(R".  \f(CW\*(C`string\*(C'\fR
is modified in\-place, and \f(CW\*(C`options\*(C'\fR is currently unused; set it to zero
for future compatibility.
.Sp
Lowercase and uppercase conversion are obvious, with the proviso that
text in braces is treated differently (explained below).  Title
capitalization simply means that everything is converted to lowercase,
except the first letter of the first word, and words immediately
following a colon or sentence-ending punctuation.  For instance,
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   Flying Squirrels: Their Peculiar Habits. Part One
.Ve
.Sp
would be converted to
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   Flying squirrels: Their peculiar habits. Part one
.Ve
.Sp
Text within braces is handled as follows.  First, in a \*(L"special
character\*(R" (see above for definition), control sequences that constitute
one of LaTeX's non-English letters are converted appropriately\-\-\-e.g.,
when converting to lowercase, \f(CW\*(C`\eAE\*(C'\fR becomes \f(CW\*(C`\eae\*(C'\fR).  Any other control
sequence in a special character (including accents) is preserved, and
all text in a special character, regardless of depth and punctuation, is
converted to lowercase or uppercase.  (For \*(L"title capitalization,\*(R" all
text in a special character is converted to lowercase.)
.Sp
Brace groups that are not special characters are left completely
untouched: neither text nor control sequences within non-special
character braces are touched.
.Sp
For example, the string
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   A Guide to \eLaTeXe: Document Preparation ...
.Ve
.Sp
would, when \f(CW\*(C`transform\*(C'\fR is \f(CW't'\fR (title capitalization), be converted
to 
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   A guide to \elatexe: Document preparation ...
.Ve
.Sp
which is probably not the desired result.  A better attempt is
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   A Guide to {\eLaTeXe}: Document Preparation ...
.Ve
.Sp
which becomes 
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   A guide to {\eLaTeXe}: Document preparation ...
.Ve
.Sp
However, if you go back and re-read the description of
\&\f(CW\*(C`bt_purify_string()\*(C'\fR, you'll discover that \f(CW\*(C`{\eLaTeXe}\*(C'\fR here is a
special character, but not a non-English letter: thus, the control
sequence is stripped.  Thus, a sort key generated from this title would
be
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   A Guide to  Document Preparation
.Ve
.Sp
\&...oops!  The right solution (and this applies to any title with a TeX
command that becomes actual text) is to bury the control sequence at
brace-depth two:
