well in the range of ordinary radio pulsars, implying that a high
surface dipolar magnetic field is not necessarily required for
magnetar-like activity. The magnetar population may thus include objects
with a wider range of B-field strengths, ages, and evolutionary stages

 abstract = "{(abridged) PSR J1903+0327, a millisecond pulsar in an eccentric (e =
0.44) 95-day orbit with a (\~{} 1Msun) companion poses a challenge to our
understanding of stellar evolution in binary and multiple-star systems.
Here we describe optical and radio observations which rule out most of
the scenarios proposed to explain formation of this system. Radio timing
measurements of three post-Keplerian effects yield the most precise
measurement of the mass of a millisecond pulsar to date: 1.667 +/- 0.021
solar masses (99.7\% confidence limit) (...). Optical spectroscopy of a
proposed main sequence counterpart show that its orbital motion mirrors
the pulsar's 95-day orbit; being therefore its binary companion (...)
The optical detection also provides a measurement of the systemic radial
velocity of the binary; this and the proper motion measured from pulsar
timing allow the determination of the systemic 3-D velocity in the
Galaxy. We find that the system is always within 270 pc of the plane of
the Galaxy, but always more than 3 kpc away from the Galactic centre.
Thus an exchange interaction in a dense stellar environment (like a
globular cluster or the Galactic centre) is not likely to be the origin
of this system. We suggest that after the supernova that formed it, the
neutron star was in a tight orbit with a main-sequence star, the present
companion was a tertiary farther out. The neutron star then accreted
matter from its evolving inner MS companion, forming a millisecond
pulsar. The former donor star then disappears, either due to a chaotic
3-body interaction with the outer star (caused by the expansion of the
inner orbit that necessarily results from mass transfer), or in the case
of a very compact inner system, due to ablation/accretion by the newly
formed millisecond pulsar.

 abstract = "{The oblique geometry of pulsar wind termination shock ensures that the
Doppler beaming has a strong impact on the shock emission. We illustrate
this using recent relativistic MHD simulations of the Crab Nebula and
also show that the observed size, shape, and distance from the pulsar of
the Crab Nebula inner knot are consistent with its interpretation as a
Doppler-boosted emission from the termination shock. If the electrons
responsible for the synchrotron gamma-rays are accelerated only at the
termination shock then their short life-time ensures that these
gamma-rays originate close to the shock and are also strongly effected
by the Doppler beaming. As the result, bulk of the observed synchrotron
gamma-rays of the Crab Nebula around 100 MeV may come from its inner
knot. This hypothesis is consistent with the observed optical flux of
the inner knot provided its optical-gamma spectral index is the same as
the injection spectral index found in the Kennel {\amp} Coroniti model of
the nebula spectrum. The observed variability of synchrotron gamma-ray
emission can be caused by the instability of the termination shock
discovered in recent numerical simulations. Given the small size of the
knot, it is possible that the September 2010 gamma-ray flare of the Crab
Nebula also came from the knot, though the actual mechanism remains
unclear. The model predicts correlation of the temporal variability of
the synchrotron gamma-ray flux in the Fermi and AGILE windows with the
variability of the unpulsed optical flux from within 1 arcsec of the
Crab pulsar.

in our Universe, the composition and properties of which are still

objects can strongly constrain the neutron star matter equation of state

of neutron star masses, however, has hitherto been too narrow to rule
out many predictions of `exotic' non-nucleonic components. The Shapiro
delay is a general-relativistic increase in light travel time through
the curved space-time near a massive body. For highly inclined (nearly
edge-on) binary millisecond radio pulsar systems, this effect allows us
to infer the masses of both the neutron star and its binary companion to
high precision. Here we present radio timing observations of the binary
millisecond pulsar J1614-2230 that show a strong Shapiro delay
signature. We calculate the pulsar mass to be
(1.97+/-0.04)M_{solar}, which rules out almost all currently
proposed hyperon or boson condensate equations of state
(M_{solar}, solar mass). Quark matter can support a star this
massive only if the quarks are strongly interacting and are therefore
not `free' quarks.

J1614-2230 yielded a mass of 1.97 +/- 0.04 M\_sun, making it the most

an accompanying measurement of the stellar radius, it has a strong
impact on our understanding of nuclear matter, gamma-ray bursts, and the
generation of gravitational waves from coalescing neutron stars. This
single high mass value indicates that a transition to quark matter in
neutron-star cores can occur at densities comparable to the nuclear
saturation density only if the quarks are strongly interacting and are
color superconducting. We further show that a high maximum neutron-star
mass is required if short duration gamma-ray bursts are powered by
coalescing neutron stars and, therefore, this mechanism becomes viable
in the light of the recent measurement. Finally, we argue that the
low-frequency ({\lt}= 500 Hz) gravitational waves emitted during the
final stages of neutron-star coalescence encode the properties of the
equation of state because neutron stars consistent with this measurement
cannot be centrally condensed. This will facilitate the measurement of
the neutron star equation of state with Advanced LIGO/Virgo.

 abstract = "{We present an up-to-date, comprehensive summary of the rates for all
types of compact binary coalescence sources detectable by the initial
and advanced versions of the ground-based gravitational-wave detectors
LIGO and Virgo. Astrophysical estimates for compact-binary coalescence
rates depend on a number of assumptions and unknown model parameters and
are still uncertain. The most confident among these estimates are the
rate predictions for coalescing binary neutron stars which are based on
extrapolations from observed binary pulsars in our galaxy. These yield a
likely coalescence rate of 100 Myr^{‑1} per Milky Way
Equivalent Galaxy (MWEG), although the rate could plausibly range from 1
Myr^{‑1} MWEG^{‑1} to 1000
Myr^{‑1} MWEG^{‑1} (Kalogera et al 2004
Astrophys. J. 601 L179; Kalogera et al 2004 Astrophys. J. 614 L137
(erratum)). We convert coalescence rates into detection rates based on
data from the LIGO S5 and Virgo VSR2 science runs and projected
sensitivities for our advanced detectors. Using the detector
sensitivities derived from these data, we find a likely detection rate
of 0.02 per year for Initial LIGO-Virgo interferometers, with a
plausible range between 2 {\times} 10^{‑4} and 0.2 per
year. The likely binary neutron-star detection rate for the Advanced
LIGO-Virgo network increases to 40 events per year, with a range between
0.4 and 400 per year.

 abstract = "{We present a new model for the spectral evolution of Pulsar Wind Nebulae
inside Supernova Remnants. The model couples the long-term dynamics of
these systems, as derived in the 1-D approximation, with a 1-zone
description of the spectral evolution of the emitting plasma. Our goal
is to provide a simplified theoretical description that can be used as a
tool to put constraints on unknown properties of PWN-SNR systems: a
piece of work that is preliminary to any more accurate and sophisticated
modeling. In the present paper we apply the newly developed model to a
few objects of different ages and luminosities. We find that an
injection spectrum in the form of a broken-power law gives a
satisfactory description of the emission for all the systems we
consider. More surprisingly, we also find that the intrinsic spectral
break turns out to be at a similar energy for all sources, in spite of
the differences mentioned above. We discuss the implications of our
findings on the workings of pulsar magnetospheres, pair multiplicity and
on the particle acceleration mechanism(s) that might be at work at the
pulsar wind termination shock.

 abstract = "{The dramatic increase in the number of known gamma-ray pulsars since the
launch of the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (formerly GLAST) offers
the first opportunity to study a sizable population of these high-energy
objects. This catalog summarizes 46 high-confidence pulsed detections
using the first six months of data taken by the Large Area Telescope
(LAT), Fermi's main instrument. Sixteen previously unknown pulsars were
discovered by searching for pulsed signals at the positions of bright
gamma-ray sources seen with the LAT, or at the positions of objects
suspected to be neutron stars based on observations at other
wavelengths. The dimmest observed flux among these gamma-ray-selected
pulsars is 6.0 {\times} 10^{-8} ph cm^{-2}
s^{-1} (for E{\gt}100 MeV). Pulsed gamma-ray emission was
discovered from 24 known pulsars by using ephemerides (timing solutions)
derived from monitoring radio pulsars. Eight of these new gamma-ray
pulsars are millisecond pulsars. The dimmest observed flux among the
radio-selected pulsars is 1.4 {\times} 10^{-8} ph
cm^{-2} s^{-1} (for E{\gt}100 MeV). The
remaining six gamma-ray pulsars were known since the Compton Gamma Ray
Observatory mission, or before. The limiting flux for pulse detection is
non-uniform over the sky owing to different background levels,
especially near the Galactic plane. The pulsed energy spectra can be
described by a power law with an exponential cutoff, with cutoff
energies in the range \~{}1-5 GeV. The rotational energy-loss rate ({\.E})
of these neutron stars spans five decades, from \~{}3 {\times}
10^{33} erg s^{-1} to 5 {\times} 10^{38}
erg s^{-1}, and the apparent efficiencies for conversion
to gamma-ray emission range from \~{}0.1\% to \~{} unity, although distance
uncertainties complicate efficiency estimates. The pulse shapes show
substantial diversity, but roughly 75\% of the gamma-ray pulse profiles
have two peaks, separated by gsim0.2 of rotational phase. For most of
the pulsars, gamma-ray emission appears to come mainly from the outer
magnetosphere, while polar-cap emission remains plausible for a
remaining few. Spatial associations imply that many of these pulsars
power pulsar wind nebulae. Finally, these discoveries suggest that
gamma-ray-selected young pulsars are born at a rate comparable to that
of their radio-selected cousins and that the birthrate of all young
gamma-ray-detected pulsars is a substantial fraction of the expected
Galactic supernova rate.

 abstract = "{We report on {$\gamma$}-ray observations of the Crab Pulsar and Nebula
using 8 months of survey data with the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT).
The high quality light curve obtained using the ephemeris provided by
the Nan{\c c}ay and Jodrell Bank radio telescopes shows two main peaks
stable in phase with energy. The first {$\gamma$}-ray peak leads the radio
main pulse by (281 {\plusmn} 12 {\plusmn} 21) {$\mu$}s, giving new
constraints on the production site of non-thermal emission in pulsar
magnetospheres. The first uncertainty is due to {$\gamma$}-ray statistics,
and the second arises from the rotation parameters. The improved
sensitivity and the unprecedented statistics afforded by the LAT enable
precise measurement of the Crab Pulsar spectral parameters: cut-off
energy at E_{c} = (5.8 {\plusmn} 0.5 {\plusmn} 1.2) GeV, spectral
index of {$\Gamma$} = (1.97 {\plusmn} 0.02 {\plusmn} 0.06) and integral
photon flux above 100 MeV of (2.09 {\plusmn} 0.03 {\plusmn} 0.18) {\times}
10^{-6} cm^{-2} s^{-1}. The
first errors represent the statistical error on the fit parameters,
while the second ones are the systematic uncertainties. Pulsed
{$\gamma$}-ray photons are observed up to \~{} 20 GeV which precludes emission
near the stellar surface, below altitudes of around 4-5 stellar radii in
phase intervals encompassing the two main peaks. A detailed
phase-resolved spectral analysis is also performed: the hardest emission
from the Crab Pulsar comes from the bridge region between the two
{$\gamma$}-ray peaks while the softest comes from the falling edge of the
second peak. The spectrum of the nebula in the energy range 100 MeV-300
GeV is well described by the sum of two power laws of indices
{$\Gamma$}_{sync} = (3.99 {\plusmn} 0.12 {\plusmn} 0.08) and
{$\Gamma$}_{IC} = (1.64 {\plusmn} 0.05 {\plusmn} 0.07), corresponding
to the falling edge of the synchrotron and the rising edge of the
inverse Compton (IC) components, respectively. This latter, which links
up naturally with the spectral data points of Cherenkov experiments, is
well reproduced via IC scattering from standard magnetohydrodynamic
nebula models, and does not require any additional radiation mechanism.

alternative explanations assume a nearby electron source like a pulsar

electron flux measured by H.E.S.S. is consistent with the ATIC data
within statistical and systematic errors, the H.E.S.S. data exclude a
pronounced peak in the electron spectrum as suggested for interpretation
by ATIC. The H.E.S.S. data follow a power-law spectrum with spectral
index of 3.0{\plusmn}0.1(stat.){\plusmn} 0.3(syst.), which steepens at
about 1 TeV.

between the dark matter and pulsar hypotheses with considerably greater
than 5{$\sigma$} significance, even for conservative assumptions regarding
their performance. In addition, this feature provides an opportunity to
perform an absolute calibration of the energy scale of ground based,

pulsars and by annihilating or decaying dark matter in the context of
recent ATIC, PAMELA, Fermi, and HESS data. We review the flux from a
single pulsar and derive the flux from a distribution of pulsars. We
point out that the particle acceleration in the pulsar magnetosphere is
insufficient to explain the observed excess of electrons and positrons
with energy {\~E}1TeV and one has to take into account an additional
acceleration of electrons at the termination shock between the pulsar
and its wind nebula. We show that at energies less than a few hundred
GeV, the expected flux from a continuous distribution of pulsars
provides a good approximation to the expected flux from pulsars in the
Australia Telescope National Facility catalog. At higher energies, we
demonstrate that the electron/positron flux measured at the Earth will
be dominated by a few young nearby pulsars, and therefore the spectrum
would contain bumplike features. We argue that the presence of such
features at high energies would strongly suggest a pulsar origin of the
anomalous contribution to electron and positron fluxes. The absence of
features either points to a dark matter origin or constrains pulsar
models in such a way that the fluctuations are suppressed. Also we
derive that the features can be partially smeared due to spatial
variation of the energy losses during propagation.

discovery of an isotropic, hard gamma ray spectral feature at Fermi
would be strong evidence for dark matter and would disfavor
astrophysical sources such as pulsars. Substructure in the cosmic ray
spectra probes the spectroscopy of new TeV-mass particles. For example,
a preponderance of electrons in the final state can result from the
lightness of selectrons relative to squarks. Decaying dark matter acts
as a sparticle injector with an energy reach potentially higher than the
LHC. The resulting cosmic ray flux depends only on the values of the
weak and unification scales.

 abstract = "{The North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves
(NANOGrav) is a consortium of astronomers whose goal is the creation of
a galactic scale gravitational wave observatory sensitive to
gravitational waves in the nHz-microHz band. It is just one component of
an international collaboration involving similar organizations of
European and Australian astronomers who share the same goal.
Gravitational waves, a prediction of Einstein's general theory of
relativity, are a phenomenon of dynamical space-time generated by the
bulk motion of matter, and the dynamics of space-time itself. They are
detectable by the small disturbance they cause in the light travel time
between some light source and an observer. NANOGrav exploits radio
pulsars as both the light (radio) source and the clock against which the
light travel time is measured. In an array of radio pulsars
gravitational waves manifest themselves as correlated disturbances in
the pulse arrival times. The timing precision of today's best measured
pulsars is less than 100 ns. With improved instrumentation and
signal-to-noise it is widely believed that the next decade could see a
pulsar timing network of 100 pulsars each with better than 100 ns timing
precision. Such a pulsar timing array (PTA), observed with a regular
cadence of days to weeks, would be capable of observing supermassive
black hole binaries following galactic mergers, relic radiation from
early universe phenomena such as cosmic strings, cosmic superstrings, or
inflation, and more generally providing a vantage on the universe whose
revolutionary potential has not been seen in the 400 years since Galileo
first turned a telescope to the heavens.

significantly harder than that inferred from several previous

results based either on a single large scale Galactic CRE component or
by invoking additional electron-positron primary sources, e.g.
nearby pulsars or particle dark matter annihilation. We show that while
the reported Fermi-LAT data alone can be interpreted in terms of a
single component scenario, when combined with other complementary
experimental results, specifically the CRE spectrum measured by H.E.S.S.
and especially the positron fraction reported by PAMELA between 1 and
100 GeV, that class of models fails to provide a consistent
interpretation. Rather, we find that several combinations of parameters,
involving both the pulsar and dark matter scenarios, allow a consistent
description of those results. We also briefly discuss the possibility of
discriminating between the pulsar and dark matter interpretations by
looking for a possible anisotropy in the CRE flux.

 abstract = "{Pulsars are born with subsecond spin periods and slow by electromagnetic
braking for several tens of millions of years, when detectable radiation
ceases. A second life can occur for neutron stars in binary systems.
They can acquire mass and angular momentum from their companions, to be
spun up to millisecond periods and begin radiating again. We searched
Fermi Large Area Telescope data for pulsations from all known
millisecond pulsars (MSPs) outside of globular clusters, using rotation
parameters from radio telescopes. Strong gamma-ray pulsations were
detected for eight MSPs. The gamma-ray pulse profiles and spectral
properties resemble those of young gamma-ray pulsars. The basic emission
mechanism seems to be the same for MSPs and young pulsars, with the
emission originating in regions far from the neutron star surface.

radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum. Although there are more
than 1800 known radio pulsars, until recently only seven were observed
to pulse in gamma rays, and these were all discovered at other
wavelengths. The Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) makes it possible to
pinpoint neutron stars through their gamma-ray pulsations. We report the
detection of 16 gamma-ray pulsars in blind frequency searches using the
LAT. Most of these pulsars are coincident with previously unidentified
gamma-ray sources, and many are associated with supernova remnants.
Direct detection of gamma-ray pulsars enables studies of emission
mechanisms, population statistics, and the energetics of pulsar wind
nebulae and supernova remnants.

gravity suffers from two different strong coupling problems, extending
all the way into the deep infra-red. The first of these is associated
with the principle of detailed balance and explains why solutions to
General Relativity are typically not recovered in models that preserve
this structure. The second of these occurs even without detailed balance
and is associated with the breaking of diffeomorphism invariance,
required for anisotropic scaling in the UV. Since there is a reduced
symmetry group there are additional degrees of freedom, which need not
decouple in the infra-red. Indeed, we use the Stuckelberg trick to show
that one of these extra modes become strongly coupled as the parameters
approach their desired infra-red fixed point. Whilst we can evade the
first strong coupling problem by breaking detailed balance, we cannot
avoid the second, whatever the form of the potential. Therefore the
original Ho{\v r}ava model, and its ''phenomenologically viable''
extensions do not have a perturbative General Relativity limit at any
scale. Experiments which confirm the perturbative gravitational wave
prediction of General Relativity, such as the cumulative shift of the
periastron time of binary pulsars, will presumably rule out the theory.

correlations with sources from a subset of the recent Fermi Bright

sources based on their categorization in the BSL, taking all confirmed
or possible Galactic sources in the field of view of Milagro. Of the 34
Fermi sources selected, 14 are observed by Milagro at a significance of
3 standard deviations or more. We conduct this search with a new
analysis which employs newly optimized gamma-hadron separation and
utilizes the full eight-year Milagro data set. Milagro is sensitive to
gamma rays with energy from 1 to 100 TeV with a peak sensitivity from 10
to 50 TeV depending on the source spectrum and declination. These
results extend the observation of these sources far above the Fermi
energy band. With the new analysis and additional data, multi-TeV
emission is definitively observed associated with the Fermi pulsar,
J2229.0+6114, in the Boomerang pulsar wind nebula (PWN). Furthermore, an
extended region of multi-TeV emission is associated with the Fermi
pulsar, J0634.0+1745, the Geminga pulsar.

 abstract = "{Context: AGILE is an Italian Space Agency mission dedicated to observing
the gamma-ray Universe. The AGILE's very innovative instrumentation for
the first time combines a gamma-ray imager (sensitive in the energy
range 30 MeV-50 GeV), a hard X-ray imager (sensitive in the range 18-60
keV), a calorimeter (sensitive in the range 350 keV-100 MeV), and an
anticoincidence system. AGILE was successfully launched on 2007 April 23
from the Indian base of Sriharikota and was inserted in an equatorial
orbit with very low particle background.  <BR />Aims: AGILE provides
crucial data for the study of active galactic nuclei, gamma-ray bursts,
pulsars, unidentified gamma-ray sources, galactic compact objects,
supernova remnants, TeV sources, and fundamental physics by microsecond
timing. <BR />Methods: An optimal sky angular positioning (reaching 0.1
degrees in gamma-rays and 1-2 arcmin in hard X-rays) and very large
fields of view (2.5 sr and 1 sr, respectively) are obtained by the use
of Silicon detectors integrated in a very compact instrument.  <BR />Results: AGILE surveyed the gamma-ray sky and detected many Galactic
and extragalactic sources during the first months of observations.
Particular emphasis is given to multifrequency observation programs of
extragalactic and galactic objects.  <BR />Conclusions: AGILE is a
successful high-energy gamma-ray mission that reached its nominal
scientific performance. The AGILE Cycle-1 pointing program started on
2007 December 1, and is open to the international community through a
Guest Observer Program.

 abstract = "{The excesses of the cosmic positron fraction recently measured by PAMELA
and the electron spectra by ATIC, PPB-BETS, Fermi, and H.E.S.S. indicate
the existence of primary electron and positron sources. The possible
explanations include dark matter annihilation, decay, and astrophysical
origin, like pulsars. In this work we show that these three scenarios
can all explain the experimental results of the cosmic
e^{±} excess. However, it may be difficult to
discriminate these different scenarios by the local measurements of
electrons and positrons. We propose possible discriminations among these
scenarios through the synchrotron and inverse Compton radiation of the
primary electrons/positrons from the region close to the Galactic
center. Taking typical configurations, we find the three scenarios
predict quite different spectra and skymaps of the synchrotron and
inverse Compton radiation, though there are relatively large
uncertainties. The most prominent differences come from the energy band
10^{4}{\tilde}10^{9}MHz for synchrotron emission and
{\gsim}10GeV for inverse Compton emission. It might be able to
discriminate at least the annihilating dark matter scenario from the
other two given the high precision synchrotron and diffuse {$\gamma$}-ray
skymaps in the future.

 abstract = "{We analyze new diffuse gamma-ray data from the Fermi Gamma-ray Space
Telescope, which do not confirm an excess in the EGRET data at galactic
mid-latitudes, in combination with measurements of electron and positron
fluxes from PAMELA, Fermi and HESS within the context of three possible
sources: dark matter (DM) annihilation or decay into charged leptons,
and a continuum distribution of pulsars. We allow for variations in the
backgrounds, consider several DM halo profiles, and account for
systematic uncertainties in data where possible. We find that all three
scenarios represent the data well. The pulsar description holds for a
wide range of injection energy spectra. We compare with ATIC data and
the WMAP haze where appropriate, but do not fit these data since the
former are discrepant with Fermi data and the latter are subject to
large systematic uncertainties. We show that for cusped halo profiles,
Fermi could observe a spectacular gamma-ray signal of DM annihilation
from the galactic center while seeing no excess at mid-latitudes.

The high-quality pulse profile, with some 32,400 pulsed photons at E

fine as 0.3 ms and a distinct third peak, which shifts in phase
with energy. We examine the high-energy behavior of the pulsed emission;
initial spectra suggest a phase-averaged power-law index of {$\Gamma$} =
1.51^{+0.05} _{-0.04} with an exponential cutoff
at E_{c} = 2.9 {\plusmn} 0.1 GeV. Spectral fits with
generalized cutoffs of the form e\^{}$\{$-(E/E\_c)\^{}b$\}$ require b {\lt}= 1, which
is inconsistent with magnetic pair attenuation, and thus favor
outer-magnetosphere emission models. Finally, we report on upper limits
to any unpulsed component, as might be associated with a surrounding

 abstract = "{Antiparticles account for a small fraction of cosmic rays and are known
to be produced in interactions between cosmic-ray nuclei and atoms in
the interstellar medium, which is referred to as a `secondary source'.
Positrons might also originate in objects such as pulsars and
microquasars or through dark matter annihilation, which would be
`primary sources'. Previous statistically limited measurements of the
ratio of positron and electron fluxes have been interpreted as evidence
for a primary source for the positrons, as has an increase in the total
electron+positron flux at energies between 300 and 600GeV (ref. 8). Here
we report a measurement of the positron fraction in the energy range
1.5-100GeV. We find that the positron fraction increases sharply over
much of that range, in a way that appears to be completely inconsistent
with secondary sources. We therefore conclude that a primary source, be
it an astrophysical object or dark matter annihilation, is necessary.

large flux of positrons (relative to electrons) in the cosmic ray

matter particles in many models are predicted to contribute to the
cosmic ray positron spectrum in this energy range, a great deal of
interest has resulted from this observation. Here, we consider pulsars
(rapidly spinning, magnetized neutron stars) as an alternative source of
this signal. After calculating the contribution to the cosmic ray
positron and electron spectra from pulsars, we find that the spectrum
observed by PAMELA could plausibly originate from such sources. In
particular, a significant contribution is expected from the sum of all
mature pulsars throughout the Milky Way, as well as from the most nearby
mature pulsars (such as Geminga and B0656+14). The signal from nearby
pulsars is expected to generate a small but significant dipole
anisotropy in the cosmic ray electron spectrum, potentially providing a
method by which the Fermi gamma-ray space telescope would be capable of
discriminating between the pulsar and dark matter origins of the
observed high energy positrons.

electron-positron pairs produced by nearby pulsars. While this
possibility was pointed out a long time ago, the greatly improved
quality of current data potentially allow to reverse-engineer the
problem: given the regions of pulsar parameter space favored by PAMELA
and by ATIC, are there known pulsars that explain the data with
reasonable assumptions on the injected e+e- pairs? In the context of
simple benchmark models for estimating the e+e- output, we consider all
known pulsars, as listed in the most complete available catalogue. We
find that it is unlikely that a single pulsar be responsible for both
the PAMELA e+ fraction anomaly and for the ATIC excess, although two
single sources are in principle enough to explain both experimental
results. The PAMELA excess e+ likely come from a set of mature pulsars
(age \~{} 10\^{}6 yr), with a distance of 0.8-1 kpc, or from a single, younger
and closer source like Geminga. The ATIC data require a larger (and less
plausible) energy output, and favor an origin associated to powerful,
more distant (1-2 kpc) and younger (age \~{} 10\^{}5\$ yr) pulsars. We list
several candidate pulsars that can individually or coherently contribute
to explain the PAMELA and ATIC data. Although generally suppressed, we
find that the contribution of pulsars more distant than 1-2 kpc could
contribute for the ATIC excess. Finally, we stress the multi-faceted and
decisive role that Fermi-LAT will play in the very near future by (1)
providing an exquisite measurement of the e+e- flux, (2) unveiling the
existence of as yet undetected pulsars, and (3) searching for
anisotropies in the arrival direction of high-energy e+e-.

pulsed electromagnetic emission. Measuring the high-end region of a
pulsar{\rsquo}s spectrum would shed light on this question. By developing
a new electronic trigger, we lowered the threshold of the Major
Atmospheric {$\gamma$}-ray Imaging Cherenkov (MAGIC) telescope to 25
giga-electron volts. In this configuration, we detected pulsed
{$\gamma$}-rays from the Crab pulsar that were greater than 25
giga-electron volts, revealing a relatively high cutoff energy in the
phase-averaged spectrum. This indicates that the emission occurs far out
in the magnetosphere, hence excluding the polar-cap scenario as a
possible explanation of our measurement. The high cutoff energy also
challenges the slot-gap scenario.

(SNRs)] are the most visible remains after massive stars, ending their
lives, explode in core-collapse supernovae. The Fermi Gamma-Ray Space
Telescope has unveiled a radio quiet pulsar located near the center of

pulsar, discovered through its gamma-ray pulsations, has a period of
316.86 milliseconds and a period derivative of 3.614 {\times}
10^{‑13} seconds per second. Its characteristic age of
10^{4} years is comparable to that estimated for the SNR. We
speculate that most unidentified Galactic gamma-ray sources associated
with star-forming regions and SNRs are such young pulsars.

which are believed to be accelerated to relativistic speeds in supernova

decreases as a power law with increasing energy (for example as

synchrotron and inverse Compton processes, resulting in a relatively
short lifetime (about 10^{5}years) and a rapidly falling
intensity, which raises the possibility of seeing the contribution from
individual nearby sources (less than one kiloparsec away). Here we
report an excess of galactic cosmic-ray electrons at energies of
\~{}300-800GeV, which indicates a nearby source of energetic electrons.
Such a source could be an unseen astrophysical object (such as a pulsar
or micro-quasar) that accelerates electrons to those energies, or the
electrons could arise from the annihilation of dark matter particles
(such as a Kaluza-Klein particle with a mass of about 620GeV).

masses of M=0.060^{+0.028}_{-0.021} M_{solar}

M_{⊕} for the planet. However, the observational coverage
of the planetary deviation is sparse and incomplete, and the radius of
the source was estimated without the benefit of a source star color
measurement. As a result, the 2 {$\sigma$} limits on the mass ratio and
finite source measurements are weak. Nevertheless, the microlensing
parallax signal clearly favors a substellar mass planetary host, and the
measurement of finite source effects in the light curve supports this
conclusion. Adaptive optics images taken with the Very Large Telescope
(VLT) NACO instrument are consistent with a lens star that is either a
brown dwarf or a star at the bottom of the main sequence. Follow-up VLT
and/or Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations will either confirm
that the primary is a brown dwarf or detect the low-mass lens star and
enable a precise determination of its mass. In either case, the lens
star, MOA-2007-BLG-192L, is the lowest mass primary known to have a
companion with a planetary mass ratio, and the planet,
MOA-2007-BLG-192Lb, is probably the lowest mass exoplanet found to date,
aside from the lowest mass pulsar planet.

spontaneous breaking of translation invariance by the spatial modulation
of the gap parameter {$\Delta$}. These massless bosons describe space- and
time-dependent fluctuations of the crystal structure and are analogous
to the phonons in ordinary crystals. The coefficients of the spatial
derivative terms of the phonon effective Lagrangian are related to the
elastic moduli of the crystal; the coefficients that encode the linear
response of the crystal to a shearing stress define the shear modulus.
We analyze the two particular crystal structures which are energetically
favored over a wide range of densities, in each case evaluating the
phonon effective action and the shear modulus up to order
{$\Delta$}^{2} in a Ginzburg-Landau expansion, finding shear moduli
which are 20 to 1000 times larger than those of neutron star crusts. The
crystalline color superconducting phase has long been known to be a
superfluid{\mdash}by picking a phase its order parameter breaks the
quark-number U(1)_{B} symmetry spontaneously. Our results
demonstrate that this superfluid phase of matter is at the same time a
rigid solid. We close with a rough estimate of the pinning force on the
rotational vortices which would be formed embedded within this rigid
superfluid upon rotation. Our results raise the possibility that (some)
pulsar glitches could originate within a quark matter core deep within a

pulsar was undetected in archival radio observations from 1998, implying
a flux {\lt}0.2 times the present level. Together with the transient

about the internal composition), and X-ray observations of accreting and

Newtonian code explode. However, some of the cores left behind in our

masses that are larger than the canonical \~{}1.5 M_{solar} of
well-measured pulsars. We investigate the roles of the standing
accretion shock instability (SASI), the excitation of core g-modes, the
generation of core acoustic power, the ejection of matter with r-process
potential, the windlike character of the explosion, and the fundamental
anisotropy of the blasts. We find that the breaking of spherical
symmetry is central to the supernova phenomenon, the delays to explosion
can be long, and the blasts, when top-bottom asymmetric, are
self-collimating. We see indications that the initial explosion energies
are larger for the more massive progenitors and smaller for the less
massive progenitors and that the neutrino contribution to the explosion
energy may be an increasing function of progenitor mass. However, the
explosion energy is still accumulating by the end of our simulations and
has not converged to final values. The degree of explosion asymmetry we
obtain is completely consistent with that inferred from the polarization
measurements of Type Ic supernovae. Furthermore, we calculate for the
first time the magnitude and sign of the net impulse on the core due to
anisotropic neutrino emission and suggest that hydrodynamic and neutrino
recoils in the context of our asymmetric explosions afford a natural
mechanism for observed pulsar proper motions.

testing Einstein's theory of general relativity and alternative theories

observations taken over the 2.5 years since its discovery and present
four independent strong-field tests of general relativity. These tests
use the theory-independent mass ratio of the two stars. By measuring
relativistic corrections to the Keplerian description of the orbital
motion, we find that the ``post-Keplerian'' parameter s agrees with the
value predicted by general relativity within an uncertainty of 0.05\%,
the most precise test yet obtained. We also show that the transverse
velocity of the system's center of mass is extremely small. Combined
with the system's location near the Sun, this result suggests that
future tests of gravitational theories with the double pulsar will
supersede the best current solar system tests. It also implies that the
second-born pulsar may not have formed through the core collapse of a
helium star, as is usually assumed.

core-collapse supernovae by means of 2D simulations with approximative
neutrino transport and boundary conditions that parameterize the effects
of the contracting neutron star and allow us to obtain sufficiently
strong neutrino heating and, hence, neutrino-driven explosions.
Confirming more idealised studies, as well as supernova simulations with
spectral transport, we find that random seed perturbations can grow by
hydrodynamic instabilities to a globally asymmetric mass distribution in
the region between the nascent neutron star and the accretion shock,
leading to a dominance of dipole (l=1) and quadrupole (l=2) modes in the
explosion ejecta, provided the onset of the supernova explosion is
sufficiently slower than the growth time scale of the low-mode
instability. By gravitational and hydrodynamic forces, the anisotropic
mass distribution causes an acceleration of the nascent neutron star,
which lasts for several seconds and can propel the neutron star to
velocities of more than 1000 km s^{-1}. Because the explosion
anisotropies develop chaotically and change by small differences in the
fluid flow, the magnitude of the kick varies stochastically. No
systematic dependence of the average neutron star velocity on the
explosion energy or the properties of the considered progenitors is
found. Instead, the anisotropy of the mass ejection, and hence of the
kick, seems to increase when the nascent neutron star contracts more
quickly, and thus low-mode instabilities can grow more rapidly. Our more
than 70 models separate into two groups, one with high and the other
with low neutron star velocities and accelerations after one second of
post-bounce evolution, depending on whether the l=1 mode is dominant in
the ejecta or not. This leads to a bimodality of the distribution when
the neutron star velocities are extrapolated to their terminal values.
Establishing a link to the measured distribution of pulsar velocities,
however, requires a much larger set of calculations and ultimately 3D
modelling.

to a set of relativistic EoSs which are constrained otherwise from

Aims: .The purpose is to investigate whether the interaction of the
relativistic wind from a young pulsar with the wind from its stellar
companion, as in PSR B1259-63, constitutes a viable scenario for
explaining the observations of LS 5039 and LS I+61{\deg}303. Emission
arises from the shocked pulsar wind material, which then flows away to
large distances in a comet-shape tail, reproducing on a smaller scale
what is observed in isolated, high motion pulsars interacting with the
interstellar medium.<BR /> Methods: .The timescales for acceleration and
radiation of particles at the shock between the pulsar wind and stellar
wind are calculated. Simple expectations for the spectral energy
distribution (SED) are derived and are shown to depend on very few input
parameters. Detailed modelling of the particle evolution is attempted
and compared to the observations from radio to TeV energies.<BR />
Results: .Acceleration at the shock provides high-energy electrons that
steadily emit synchrotron in X-rays and inverse Compton scatter stellar
light to {$\gamma$}-rays. Electrons streaming out of the system emit at IR
frequencies and below. The overall aspect of the SEDs is adequately
reproduced for standard values of the parameters. The morphology of the
radio tail can mimic a microquasar jet. Good agreement is found with the
published VLBI map of LS 5039 and predictions are made on the expected
change in appearance with orbital phase.<BR /> Conclusions: .The pulsar
wind scenario provides a common, viable framework for interpreting the
emission from all three {$\gamma$}-ray binaries.

observed from more than 1,700 neutron stars with weaker magnetic fields

narrow, highly linearly polarized radio pulses, observed at every
rotation, thereby establishing that magnetars can be radio pulsars.
There is no evidence of radio emission before the 2003 X-ray outburst

flux varies from day to day. The flux at all radio frequencies is
approximately equal-and at {\gt}20GHz XTE J1810 - 197 is currently the

the absolute one-dimensional velocity components are exponentially
distributed and with a three-dimensional mean velocity of
380^{+40}_{-60} km s^{-1}. We then proceed with
a Monte Carlo-based population synthesis, modeling the birth properties
of the pulsars, their time evolution, and their detection in the Parkes

appears generally consistent with the observations. Our results suggest
that pulsars are born in the spiral arms, with a galactocentric radial
distribution that is well described by the functional form proposed by
Yusifov {\amp} K{\"u}{\c c}{\"u}k, in which the pulsar surface
density peaks at radius \~{}3 kpc. The birth spin period distribution
extends to several hundred milliseconds, with no evidence of
multimodality. Models that assume the radio luminosities of pulsars to
be independent of the spin periods and period derivatives are
inadequate, as they lead to the detection of too many old simulated
pulsars in our simulations. Dithered radio luminosities proportional to
the square root of the spin-down luminosity accommodate the observations
well and provide a natural mechanism for the pulsars to dim uniformly as
they approach the death line, avoiding an observed pileup on the latter.
There is no evidence for significant torque decay (due to magnetic field
decay or otherwise) over the lifetime of the pulsars as radio sources
(\~{}100 Myr). Finally, we estimate the pulsar birthrate and total number
of pulsars in the Galaxy.

supernova models and, if the material pushes the neutron star over its

could dramatically affect the early evolution of pulsars, yet there are
few observational constraints on whether significant fallback occurs or
even the actual existence of such disks. Here we report the discovery of
mid-infrared emission from a cool disk around an isolated young X-ray
pulsar. The disk does not power the pulsar's X-ray emission but is
passively illuminated by these X-rays. The estimated mass of the disk is
of the order of 10 Earth masses, and its lifetime ({\gt}=
10^{6}years) significantly exceeds the spin-down age of the
pulsar, supporting a supernova fallback origin. The disk resembles
protoplanetary disks seen around ordinary young stars, suggesting the

of sources of non-thermal radiation. The inner section of this SNR,
within 2 degrees of the pulsar <ASTROBJ>PSR B0833-45</ASTROBJ>, has been
observed by the HESS {$\gamma$}-ray atmospheric Cherenkov detector in 2004

of the pulsar, within an integration region of radius 0.8{\deg} around
the position ({$\alpha$} = 08^{h} 35^{m} 00^{s},
{$\delta$} = -45{\deg} 36 arcmin J2000.0). The excess coincides with a
region of hard X-ray emission seen by the ROSAT and ASCA satellites. The
observed energy spectrum of the source between 550 GeV and 65 TeV is
well fit by a power law function with photon index {$\Gamma$} = 1.45

exponential cutoff at an energy of 13.8 {\plusmn} 2.3_{stat}

clear measurement of a peak in the spectral energy distribution from a

fit of an Inverse Compton model to the HESS spectral energy distribution
gives a total energy in non-thermal electrons of \~{}2 {\times}
10^{45} erg between 5 TeV and 100 TeV, assuming a distance of
290 parsec to the pulsar. The best fit electron power law index is 2.0,
with a spectral break at 67 TeV.

the potential of radio-transient searches is high. This was demonstrated
recently by the discovery of a previously unknown type of source,
varying on timescales of minutes to hours. Here we report a search for
radio sources that vary on much shorter timescales. We found eleven
objects characterized by single, dispersed bursts having durations
between 2 and 30ms. The average time intervals between bursts range from
4min to 3h with radio emission typically detectable for {\lt}1s per day.
From an analysis of the burst arrival times, we have identified
periodicities in the range 0.4-7s for ten of the eleven sources,
suggesting origins in rotating neutron stars. Despite the small number
of sources detected at present, their ephemeral nature implies a total
Galactic population significantly exceeding that of the regularly
pulsing radio pulsars. Five of the ten sources have periods {\gt}4s, and
the rate of change of the pulse period has been measured for three of
them; for one source, we have inferred a high magnetic field strength of
5 {\times} 10^{13}G. This suggests that the new population is
related to other classes of isolated neutron stars observed at X-ray and
{$\gamma$}-ray wavelengths.

angular momentum transport by magnetic torques during the precollapse
evolution is known to sap the core of the necessary rotation. Here we
explore the evolution of very rapidly rotating massive stars, including
stripped-down helium cores that might result from mergers or mass
transfer in a binary, and single stars that rotate unusually rapidly on
the main sequence. For the highest possible rotation rates (about 400 km
s^{-1}), a novel sort of evolution is encountered in which
single stars mix completely on the main sequence, never becoming red
giants. Such stars, essentially massive ``blue stragglers,'' produce
helium-oxygen cores that rotate unusually rapidly. Such stars might
comprise roughly 1\% of all stars above 10 M_{solar} and can,
under certain circumstances, retain enough angular momentum to make
GRBs. Because this possibility is very sensitive to mass loss, GRBs are
much more probable in regions of low metallicity.

measurement of Shapiro delay, it implies a pulsar mass of 2.1+/-0.2
M_{solar}, the most massive pulsar measured. This adds to the
emerging trend toward relatively high neutron star masses in neutron
star-white dwarf binaries. In addition, there is some evidence for an
inverse correlation between pulsar mass and orbital period in these
systems. We consider alternatives to the general relativistic analysis
of the data, and we use the pulsar timing data to place limits on
violations of the strong equivalence principle.

a highly eccentric orbit. The observations around the 2004 periastron
passage of the pulsar were performed with the four 13 m Cherenkov
telescopes of the HESS experiment, recently installed in Namibia and in
full operation since December 2003. Between February and June 2004, a
{$\gamma$}-ray signal from the binary system was detected with a total
significance above 13{$\sigma$}. The flux was found to vary significantly
on timescales of days which makes PSR B1259-63 the first variable
galactic source of VHE {$\gamma$}-rays observed so far. Strong emission
signals were observed in pre- and post-periastron phases with a flux
minimum around periastron, followed by a gradual flux decrease in the
months after. The measured time-averaged energy spectrum above a mean
threshold energy of 380 GeV can be fitted by a simple power law F\_0(E/1

multi-TeV energies in the binary system. In combination with coeval
observations of the X-ray synchrotron emission by the RXTE and INTEGRAL
instruments, and assuming the VHE {$\gamma$}-ray emission to be produced by
the inverse Compton mechanism, the magnetic field strength can be
directly estimated to be of the order of 1 G.

those pulsars for which multiple measurements are available, the
majority of the proper motions (58 per cent) are derived from pulsar
timing methods, 41 per cent using interferometers and the remaining 1
per cent using optical telescopes. Many of the one-dimensional (1D) and
two-dimensional (2D) speeds (referring to speeds measured in one
coordinate only and the magnitudes of the transverse velocities,
respectively) derived from these measurements are somewhat lower than
earlier estimates because of the use of the most recent electron density
model in determining pulsar distances. The mean 1D speeds for the normal
and recycled pulsars are 152(10) and 54(6)kms^{-1},
respectively. The corresponding mean 2D speeds are 246(22) and
87(13)kms^{-1}. PSRs B2011+38 and B2224+64 have the highest
inferred 2D speeds of \~{}1600 km s^{-1}. We study the mean speeds
for different subsamples and find that, in general, they agree with
previous results. Applying a novel deconvolution technique to the sample
of 73 pulsars with characteristic ages less than 3Myr, we find the mean
three-dimensional (3D) pulsar birth velocity to be
400(40)kms^{-1}. The distribution of velocities is well
described by a Maxwellian distribution with 1D rms {$\sigma$}= 265 km
s^{-1}. There is no evidence for a bimodal velocity
distribution. The proper motions for PSRs B1830-08 and B2334+61 are
consistent with their proposed associations with the supernova remnants

calculations to follow the evolution of rotating massive stars
including, at least approximately, all these effects, magnetic and
nonmagnetic, from the zero-age main sequence until the onset of
iron-core collapse. The evolution and action of the magnetic fields is
as described by Spruit in 2002, and a range of uncertain parameters is
explored. In general, we find that magnetic torques decrease the final
rotation rate of the collapsing iron core by about a factor of 30-50
when compared with the nonmagnetic counterparts. Angular momentum in
that part of the presupernova star destined to become a neutron star is
an increasing function of main-sequence mass. That is, pulsars derived
from more massive stars rotate faster and rotation plays a more
important role in the star's explosion. The final angular momentum of
the core has been determined-to within a factor of 2-by the time the
star ignites carbon burning. For the lighter stars studied, around 15
M_{solar}, we predict pulsar periods at birth near 15 ms, though
a factor of 2 range is easily tolerated by the uncertainties. Several
mechanisms for additional braking in a young neutron star, especially by
fallback, are explored.

occasionally become `active', producing many short X-ray bursts.
Extremely rarely, an SGR emits a giant flare with a total energy about a
thousand times higher than in a typical burst. Here we report that SGR
1806-20 emitted a giant flare on 27 December 2004. The total (isotropic)
flare energy is 2 {\times} 10^{46}erg, which is about a hundred
times higher than the other two previously observed giant flares. The
energy release probably occurred during a catastrophic reconfiguration
of the neutron star's magnetic field. If the event had occurred at a
larger distance, but within 40 megaparsecs, it would have resembled a
short, hard {$\gamma$}-ray burst, suggesting that flares from extragalactic
SGRs may form a subclass of such bursts.

``minimal'' cooling or ``enhanced'' cooling, is proposed. The minimal
cooling scenario replaces and extends the so-called standard cooling
scenario to include neutrino emission from the Cooper pair breaking and
formation process. This emission dominates that due to the modified Urca
process for temperatures close to the critical temperature for
superfluid pairing. Minimal cooling is distinguished from enhanced
cooling by the absence of neutrino emission from any direct Urca
process, due either to nucleons or to exotica such as hyperons, Bose
condensates, or deconfined quarks. Within the minimal cooling scenario,
theoretical cooling models can be considered to be a four parameter
family involving the equation of state (including various compositional
possibilities) of dense matter, superfluid properties of dense matter,
the composition of the neutron star envelope, and the mass of the
neutron star. The consequences of minimal cooling are explored through
extensive variations of these parameters. The results are compared with
the inferred properties of thermally emitting neutron stars in order to
ascertain if enhanced cooling occurs in any of them.

All stars for which thermal emissions have been clearly detected are at
least marginally consistent with the lack of enhanced cooling, given the
combined uncertainties in ages and temperatures or luminosities. The two
pulsars PSR 0833-45 (Vela) and PSR 1706-44 would require enhanced
cooling in case their ages and/or temperatures are on the lower side of
their estimated values, whereas the four stars PSR 0656+14, PSR 1055-52,
Geminga, and RX J0720.4-3125 may require some source of internal heating
in case their age and/or luminosity are on the upper side of their
estimated values. The new upper limits on the thermal luminosity of PSR
J0205+6449 (in the supernova remnant 3C 58) and RX J0007.0+7302 (in CTA
1) are indicative of the occurrence of some enhanced neutrino emission
beyond the minimal scenario.

For this reason, in this state the gap varies in space, the ground state
is inhomogeneous, and a crystalline structure might be formed. This
situation was considered for the first time by Fulde and Ferrell (1964)

in the vacuum state is a characteristic feature of this phase and is
associated with the presence of long-wavelength excitations of zero

matter cosmology, including star formation and the effects of energetic
stellar feedback processes and of a metagalactic UV field, have been
performed, resulting in a mix of realistic disk, lenticular, and
elliptical galaxies at redshift z=0. The disk galaxies are deficient in
angular momentum by only about a factor of 2 compared with observed disk
galaxies for simulations with fairly strong starbursts in early,
protogalactic clouds, leading to ``blow-away'' of the remaining gas in
the clouds. In this respect the present scenario is hence doing almost
as well as the warm dark matter (WDM) scenarios discussed by
Sommer-Larsen {\amp} Dolgov. The surface density profiles of the stellar
disks are approximately exponential, and those of the bulges range from
exponential to r^{1/4}, as observed. The bulge-to-disk ratios of
the disk galaxies are consistent with observations, as are their
integrated B-V colors, which have been calculated using stellar
population synthesis techniques. Furthermore, the observed I-band
Tully-Fisher relation can be matched, provided that the stellar
mass-to-light ratio of disk galaxies is M/L_{I}\~{}0.8, similar to
what was found by Sommer-Larsen {\amp} Dolgov from their WDM simulations
and in fair agreement with several recent observational determinations
of M/L_{I} for disk galaxies. The elliptical and lenticular
galaxies have approximately r^{1/4} stellar surface density
profiles, are dominated by nondisklike kinematics, and are flattened as
a result of nonisotropic stellar velocity distributions, again
consistent with observations. Hot halo gas is predicted to cool out and
be accreted onto the Galactic disk at a rate of 0.5-1 M_{solar}
yr^{-1} at z=0, consistent with upper limits deduced from Far
Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer observations of O VI. We have
analyzed in detail the formation history of two disk galaxies with
circular speeds comparable to that of the Milky Way and find gas
accretion rates, and hence bolometric X-ray luminosities of the halos,
6-7 times larger at z\~{}1 than at z=0 for these disk galaxies. More
generally, it is found that gas infall rates onto these disks are nearly
exponentially declining with time, both for the total disk and for the
``solar cylinder.'' This theoretical result hence supports the
exponentially declining gas infall approximation often used in chemical
evolution models. The infall timescales deduced are \~{}5-6 Gyr, comparable
to what is adopted in current chemical evolution models to solve the ``G
dwarf problem.'' The disk of one of the two galaxies forms
``inside-out,'' the other ``outside-in,'' but in both cases the mean
ages of the stars in the outskirts of the disks are {\gt}\~{}6-8 Gyr, fairly
consistent with the findings of Ferguson {\amp} Johnson for the disk of
M31. The amount of hot gas in disk galaxy halos is consistent with
observational upper limits. The globular cluster M53 and the LMC are
``inserted'' in the halos of the two Milky Way-like disk galaxies, and
dispersion measures to these objects are calculated. The results are
consistent with upper limits from observed dispersion measures to
pulsars in these systems. Finally, the results of the simulations
indicate that the observed peak in the cosmic star formation rate at
redshift z\~{}2 can be reproduced. Depending on the star formation and
feedback scenarios, one predicts either a cosmic star formation rate
that decreases monotonically with redshift beyond these redshifts or a
second peak at z\~{}6-8, corresponding to the putative Population III and
interestingly similar to recent estimates of the redshift at which the
universe was reionized. These various scenarios should hence be
observationally constrainable with upcoming instruments such as the
James Webb Space Telescope and the Atacama Large Millimeter Array.

star exhibit thermonuclear X-ray bursts that last tens of seconds,
caused by unstable nuclear burning on their surfaces. Millisecond-period
brightness oscillations during bursts from ten neutron stars (as
distinct from other rapid X-ray variability that is also observed) are
thought to measure the stellar spin, but direct proof of a rotational
origin has been lacking. Here we report the detection of burst
oscillations at the known spin frequency of an accreting millisecond
pulsar, and we show that these oscillations always have the same
rotational phase. This firmly establishes burst oscillations as
nuclear-powered pulsations tracing the spin of accreting neutron stars,
corroborating earlier evidence. The distribution of spin frequencies of
the 11 nuclear-powered pulsars cuts off well below the breakup frequency
for most neutron-star models, supporting theoretical predictions that
gravitational radiation losses can limit accretion torques in spinning
up millisecond pulsars.

observations and analysis methods. For lines of sight directed out of
the Galactic plane, the new model yields substantially larger values for
pulsar dispersion measures, except for directions dominated by the local
hot bubble. Unlike the TC93 model, the new model provides sufficient
electrons to account for the dispersion measures of the vast majority of
known, Galactic pulsars. The new model is described and exemplified
using plots of astronomically useful quantities on Galactic-coordinate

observations and analysis techniques that will improve the Galactic

large-scale electrical currents and the effect of resonant Compton
scattering by the charge carriers (both electrons and ions) on the

soft gamma repeaters (SGRs) and anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs), these
currents are maintained by magnetic stresses acting deep inside the
star, which generate both sudden disruptions (SGR outbursts) and more
gradual plastic deformations of the rigid crust. We construct
self-similar force-free equilibria of the current-carrying magnetosphere
with a power-law dependence of magnetic field on radius,
B\~{}r^{-(2+p)}, and show that a large-scale twist of field lines
softens the radial dependence of the magnetic field to p{\lt}1. The
spin-down torque acting on the star is thereby increased in comparison
with an orthogonal vacuum dipole. We comment on the strength of the
surface magnetic field in the SGR and AXP sources, as inferred from
their measured spin-down rates, and the implications of this model for
the narrow measured distribution of spin periods. A magnetosphere with a
strong twist [B_{φ}/B_{θ}=O(1) at the
equator] has an optical depth \~{}1 to resonant cyclotron scattering,
independent of frequency (radius), surface magnetic field strength, or

the emerging X-ray flux at the cyclotron resonance will strongly modify
the emerging pulse profile and, through the Doppler effect, generate a
nonthermal tail to the X-ray spectrum. We relate the sudden change in
the pulse profile of SGR 1900+14 following the 1998 August 27 giant
flare to an enhanced optical depth at the electron cyclotron resonance

generate frequency-independent profiles; more complicated pulse profiles

0.4 GHz pulsar surveys. We do so by modeling the evolution of the
locations, velocities, spins, and radio luminosities of pulsars,
calculating pulsed flux according to a beaming model and random
orientation angles of spin and beam, applying selection effects of
pulsar surveys, and comparing model distributions of measurable pulsar
properties with survey data using a likelihood function. The surveys
analyzed have well-defined characteristics and cover \~{}95\% of the sky. We
maximize the likelihood in a six-dimensional space of observables P, P,
DM, |b|, {$\mu$}, and F (period, period derivative, dispersion measure,
Galactic latitude, proper motion, and flux density, respectively). The
models we test are described by 12 parameters that characterize a
population's birth rate, luminosity, shutoff of radio emission, birth
locations, and birth velocities. We infer that the radio beam luminosity
(1) is comparable to the energy flux of relativistic particles in models
for spin-driven magnetospheres, signifying that radio emission losses
reach nearly 100\% for the oldest pulsars, and (2) scales approximately
as E^{1/2}, which in magnetosphere models is proportional to the
voltage drop available for acceleration of particles. We find that a
two-component velocity distribution with characteristic velocities of 90
and 500 km s^{-1} is greatly preferred to any one-component
distribution; this preference is largely immune to variations in other
population parameters, such as the luminosity or distance scale or the
assumed spin-down law. We explore some consequences of the preferred
birth velocity distribution: (1) roughly 50\% of pulsars in the solar
neighborhood will escape the Galaxy, while \~{}15\% have velocities greater
than 1000 km s^{-1} (2) observational bias against high-velocity
pulsars is relatively unimportant for surveys that reach high Galactic
|z| distances but is severe for spatially bounded surveys; (3) an
important low-velocity population exists that increases the fraction of
neutron stars retained by globular clusters and is consistent with the
number of old objects that accrete from the interstellar medium; (4)
under standard assumptions for supernova remnant expansion and pulsar
spin-down, \~{}10\% of pulsars younger than 20 kyr will appear to lie
outside of their host remnants. Finally, we comment on the ramifications
of our birth velocity distribution for binary survival and the
population of inspiraling binary neutron stars relevant to some GRB
models and potential sources for LIGO.

and intermediate-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs and IMXBs). Using a standard
Henyey-type stellar evolution code and a standard model for binary
interactions, we have calculated 100 binary evolution sequences
containing a neutron star and a normal-type companion star, where the
initial mass of the secondary ranges from 0.6 to 7 M_{solar} and
the initial orbital period from \~{}4 hr to \~{}100 days. This range samples
the entire range of parameters one is likely to encounter for LMXBs and
IMXBs. The sequences show an enormous variety of evolutionary histories
and outcomes, where different mass transfer mechanisms dominate in
different phases. Very few sequences resemble the classical evolution of
cataclysmic variables, where the evolution is driven by magnetic braking
and gravitational radiation alone. Many systems experience a phase of
mass transfer on a thermal timescale and may briefly become detached
immediately after this phase (for the more massive secondaries). In
agreement with previous results (Tauris {\amp} Savonije 1999), we find
that all sequences with (sub)giant donors up to \~{}2 M_{solar} are
stable against dynamical mass transfer. Sequences where the secondary
has a radiative envelope are stable against dynamical mass transfer for
initial masses up to \~{}4 M_{solar}. For higher initial masses,
they experience a delayed dynamical instability after a stable phase of
mass transfer lasting up to \~{}10^{6} yr. Systems where the
initial orbital period is just below the bifurcation period of \~{}18 hr
evolve toward extremely short orbital periods (as short as \~{}10 minutes).
For a 1 M_{solar} secondary, the initial period range that leads
to the formation of ultracompact systems (with minimum periods less than
\~{}40 minutes) is 13-18 hr. Since systems that start mass transfer in this
period range are naturally produced as a result of tidal capture, this
may explain the large fraction of ultracompact LMXBs observed in
globular clusters. The implications of this study for our understanding
of the population of X-ray binaries and the formation of millisecond
pulsars are also discussed.

acquisition systems are described in some detail. For pulsar periods in

about 0.2mJy. At shorter or longer periods or higher dispersions, the
sensitivity is reduced. Timing observations are carried out for pulsars
discovered in the survey for [formmu6]12-18 months after confirmation to
obtain accurate positions, spin parameters, dispersion measures, pulse
shapes and mean flux densities. The survey is proving to be extremely
successful, with more than 600 pulsars discovered so far. We expect
that, when complete, this one survey will come close to finding as many
pulsars as all previous pulsar surveys put together. The newly
discovered pulsars tend to be young, distant and of high radio
luminosity. They will form a valuable sample for studies of pulsar
emission properties, the Galactic distribution and evolution of pulsars,

timing and pulse shape parameters for the first 100 pulsars timed at

that the star's equatorial rotational velocity on the ZAMS ranges from
zero to \~{}70\% of breakup. The stars rotate rigidly on the ZAMS as a
consequence of angular momentum redistribution during the
pre-main-sequence evolution. Redistribution of angular momentum and
chemical species are then followed as a consequence of Eddington-Sweet
circulation, Solberg-H{\o}iland instability, the
Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke instability, and secular and dynamic shear
instability. The effects of the centrifugal force on the stellar
structure are included. Convectively unstable zones are assumed to tend
toward rigid rotation, and uncertain mixing efficiencies are gauged by
observations. We find, as noted in previous work, that rotation
increases the helium core masses and enriches the stellar envelopes with
products of hydrogen burning. We determine, for the first time, the
angular momentum distribution in typical presupernova stars along with
their detailed chemical structure. Angular momentum loss due to
(nonmagnetic) stellar winds and the redistribution of angular momentum
during core hydrogen burning are of crucial importance for the specific
angular momentum of the core. Neglecting magnetic fields, we find
angular momentum transport from the core to the envelope to be
unimportant after core helium burning. We obtain specific angular
momenta for the iron core and overlying material of
10^{16}-10^{17} cm^{2} s^{-1}. These
values are insensitive to the initial angular momentum and to
uncertainties in the efficiencies of rotational mixing. They are small
enough to avoid triaxial deformations of the iron core before it
collapses, but could lead to neutron stars which rotate close to
breakup. They are also in the range required for the collapsar model of
gamma-ray bursts. The apparent discrepancy with the measured rotation
rates of young pulsars is discussed.

result of contraction and expansion, meridional circulation, diffusion

exert a feedback on circulation and diffusion, so that a consistent
treatment is necessary. We review recent results on the evolution of
internal rotation and the surface rotational velocities for stars on the
Upper MS, for red giants, supergiants, and W-R stars. A fast rotation
enhances the mass loss by stellar winds and, conversely, high mass loss
removes a lot of angular momentum. The problem of the breakup or
{$\Omega$}-limit is critically examined in connection with the origin of Be

the lifetimes, the isochrones, the blue-to-red supergiant ratios, the
formation of Wolf-Rayet stars, and the chemical abundances in massive
stars as well as in red giants and AGB stars are reviewed in relation to
recent observations for stars in the Galaxy and Magellanic Clouds. The
effects of rotation on the final stages and on the chemical yields are
examined, along with the constraints placed by the periods of pulsars.

be derived from the rotation of the neutron star. The star gradually
`spins down' as energy is radiated away. Millisecond radio pulsars are
often located in binary systems. In a widely accepted theoretical
model,, they started as ordinary pulsars which lost most of their
magnetic field and were `spun up' to millisecond periods by the
accretion of matter from a companion star in an X-ray binary system.
Evidence for this model has gradually mounted, but direct proof-in the
form of the predicted coherent millisecond X-ray pulsations in the
persistent flux of an X-ray binary has been lacking, despite many

theoretical expectations. The source will probably become a millisecond

associated with young supernova remnants (SNRs), and therefore most
probably with neutron stars, but it remains a puzzle why SGRs are so
different from `normal' radio pulsars. Here we report the discovery of
pulsations in the persistent X-ray flux of SGR1806 - 20, with a period
of 7.47s and a spindown rate of 2.6 {\times}

magnetic dipole emission and find that the pulsar age and (dipolar)
magnetic field strength are \~{}1,500 years and 8{\times}
10^{14}gauss, respectively. Our observations demonstrate the
existence of `magnetars', neutron stars with magnetic fields about 100
times stronger than those of radio pulsars, and support earlier
suggestions, that SGR bursts are caused by neutron-star `crustquakes'
produced by magnetic stresses. The `magnetar' birth rate is about one
per millennium-a substantial fraction of that of radio pulsars. Thus our
results may explain why some SNRs have no radio pulsars.

uncorrelated, or even anticorrelated, in persistent sources. We describe

rotation, provides the main source of free energy, and the decaying

emission observed from these sources. New features that are not present
in the decay of the weaker fields associated with ordinary radio pulsars
include fracturing of the neutron star crust, strong heating of its
core, and effective suppression of thermal conduction perpendicular to
the magnetic field. As the magnetic field is forced through the crust by
diffusive motions in the core, multiple small-scale fractures are
excited, as well as a few large fractures that can power soft gamma
repeater bursts. The decay rate of the core field is a very strong
function of temperature and therefore of the magnetic flux density. The
strongest prediction of the model is that these sources will show no
optical emissions associated with X-ray heating of an accretion disk.

light curves have two distinct peaks (Crab, Vela, Geminga, and PSR

PC. If the inclination {$\alpha$} is comparable to the half-width of the
PC {$\gamma$}-beam, {$\alpha$} {\tilde}{\thetas}_{b}, the peak-to-peak
phase separation can have the large values ({\tilde}0.4-0.5) observed
from these sources. In the model presented here we attribute the
observed interpeak emission to pair cascades above the PC interior.
Our simulation assumes the physics of conventional PC models, in which
the {$\gamma$}-rays are due to photon-pair cascades initiated by
curvature radiation from the acceleration of electrons above the
PCs. In this work we assume that the acceleration occurs over a finite
region that may extend up to several radii above the neutron star
surface. We find that the combined effects of moderately enlarged PC
dimensions and extended acceleration zones resolve a major difficulty
with earlier PC models, namely their small beamwidths (and hence small
detection probabilities).  Our best fits to the observed light curves
are obtained from models in which the accelerated electrons have a
uniform surface density over the PC interior and a sharp density
increase of {\tilde}3-5 near the rim. Based on these assumptions, our
model results for Vela reproduce key features of the light curves and
phase-resolved spectra. We also consider the compatibility of the

 abstract = "{We investigate in this paper the core-collapse supernova explosion
mechanism in both one and two dimensions. With a
radiation/hydrodynamic code based upon the PPM algorithm, we verify
the usefulness of neutrino-driven overturn (''convection'') between the
shock and the neutrinosphere in igniting the supernova explosion. The
two-dimensional simulation of the core of a 15 M_{sun} star
that we present here indicates that the breaking of spherical symmetry
may be central to the explosion itself and that a multitude of bent
and broken fingers is a common feature of the ejecta. As in one
dimension, the explosion seems to be a mathematically critical
phenomenon, evolving from a steady state to explosion after a critical
mass accretion rate through the stalled shock has been reached. In the
two-dimensional simulation the preexplosion convective phase lasted
{\tilde}30 overturns ({\tilde}100 ms) before exploding. The preexplosion
steady state in two dimensions is similar to that achieved in one
dimension, but in two dimensions, owing to the longer dwell time of
matter in the overturning region, the average entropy achieved behind
the stalled shock is larger. In addition, the entropy gradient in the
convecting region is flatter. These effects, together with the
dynamical pressure of the buoyant plumes, serve to increase the steady
state shock radius (R_{s}) over its value in one dimension by
30\%-100\%. A large R_{s} enlarges the volume of the gain
region, puts shocked matter lower in the gravitational potential well,
and lowers the accretion ram pressure at the shock for a given
Mdot. The critical condition for explosion is thereby relaxed. Since
the ''escape'' temperature (T_{esc}) decreases with radius
faster than the actual matter temperature (T) behind the shock, a
larger R_{s} puts a larger fraction of the shocked material
above its local escape temperature. T {\gt} T_{esc} is the
condition for a thermally driven corona to lift off a star. In one,
two, or three dimensions, since supernovae are driven by neutrino
heating, they are coronal phenomena, akin to winds, though initially
bounded by an accretion ram. Neutrino radiation pressure is
unimportant.

We find that large and small eddies coexist, both before and after
explosion. In the unstable region before explosion, columnar downflows
are quasi-periodically formed and break up. These plumes excite
nonlinear internal g-modes that feed back onto the convection and
cause the plumes to meander over the neutrino- sphere. The radial
neutrino flux fluctuates with angle and time in response to the
anisotropic mass flux onto the neutrinospheres by as much as a factor
of 3. The boiling motion of the unstable region interior to the shock
is epitomized by neutrino-heated bubbles that rise and collide
episodically with the shock, whose radius oscillates in angle and time
by as much as 30\%. The angle-averaged neutrino luminosities vary by as
much as 60\% and decrease by a factor of 2 right after the explosion in
a characteristic way. 

The region interior to the neutrinosphere has weakly unstable lepton
and entropy gradients that drive persistent convective motions after
core bounce. However, the effects of this convection on the driving
neutrino luminosities seem dwarfed by the effects of convective
dredge-up and by the wildly varying accretion component. 

We see no evidence of a ''building'' or accumulation of energy before
explosion, save in the kinetic energy, in response to the decaying
accretion ram. In fact, the total energy in the overturning region
decreases steadily before explosion. In addition, we have noted a
nontrivial dependence on the neutrino transport algorithm. We would
eschew terms such as ''robust'' when referring to the effect of
convection on the outcome of collapse. 

Neutrino energy is pumped into the supernova during the shock's
propagation through the inner many thousands of kilometers and not
''instantaneously.''  Curiously, just after the explosion is triggered,
the matter that will eventually be ejected is still bound. In
addition, for a given asymptotic explosion energy, the amount of mass
that reaches explosive nucleosynthesis temperatures is less than
heretofore assumed. This may help to solve the ^{56}Ni
overproduction problem encountered in previous models of explosive
nucleosynthesis. 

The high-speed fingers that emerge from our model core seem a natural
explanation for the nickel bullets seen in SN 1987A and the shrapnel
inferred in some supernova remnants. In addition, the vigorous
convective motions interior to the shock can impart to the residue
recoil velocities and spins. The magnitudes of the former might be
within reach of the observed pulsar proper motions, but extensive new
calculations remain to be done to verify this. Within 100 ms of the
explosion, a strong, neutrino-driven wind is blowing outward from the
proto neutron star that clears the interior of mass and, while
operative, does not allow fallback. At the base of the rising
explosion plumes (in the early wind), a few high-entropy ({\tilde}60) clumps
are ejected, whose subsequent evolution may prove to be of relevance
to the r-process.

March 5 burst is presented. We identify the sources of these bursts with
neutron stars the external magnetic fields of which are much stronger
than those of ordinary pulsars. Several independent arguments point to a
neutron star with B\_dipole\~{}5x10\^{}14 G as the source of the March 5 event.
A very strong field can (i) spin down the star to an 8-s period in the
\~{}10\^{}4-yr age of the surrounding supernova remnant N49; (ii) provide
enough energy for the March 5 event; (iii) undergo a large-scale
interchange instability the growth time of which is comparable to the
\~{}0.2-s width of the initial hard transient phase of the March 5 event;
(iv) confine the energy that was radiated in the soft tail of that
burst; (v) reduce the Compton scattering cross-section sufficiently to
generate a radiative flux that is \~{}10\^{}4 times the (non-magnetic)
Eddington flux; (vi) decay significantly in \~{}10\^{}4-10\^{}5 yr, as is
required to explain the activity of soft gamma repeater sources on this
time-scale; and (vii) power the quiescent X-ray emission L\_X\~{}7x10\^{}35 erg
s\^{}-1 observed by Einstein and ROSAT as it diffuses the stellar interior.
We propose that the 1979 March 5 event was triggered by a large-scale
reconnection/interchange instability of the stellar magnetic field, and
the soft repeat bursts by cracking of the crust. The hard initial spike
of the March 5 event is identified with an expanding pair fireball, and
the soft tail of that burst, together with the short, soft repeat
bursts, with a pair plasma trapped in the stellar magnetosphere. We
construct a detailed radiative model that describes the cooling of such
a plasma. The opacity is dominated by the electron-baryon contaminant in
a cold surface layer, and the plasma releases energy as the edge of the
pair-dominated region propagates inward, in a cooling wave. The rate at
which the plasma volume contracts is limited either by the rate of
advection of heat toward the stellar surface (where the field is
strongest and the scattering opacity weakest), or by ablation of ions
and electrons from the stellar surface. The effective temperature of the
surface radiation depends only on the surface magnetic field strength in
the regime where the radiative flux is limited by ablation from the
neutron star surface (which is the regime of interest in the March 5
event), and otherwise is weakly dependent on the plasma energy density.
We argue that the deposition of equivalent energy in a much weaker
magnetic field (characteristic of ordinary pulsars) necessarily
generates a very high scattering depth which chokes off the radiative
flow on the observed \~{}0.1-s time-scale of soft gamma repeater bursts.
Indeed, we suggest that the same basic magnetospheric emission mechanism
operates at lower field strengths (B\~{}10\^{}12 G) in Type II X-ray bursts,
which have much lower luminosities than soft gamma repeater bursts.
Important magnetic radiative effects include the suppression of Compton
scattering in the extraordinary polarization mode, and stimulated photon
splitting. We derive the Boltzmann equations for the photon occupation
number which describe simulated photon splitting, as well as photon
merging. We show that the net splitting rate vanishes in thermal
equilibrium. Radiative diffusion occurs primarily in the E-mode,
although rapid scattering of the O-mode ensures convergence of the
photon distribution function to a Bose-Einstein form. This allows us to
write down diffusion equations for the photon energy flux and number
flux as linear superpositions of gradients in the temperature and
chemical potential. The transition from a Planck to a Bose-Einstein
spectrum occurs at T\~{}10 keV. Photon splitting at higher temperatures can
impede free-streaming of photons across the magnetic field lines, but
splitting of high-energy photons is impeded by the inverse process of
photon merging. We demonstrate that only a small fraction of the pair
bubble energy can be conducted into the crust during the lifetime of the
burst. We discuss the radiative ablation of matter from the heated
stellar surface after the magnetospheric pair plasma is dissipated. The
ensuing surface afterglow is typically \~{}1 per cent of the burst
luminosity. Direct pair neutrino cooling of the plasma is shown to be
unimportant for soft gamma repeater bursts, but may help to determine
the light curve of the March 5 event. Finally, we make a critical
comparison between this model and models in which the soft gamma
repeater bursts are triggered by accretion and/or involve surface
cooling.

 abstract = "{Interstellar scintillation (ISS), fluctuations in the amplitude and
phase of radio waves caused by scattering in the interstellar medium, is
important as a diagnostic of interstellar plasma turbulence. ISS is also
of interest because it is noise for other radio astronomical
observations. The unifying concern is the power spectrum of the
interstellar electron density. Here we use ISS observations through the
nearby (less than or approximately =1 kpc) (ISM) to estimate the
spectrum. From measurements of angular broadening of pulsars and
extragalactic sources, decorrelation bandwidth of pulsars, refractive
steering of features in pulsar dynamic spectra, dispersion measured
fluctuations of pulsars, and refractive scintillation index
measurements, we construct a composite structure function that is
approximately power law over 2 x 10^{6} m less than scale less
than 10^{13} m. The data are consistent with the structure
function having a logarithmic slope versus baseline less than 2; thus
there is a meaningful connection between scales in the radiowave
fluctuation field and the scales in the electron density field causing
the scattering. The data give an upper limit to the inner scale,
l_{o} less than or approximately 10^{8} m and are
consistent with much smaller values. We construct a composite electron
density spectrum that is approximately power law over at least the
approximately = 5 decade wavenumber range 10^{-13}/m less than
wavenumber less than 10^{-8}/m and that may extend to higher
wavenumbers. The average spectral index of electron density over this
wavenumber range is approximately = 3.7, very close to the value
expected for a Kolmogorov process. The outer scale size, L_{o},
must be greater than or approximately = 10^{13} m (determined
from dispersion measure fluctuations). When the ISS data are combined
with measurements of differential Faraday rotation angle, and gradients
in the average electron density, constraints can be put on the spectrum
at much smaller wave numbers. The composite spectrum is consistent with
a Kolmogorov-like power law over a huge range (10 or more decades) of
spatial wavenumber with an infrared outer scale L_{o} greater
than or approximately 10^{18}m. This power-law
subrange-expressed as ratio of outer to inner scales-is comparable to or
larger than that of other naturally occurring turbulent fluids, such as
the oceans or the solar wind. We outline some of the theories for
generating and maintaining such a spectrum over this huge wavenumber
range.

 abstract = "{We present a model that reproduces the basic spectral properties of
classical gammaray bursts with essentially no free parameters. It is an
elaboration of the scenario for cosmological gamma-ray bursts outlined
by Duncan {\amp} Thompson. The starting point is a
Poynting-flux-dominated, relativistic, MHD wind of extremely high
luminosity, L 1050 erg s- . The compactness parameter measured at the
base of the wind exceeds that of the Crab pulsar, or that of a luminous
AGN, by a factor of 1012. The wind emanates from a rapidly rotating
neutron star, or neutron disc, in which a poloidal field {\gt} 1014 G has
been generated by a helical dynamo. Scenarios that could produce such an
object include a failed Type Ib supernova, accretion-induced collapse of
a white dwarf, or perhaps a binary neutron star merger. The wind is
safely in the MHD limit as the result of neutrino-driven and
centrifugally driven mass loss. Mildly relativistic Alfven turbulence is
excited in the wind by reconnection, or by hydrodynamical instabilities
triggered by magnetic tension. Gamma-rays are generated via
Comptonization at moderate to high scattering depth. The amplitude of
the turbulence is itself limited by Compton drag, and the y-parameter of
the Alfven motions is regulated to a value near 114, with a weak
dependence on parameters such as radius, luminosity and the amount of
baryon loading. The resulting spectrum is a power law with spectral
index close to = -2 (VFv = constant), extending from an energy Ebreak -
1 (Ly/1050 erg S - 1)1/4 MeV (close to the spectral peak of a thermal
fireball carrying the same flux) up to an energy as high as - 10 meG2.
This power law steepens when the amplitude of the turbulence declines,
or when the turbulence is generated outside the scattering photosphere.
The spectrum below energy Ebreak is also a power law, with index a = -
1, which is cut off from below by stimulated scattering terms. Heavy
baryon loading causes much less adiabatic softening of the spectrum than
in thermal fireballs, so long as the Alfve'n turbulence is generated out
to the scattering photo sphere. We show explicitly that the broken power
law spectrum is an attractor, and that neither power law is altered by
relativistic corrections to the Kompane'ets equation (except near the
high-energy cut-off). The emergent gamma-ray spectrum is generated at a
distance as small as - 1 0 cm from the source, without the need for any
interaction with an external medium. Key words: MHD - radiation
mechanisms: non-thermal - radiative transfer - turbulence - stars:
neutron - gamma-rays: bursts.

made at the Arecibo Observatory for more than 7 and 8 year,
respectively, with uniform procedures and only a few modest gaps. On
each observing date we measure an equivalent pulse arrival time for PSR
B1855+09 at 1.4 GHz, with typical accuracies of about 0.8 micrometers
and for PSR B1937 + 21 at both 1.4 and 2.4 GHz, with accuracies around
0.2 micrometers. The pulse arrival times are fitted to a simple model
for each pulsar, yielding high-precision astrometric, rotational, and
orbital parameters, and a diverse range of conclusions. The celestial
coordinates and proper motions of the two pulsars are determined with
uncertainties less than or equal to 0.12 mas and less than or equal to
0.06 mas/year in the reference frame of the DE200 planetary ephemeris.
The annual parallaxes are found to be pi=1.1 +/- 0.3 mas and pi less
than 0.28 mas for PSRs B1855+09 and B1937+21, respectively. The general
relativistic Shapiro delay is measured in the PSR B1855+09 system and

_{-0.14} solar mass and m (sub2) = 0.258
^{+0.028}_{-0.016}solar mass for the pulsar and its
orbiting companion. The extremely stable orbital period of this system
provides a phenomenological limit on the secular change of Newton's
gravitational constant, dot-G/G=(-9 +/- 18) x 10^{-12}/year.
Variations in the dispersion measure of PSR B1937 + 21 indicate that the
spectrum of electron-density fluctuations in the interstellar medi um
has a power-law index beta = 3.874 +/- 0.011, slightly steeper than the
Kolmogorov value of 11/3, and we find no strong evidence for an 'inner
scale' greater than about 2 x 10^{9}cm. In the residual pulse
arrival times for PSR B1937+21 we have observed small systematic trends
not explained by our deterministic timing model. We discuss a number of
possible causes; although the results are not yet conclusive, the most
straightforward interpretation is that the unmodeled noise (a few
microseconds over 8 yr, or Delta t/T approximately equals
10^{-14} is inherent to the pulsar itself. In the present data
set, PSR B1855+09 exhibits no discernible timing noise. With
conventional assumptions we derive a limit Omega _{g}
h^{2} less than 6 x 10^{-8} (95\% confidence) for the
energy density, per logarithmic frequency interval, in a cosmic
background of stochastic gravitational waves. We discuss the feasibility
of establishing a pulsar-based timescale that might be used to test the
stabilities of the best available atomic clocks. In an Appendix, we
propose guidelines for the archiving of pulsar timing observations.

exceeding the maximum mass of a nonrotating neutron star. A supramassive
star evolves toward eventual catastrophic collapse to a black hole.
Prior to collapse, the star actually spins up as it loses angular

containing an accreting, magnetic, rapidly rotating white dwarf. These
stars are characterized by strong X-ray emission, high-excitation
spectra, and very stable optical and X-ray pulsations in their light
curves. There is considerable resemblance to their more famous cousins,
the AM Herculis stars, but the latter class is additionally
characterized by spin-orbit synchronism and the presence of strong
circular polarization. We list eighteen stars passing muster as certain
or very likely DQ Her stars. The rotational periods range from 33 s to
2.0 hr. Additional periods can result when the rotating searchlight
illuminates other structures in the binary. A single hypothesis explains
most of the observed properties: magnetically channeled accretion within
a truncated disk. Some accretion flow still seems to proceed directly to
the magnetosphere, however. The white dwarfs' magnetic moments are in
the range 10^{32} - 10^{34} G cc, slightly weaker than
in AM Her stars but with some probable overlap. The more important
reason why DQ Hers have broken synchronism is probably their greater
accretion rate and orbital separation. The observed
L_{x}/L_{V} values are surprisingly low for a radially
accreting white dwarf, suggesting that most of the accretion energy is
not radiated in a strong shock above the magnetic pole. The fluxes can
be more satisfactorily explained if most of the radial infall energy
manages to bypass the shock and deposit itse lf directly in the white
dwarf photosphere, where it should emerge as extreme ultraviolet (EUV)
radiation. This also provides an adequate source of ionizing photons to
power the high-excitation optical and UV emission lines. This is
probably the DQ Her analog to the famous 'soft X-ray excess' in AM Her
stars. However, unlike the AM Her case, this radiation has not been
directly observed, so the analogy must not (yet) be embraced too firmly.
There is some conventional wisdom today which segregates the
short-period from the long-period DQ Her stars. But the observational
grounds for this distinction are slim, except in one respect: X-ray
emission from short-period systems appears to be weaker and softer. This
must be due to the shallower depth of the potential well, and/or the
greater difficulty the fast rotators have in enforcing radial accretion
flow.

high magnetic Reynolds number dynamo, most of the magnetic energy
becomes concentrated in thin flux ropes when the field pressure exceeds

the possibilities for dynamo action during the various (pre-collapse)

 abstract = "{This is a revised edition of a classic and highly regarded book, first
published in 1981, describing the status of theory and experiment in
general relativity. This book offers a comprehensive survey of the
intensive research and testing of general relativity that has been
conducted over the past three decades.  As a foundation for this survey,
the book first introduces the important principles of gravitation
theory, developing the mathematical formalism that is necessary to carry
out specific computations so that theoretical predictions can be
compared with experimental findings.  It provides an up-to-date survey
of experimental results, not only for Einstein's ''classical'' tests, such
as deflection of light and the perihelion of Mercury, but also for new
solar-system tests, never envisioned by Einstein, that make use of the
high-precision space and laboratory technologies of today.  The book
goes on to explore new arenas for testing gravitation theory in black
holes, neutron stars, gravitational waves and cosmology. Included is a
systematic account of the remarkable ''binary pulsar'' PSR 1913+16, which
has yielded precise confirmation of the existence of gravitational
waves. A new chapter has been added to cover recent important
experimental tests, and the bibliography has been brought up to date.

that both an 'inner' and 'outer' hollow conal beam is emitted. The conal
emission radii of the five-component M pulsars exhibit a strikingly
orderly behavior. The 'inner' and 'outer' radii have the following
dependences at 1 GHz: 4.3 deg P exp -1/2 and 5.8 deg P exp -1/2,

  journal = {\physrep},
     year = 1991,
   volume = 203,
    pages = {1-124},
 abstract = "{We review the various ways in which binary pulsars, millisecond pulsars
and pulsars in globular clusters may have formed. To this end the
formation processes of neutron stars in interacting binaries, and the
subsequent evolution of such systems are discussed.

In section 2 the observed properties of radio pulsars, single as well as
in binaries, are briefly reviewed. The peculiar combination of rapid
spin and relatively weak magnetic fields of the binary and millisecond
pulsars and the high incidence of binaries among millisecond pulsars
strongly suggest that many of them (if not all) are old neutron stars
that have been ``recycled'' by the accretion of mass and angular
momentum from a companion star in a mass-transfer binary. Recycled
pulsars are expected to represent a later evolutionary phase of various
observed types of binary X-ray sources.

In section 3 the observed properties of the various types of binary
X-ray sources are summarized, and the evolutionary history of close
binary systems leading to the formation of X-ray binaries is reviewed.
In view of the relevance for the later evolution of X-ray binaries into
binary and millisecond pulsars, we discuss in this section also the
effect of various types of accretion (from a stellar wind, and by
Roche-lobe overflow) on the spin evolution of accreting magnetized
neutron stars. Subsequently the later evolution and final evolutionary
products of X-ray binaries are discussed. Massive X-ray binaries may in
the end either leave (i) a very close binary pulsar consisting of two
neutron stars (with an eccentric orbit) or a neutron star and a massive
white dwarf with a circular orbit, or (ii) two runaway pulsars, one
newborn and one recycled, or (iii) a single low-velocity recycled
pulsar. Low-mass X-ray binaries may either leave relatively wide
binaries with circular orbits consisting of a low-mass
(0.2-0.4M_{solar}) white dwarf and a recycled neutron star, or a
single recycled neutron star which has ``evaporated'' its companion
star, or possibly has merged with it. We also discuss in this section
the possible origin of the velocity-magnetic field correlation observed
in single radio pulsars. The correlation can be obtained by a
combination of close binary evolution and the occurrence of asymmetries
in supernova mass ejection or, alternatively, by a combination of close
binary evolution and the evaporation of low-mass companions to young
pulsars.

Section 4 is devoted to the special formation and evolution processes of
close neutron star binaries that operate in globular star clusters. The
high incidence of pulsars (mostly binary and/or millisecond pulsars) in
globular clusters and the origin of the relatively large fraction ({\gt}\~{}
50\%) of single pulsars among them is discussed. From the discussions in
section 4 and section 5 it is concluded that so far no clear evidence -
nor the need - for the formation of neutron stars (millisecond pulsars)
by the accretion-induced collapse of white dwarfs in globular clusters
has been presented, although this formation mechanism cannot be
excluded. For the formation of low-mass X-ray binaries in the galactic
disk this mechanism, however, may make a significant contribution.

In section 5 the statistical properties of the binary and millisecond
pulsars in globular clusters and in the general field are discussed in
relation to the evolution of neutron star magnetic fields. The following
conclusions are drawn:

(i) There is no longer clear evidence that the magnetic fields of
isolated neutron stars (radio pulsars) do decay.

(ii) Neutron stars that have been recycled by accretion in close
binaries do show clear evidence for magnetic field decay. This field
decay may be due to either (a) the accretion process itself or (b) the
spin evolution of the neutron stars in binaries which has affected the
magnetic field carried by the liquid interior of the neutron star.

(iii) A sizeable fraction of all observed single radio pulsars (of order
several tens of per cent) may have been recycled in (mostly massive)
close binaries. The presence of this group in the general pulsar
population may have created the impression that the magnetic fields of
single neutron stars do decay.

In section 6 the findings of earlier sections are summarized and some
open problems are listed.

The results are then applied to a large population of core-single,

Core-component widths are intimately related to the polar-cap geometry
at the stellar surface. A simple mathematical expression, established
through the study of two-pole interpulsars, indicates that the
core-component widths depend only upon the pulsar period and alpha, the
angle between the rotation and magnetic axes of the star. The
relationship can then be used to estimate alpha in any pulsar with a
core component. Values of alpha are estimated for about 110 core single
(St), triple (T), and five-component (M) pulsars. These results have
important implications for the nature of the core radiation process.
Core emission appears to come essentially from the stellar surface,
filling the entire polar-cap 'gap' region where particle acceleration is
thought to take place.

nonvanishing poloidal current approaches a cylindrical structure. For
singular solutions or those with a vanishing poloidal current, the

adapted to study the evolution of a photon (axion, graviton) beam in the
presence of external fields. We apply our results to discuss the
possibility of detecting axions by a measurement of the magnetically
induced birefringence of the vacuum. We also discuss photon-axion
(graviton) transitions in pulsar magnetic fields. The QED-induced
nonlinearity of Maxwell's equations causes magnetic birefringence
effects which are much stronger than the axion-induced effects in the
range of axion parameters allowed by astrophysical constraints. Also,
this QED effect induces an index of refraction for photons in vacuum
which is so large near pulsars that photon-axion (graviton) transitions
are strongly suppressed. However, this QED effect can be canceled by
plasma refractive effects, leading to degeneracy between photons and
axions so that resonant transitions can occur in analogy with the
Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein effect. The adiabatic condition can be met
only in spatially extended systems, possibly in the magnetosphere of
magnetic white dwarfs. Our conclusions differ substantially from several
recent discussions of various aspects of these mixing phenomena.

high-frequency waves can become unstable with respect to the
electron-mass modulation and the excitation of low-frequency density
fluctuations. The nonlinear equations which govern the evolution of the
modulationally unstable waves are derived. The phenomena of soliton
formation, radiation collapse, and profile modification are
investigated. Finite amplitude theories of the envelope solitons are
reviewed. In a multidimensional situation, the electromagnetic waves can
undergo self-focusing. The use of the variational methods allows one to
calculate the nonlinear wavenumber and radius of the self-focused laser
beams. Analytical solutions for the self-trapped radiation and the
three-dimensional relativistic solitons are obtained. It is found that
magnetized plasmas can support the propagation of new types of
ultrarelativistic electromagnetic waves. The modulational instability of
the latter is analyzed. Furthermore, it is shown that the relativistic
ponderomotive force in a magnetized plasma can produce large amplitude
field-aligned electrostatic potentials which can effectively accelerate
particles to very high energies. Finally, we consider the nonlinear
propagation of intense electromagnetic waves in electron-positron
plasmas. Possible applications in inertial fusion, beat-wave particle
accelerator, rf heating of magnetically confined plasmas, and pulsar

of rapidly spinning magnetized neutron stars is limited by e1
production. In the Vela pulsar a pair of e + and e - created within the
gap (primaries) are accelerated in opposite directions to extreme
relativistic energies. The primary e - /e + produce primary y-rays
through inverse Compton scattering on IR photons. Primary y-rays are
sufficiently energetic to produce (secondary) e1 pairs in collisions
with this same IR photon flux. Secondary synchrotron radiation by these
pairs gives crossed fan beams of y-rays and weaker ones of X-rays.
Collisions of the hard secondary y-rays with the secondary crossed beam
soft X-rays give a large flux of lower energy e -+ (tertiary) pairs
which fill much of the outer magnetosphere. It is the (tertiary) IR
synchrotron radiation from tertiary pairs through the outer gap which
initiates the entire series of pair production processes. For Vela, the
calculated observable consequences include (a) twin cusped y-ray pulses
with photon spectrum F(w) -3/2 ln (3 GeV/hco) from 3 GeV to about 102
KeV; (b) total fan beam radiated power 10-2 the pulsar spin-down energy
loss rate; (c) an X-ray spectrum F(o) 2/3 below 102 KeV; (d) weak, more
closely spaced twin optical pulses from the tertiary radiation with
power 10- that of the secondary y-rays; (e) and e-+ outflow of 1036 s';
(f) a double pulse of 10' eV y-rays with about 10-2 the y-ray power.
Model Crab pulsar emissions are considered with emphasis on differences
from those of Vela. Crab primary outer gap e+/e lose most of their
energy to curvature y-rays, which convert to e pairs in collisions with
X-rays. These X-rays come from the synchrotron (secondary) emission from
such (secondary) pairs created beyond the gap boundary. Inverse Compton
scattering of secondary e -+ on the secondary X-rays boosts a fraction
to y-rays. The combination of secondary synchrotron and inverse Compton
emission into twin fan beams gives the Crab pulsar spectrum from optical
to GeV energies. Other mechanisms give the Crab's double pulsed radio

bulk properties of nuclear matter; the saturation binding and density,
compressibility, and charge symmetry energy. The cores of the heavier
neutron stars are found to be dominated by hyperons, and the total
hyperon population for such stars is 15 percent-20 percent, depending on
whether pions condense or not. The -meson, which contributes to the
isospin symmetry energy, has an important influence on the baryon
populations. Lepton populations are strongly suppressed and charge
neutrality is achieved among the hadrons. A possible consequence for the
decay time of the magnetic field of pulsars and hence for their active
lifetime is mentioned.

 abstract = "{Pulse arrival times of a binary pulsar were observed for seven years
using average pulse profiles representing about five minutes of data
acquisition with synchronous averaging and a least squares procedure for
fitting the standard profiles. A model was formulated using relativistic
terms, both secular and periodically varying with orbital phase, and it
was assumed that the pulsar is an accurate clock. Tests were made to
determine the magnitude of possible systematic biases. The component
masses and absolute size of the orbit were determined. These values were
used, together with the well-determined orbital period and eccentricity,
to calculate the rate at which the orbital period should decay as energy
is lost from the system via gravitational radiation. The results agreed
strikingly with general relativity but disagreed with most other
theories of gravitation. For this reason, the companion star must be a
neutron star or black hole.

magnitude less than the expected number of neutron stars and black holes
in binary systems. It is shown in the paper that the main condition for
the appearance of X-ray source in a binary system including relativistic
star is that the size of the normal component must be close to size of
its critical Roche lobe. In the case of accretion of the stellar wind
matter in detached binary system the specific angular momentum of the
matter captured by the relativistic star is small. Therefore the
accreting disk is not formed around relativistic star. Consequently, a
black hole in detached binary system can not be strong X-ray source (no
matter how strong the stellar wind might be). In this case the accretion
is spherically-symmetric and black hole is the source of hard X-ray and
y-ray radiation. Young neutron star in detached system is ejecting
pulsar, radiating in X-ray spectral band, like the Crab pulsar. Its
radioemission is absorbed in stellar wind plasma due to free-free
processes. Deceleration of the pulsar rotation and connected decrease of
its luminosity makes possible the penetration of the ambient plasma
inside light cylinder. This may lead to the switching off of the pulsar
mechanism. However rapidly rotating magnetosphere of the neutron star
throws away the falling matter, preventing the accretion. The rotation,
consequently, continues to decelerate. Only after sufficient
deceleration of neutron star rotation the accretion becomes possible and
neutron star will be the X-ray source. However the estimates show that
the deceleration time up to this stage exceeds the evolutionary time of
the normal component. Only in the extremely close binaries having
anomalously strong accreting matter flow it is possible for the
magnetized neutron star to convert into the X-ray sources. For the same
reason old single pulsars with strong magnetic field never become the
sources of ultra-violet and soft X-ray radiation. Key words: black holes
and neutron stars accretion X-ray sources pulsars

hole or {\lsquo}collapsar{\rsquo}. The straightforward assumptions (1)
that the gas content of the galaxy decreases exponentially with time to
its present level of {\tilde}5\% and (2) that the luminosity function
characteristic of young clusters and the solar neighborhood is
appropriate throughout galactic history, lead to the prediction that
{\ap} 20\% of the unevolved stars of approximately one solar mass (M
_{ȯ}) in the galaxy today should have metal
compositionsZ{\lsim}0.1Z _{ȯ}. As Schmidt has argued from
similar reasoning, this is quite inconsistent with current observations;
an early generation dominated by more massive stars{\mdash}which would by
now have evolved{\mdash}is suggested by this difficulty. Many of these
massive stars, according to our assumptions, will end their lives as
collapsed black hole remnants. It is difficult to visualize an epoch of
massive star formation in the collapsing gas cloud which formed our
galaxy which would enrich the gas rapidly enough to account for the
level of heavy element abundances in halo population stars; we have
therefore proposed a stage of star formation which is entirely
pregalactic in character. We suggest that the Jeans' length-sized
initial condensations in the expanding universe discussed by Peebles and
Dicke may provide the appropriate setting for this first generation of
stars. Guided by these considerations, and by the need for a substantial
quantity of {\lsquo}unseen{\rsquo} mass to bind our local group of
galaxies, we have constructed a model of the galaxy in which this
violent early phase of massive star formation produces both (1)
approximately 25\% of the level of heavy elements observed in the solar
system and (2) an enormous unseen mass in the form of black holes. The
implications of our model for other features of the galaxy, including
supernova nucleosynthesis, the cosmic ray production of the light
elements, and cosmochronology, are discussed in detail.

 abstract = "{The model comprises a rotating neutron star (R 106 cm) with a strong
magnetic field (B 1012 gauss). Magnetic-field lines which reach the
light cylinder are open field lines which connect to the surface of the
star at the ''polar caps.'' Each polar cap contains two zones, an electron
polar zone (EPZ) and a proton polar zone (PPZ) from which electrons and
protons, respectively, stream from the star. Acceleration of each stream
is effected close to the surface of the star. Primary electrons in the
EPZ follow magnetic-field lines; this acceleration leads to -radiation.
It is found that, if the period T is less than 1 sec, these -rays
annihilate to produce electron-positron pairs. Steady flow is then
impossible, but flow comprising a sequence of charge sheets seems
possible. These charge sheets produce radio emission. This may explain
why most pulsars have periods shorter than 1 sec. If the sheets are
thin, the spectrum varies as -5/3 and provides a good fit to the
luminosity spectrum of CP 1919. If the sheet has a rectangular current
distribution, the spectrum varies as p '1/3 and provides a good fit to
the radio luminosity spectrum of the Crab pulsar. In each EPZ of the
Crab pulsar, -ray emission and pair creation combine in a cascade. The
resulting flux of electrons and positrons from the star is of order 1041
. The secondary electrons and positrons radiate by the synchrotron
mechanism to yield a -1I2 spectrum, but the radiation is self-absorbed
in the X-ray part of the spectrum and cannot explain the optical
radiation from the Crab pulsar. The Crab pulsar spins rapidly enough for
pair production to occur at the PPZs also, apparently out to several
times R. In consequence, synchrotron radiation from the
electron-positron flux is self-absorbed at much lower frequencies. It
seems that the optical and X-ray radiation from the Crab pulsar can be
understood quantitatively in this way. The optical, X-ray, and -ray flux
expected from this model of the Crab pulsar can be reconciled with
observation if the rotation axis, dipole axis, and line of sight are so
related that we receive radiation from both PPZs but no radiation from
the EPZs.

pulsar observations based upon the magnetic-dipole model presented in
the first paper in this series. Applying this formalism to the extant

observations are consistent with the magnetic-dipole model and a
''turnoff'' time of about 4 X 106 years. The observed pulsars have an
average age of approximately 2 X 106 years. The distribution of periods
(in particular, the lack of long-period objects) can be quantitatively
understood. 2. If we assume that the pulsar emission is in the form of a
rotating pencil beam, then we observe between one4ourth and one-sixth of
bright nearby objects. 3. The present birth rate is near 5 X 10-' , or
one per 30 years in the Galaxy. 4. The average scale height for the
distribution above the plane is about 120 pc. The data, however, suggest
that young objects are concentrated to the plane much more strongly than
the old ones; this, together with the known anomalous space motion of
the Crab object, leads us to conclude tentatively that most pulsars
receive a velocity averaging 100 km at birth, and the initial scale
height is about 80pc. 5. The derived bfrth rate and scale height are
consistent with the statement that all or most stars more massive than
about 4 M0 become pulsars at death. The scale height is inconsistent
with the progenitors being much less massive objects, and the number of
objects is inconsistent with them being much more massive ones. The
population identification makes the association of pulsar formation with
T 'pe II supernova events very plausible. 6. With these results we
consider the evolution of the nuclear region of the Galaxy and conclude
that during its early history it might have been a small non thermal
source with a total luminosity between that of Seyfert nuclei and QSOs,
fluctuating on a time scale of approximately 1 year.

extremely efficient at accelerating charged particles to relativistic

extreme cases the ac- celeration mechanism can produce protons with

The particles in the region threaded by those field lines which close

escape along these lines and are electrostatically accelerated up to

the holes experience a frame-dragging-induced acceleration orthogonal to
the plane of their spins and their infall ({\ldquo}downward{\rdquo}), and
they reach downward speeds of order 1000km/s. When the common apparent
horizon forms (and when the event horizons merge and their merged neck
expands), the horizon swallows upward field momentum that resided
between the holes, causing the merged hole to accelerate in the opposite

energy and momentum settle down, a pulsational burst of gravitational
waves is emitted, and the merged hole has a final effective velocity of
about 20km/s upward, which agrees with the recoil velocity obtained by
measuring the linear momentum carried to infinity by the emitted
gravitational radiation. To investigate the gauge dependence of our

are no longer present. However, we show that the gas can become unstable
to a standing, eccentric disc or a single-armed spiral mode (m = 1), in
which the stars and gas precess at different rates, driving the gas to
sub-pc scales (again for sufficiently gas-rich, disc-dominated systems).
A proper treatment of this mode requires including star formation and
the self-gravity of both the stars and gas (which has not been the case
in many previous calculations). Our simulations predict a correlation
between the BH accretion rate and the star formation rate at different
galactic radii. We find that nuclear star formation is more tightly
coupled to active galactic nucleus activity than the global star
formation rate of a galaxy, but a reasonable correlation remains even
for the latter.

in three (one major, two minor) gas-rich galaxy merger remnants that
were previously simulated at high resolution, and in which the pairing
of the MBHs had been shown to be successful. We run new simulations of
MBHs recoiling in the major merger remnant with Mach numbers in the
range 1{\lt}M{\lt}6, and use simulation data to construct a
semi-analytical model for the orbital evolution of MBHs in gas-rich
systems. We show that: 1) in major merger remnants the energy deposited
by the moving hole into the rotationally supported, turbulent medium
makes a negligible contribution to the thermodynamics of the gas. This
contribution becomes significant in minor merger remnants, potentially
allowing for an electromagnetic signature of MBH recoil; 2) in major
merger remnants, the combination of both deeper central potential well
and drag from high-density gas confines even MBHs with kick velocities
as high as 1200 km/s within 1 kpc from the host's center; 3)
kinematically offset nuclei may be observable for timescales of a few
Myr in major merger remnants in the case of recoil velocities in the
range 700-1,000 km/s; 4) in minor mergers remnants the effect of gas
drag is weaker, and MBHs with recoil speeds in the range 300-600 km/s
will wander through the host halo for longer timescales. When accounting
for the probability distribution of kick velocities, however, we find
that the likelihood of observing recoiling MBHs in gas-rich galaxy
mergers is very low, typically below 10\^{}-5 - 10\^{}-6.

through feedback by active galactic nuclei (AGN). The creation of the
scaling relations can be fully explained by the hierarchical assembly of
black hole and stellar mass through galaxy merging, from an initially
uncorrelated distribution of BH and stellar masses in the early
Universe. We show this with a suite of dark matter halo merger trees for
which we make assumptions about (uncorrelated) black hole and stellar
mass values at early cosmic times. We then follow the halos in the
presence of global star formation and black hole accretion recipes that
(i) work without any coupling of the two properties per individual
galaxy and (ii) correctly reproduce the observed star formation and
black hole accretion rate density in the Universe. With disk-to-bulge
conversion in mergers included, our simulations even create the observed
slope of \~{}1.1 for the M\_BH-M\_bulge-relation at z=0. This also implies
that AGN feedback is not a required (though still a possible) ingredient

generally, the observations will enable testing general relativity in

therefore of paramount importance. As an essential step toward this

signatures correlated with GWs can arise in merging systems as a
consequence of shocks and accretion combined with the effect of
relativistic beaming. The most striking EM variability is observed for
systems where spins are aligned with the orbital axis and where orbiting
black holes form a stable set of density wakes, but all systems exhibit
some characteristic signatures that can be utilized in searches for EM
counterparts. In the case of the most massive binaries observable by the

to compute spacetime dynamics in almost complete generality, allowing us
to model the coalescence and merger of binary black holes with
essentially no approximations. The primary limitation of these
calculations is now computational. In particular, it is difficult to
model systems with large mass ratio and large spins, since one must
accurately resolve the multiple length scales that play a role in such
systems. Perturbation theory can play an important role in extending the
reach of computational modeling for binary systems. In this paper, we
present first results of a code that allows us to model the
gravitational waves generated by the inspiral, merger, and ringdown of a
binary system in which one member of the binary is much more massive
than the other. This allows us to accurately calibrate binary dynamics
in the large mass ratio regime. We focus in this analysis on the recoil
imparted to the merged remnant by these waves. We closely examine the
{\ldquo}antikick,{\rdquo} an antiphase cancellation of the recoil arising
from the plunge and ringdown waves, described in detail by Schnittman 
We find that, for orbits aligned with the black hole spin, the antikick
grows as a function of spin. The total recoil is smallest for prograde
coalescence into a rapidly rotating black hole, and largest for
retrograde coalescence. Amusingly, this completely reverses the
predicted trend for kick versus spin from analyses that only include
inspiral information.

these separations is well described by post-Newtonian equations of

distribution of spin orientations at separations r{\sime}10M where
numerical-relativity simulations typically begin. Although isotropic
spin distributions at r{\sime}1000M remain isotropic at r{\sime}10M,
distributions that are initially partially aligned with the orbital

post-Newtonian inspiral. Spin precession tends to align (antialign) the
binary black hole spins with each other if the spin of the more massive
black hole is initially partially aligned (antialigned) with the orbital
angular momentum, thus increasing (decreasing) the average final spin.
Spin precession is stronger for comparable-mass binaries and could
produce significant spin alignment before merger for both supermassive
and stellar-mass black hole binaries. We also point out that precession
induces an intrinsic accuracy limitation ({\lsim}0.03 in the

estimate the phase and amplitude errors in the numerical waveforms and
then minimize the difference between numerical and EOB waveforms by
calibrating a handful of EOB-adjustable parameters. In the equal-mass,
spin aligned case, we find that phase and fractional amplitude
differences between the numerical and EOB (2,2) mode can be reduced to
0.01 radian and 1\%, respectively, over the entire inspiral waveforms. In
the equal-mass, spin antialigned case, these differences can be reduced

10\% during merger and ringdown. The waveform agreement is within
numerical errors in the spin aligned case while slightly over numerical
errors in the spin antialigned case. Using Enhanced LIGO and Advanced

and magnitudes
|S{\rarr}_{1}/m_{1}^{2}|=|S{\rarr}_{2}/m_{2}^{2}|=0.97
for different mass ratios, where S{\rarr}_{i} and m_{i}
are the spin-angular momentum and mass of the ith black hole. Starting
from a fiducial initial separation of R_{i}=50M, we perform
3.5-post-Newtonian-order evolutions down to a separation of
R_{f}=5M, where M=m_{1}+m_{2}, the total mass of
the system. At this final fiducial separation, we compute the angular
distribution of the spins with respect to the final orbital angular
momentum, L{\rarr}. We perform 16^{4}=65536 simulations for six
mass ratios between q=1 and q=1/16 and compute the distribution of the
angles L{\rarr}\^{}{\middot}{$\Delta$}{\rarr}\^{} and L{\rarr}\^{}{\middot}S{\rarr}\^{},
directly related to recoil velocities and total angular momentum. We
find a small but statistically significant bias of the distribution
towards counteralignment of both scalar products. A post-Newtonian
analysis shows that radiation-reaction-driven dissipative effects on the
orbital angular momentum lead to this bias. To study the merger of
black-hole binaries, we turn to full numerical techniques. In order to
make use of the numerous simulations now available in the literature, we
introduce empirical formulas to describe the final remnant black-hole
mass, spin, and recoil velocity for merging black-hole binaries with
arbitrary mass ratios and spins. Our formulas are based on the
post-Newtonian scaling, to model the plunge phase, with amplitude
parameters chosen by a least-squares fit of recently available fully
nonlinear numerical simulations, supplemented by inspiral losses from
infinity to the innermost stable circular orbit. We then evaluate those
formulas for randomly chosen directions of the individual spins and
magnitudes as well as the binary{\rsquo}s mass ratio. The number of
evaluations has been chosen such that there are 10 configurations per
each dimension of this parameter space, i.e. 10^{7}. We found
that the magnitude of the recoil velocity distribution decays
exponentially as P(v){\tilde}exp{\func}(-v/2500kms^{-1}) with mean
velocity {\mlab}v{\mrab}=630kms^{-1} and standard deviation
{\mlab}v^{2}{\mrab}-{\mlab}v{\mrab}^{2}=534kms^{-1},
leading to a 23\% probability of recoils larger than
1000kms^{-1}, and a highly peaked angular distribution along the
final orbital axis. The studies of the distribution of the final
black-hole spin magnitude show a universal distribution highly peaked at
S_{f}/m_{f}^{2}=0.73 and a 25{\deg} misalignment
with respect to the final orbital angular momentum, just prior to full
merger of the holes. We also compute the statistical dependence of the
magnitude of the recoil velocity with respect to the ejection angle. The
spin and recoil velocity distributions are also displayed as a function
of the mass ratio. Finally, we compute the effects of the observer
orientation with respect to the recoil velocity vector to take into
account the probabilities to measure a given redshifted (or blueshifted)
radial velocity of accretion disks with respect to host galaxies.

If such a merger takes place in a gaseous environment, there is a
possibility of a simultaneous detection of electromagnetic and
gravitational radiation, as the stirring, shock heating, and accretion
of the gas may produce variability and enhancements in the
electromagnetic flux. Such a simultaneous detection can provide a wealth
of opportunities to study gravitational physics, accretion physics, and
cosmology. We investigate this scenario by performing fully
general-relativistic, hydrodynamic simulations of merging, equal-mass,
nonspinning black hole-black hole binaries embedded in gas clouds.
We evolve the metric using the Baumgarte-Shapiro-Shibata-Nakamura
formulation with standard moving puncture gauge conditions and handle
the hydrodynamics via a high-resolution shock-capturing scheme. We
consider both {\ldquo}binary Bondi accretion{\rdquo} in which the binary

Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion{\rdquo} in which the binary moves
relative to the gas cloud. The gas cloud is assumed to be homogeneous
far from the binary and governed by a {$\Gamma$}-law equation of state. We
vary {$\Gamma$} between 4/3 and 5/3. For each simulation, we compute the
gas flow and accretion rate and estimate the electromagnetic luminosity
due to bremsstrahlung and synchrotron emission. We find evidence for
significant enhancements in both the accretion rate and luminosity over
values for a single black hole of the same mass as the binary. We
estimate that this luminosity enhancement should be detectable by the
Large Synoptic Survey Telescope for a 10^{6}M_{ȯ}

 abstract = "{As one step towards a systematic modeling of the electromagnetic (EM)
emission from an inspiralling black hole binary we consider a simple
scenario in which the binary moves in a uniform magnetic field anchored
to a distant circumbinary disc. We study this system by solving the
Einstein-Maxwell equations in which the EM fields are chosen with
strengths consistent with the values expected astrophysically and
treated as test fields. Our initial data consists of a series of
binaries with spins aligned or antialigned with the orbital angular
momentum and we study the dependence of gravitational and EM signals
with different spin configurations. Overall we find that the EM
radiation in the lowest {\ell}=2, m=2 multipole accurately reflects the
gravitational one, with identical phase evolutions and amplitudes that
differ only by a scaling factor. This is no longer true when considering
higher {\ell} modes, for which the amplitude evolution of the scaled EM
emission is slightly larger, while the phase evolutions continue to
agree. We also compute the efficiency of the energy emission in EM waves
and find that it scales quadratically with the total spin and is given
by
E_{EM}^{rad}/M{\sime}10^{-15}(M/10^{8}M_{ȯ})^{2}(B/10^{4}G)^{2},
hence 13 orders of magnitude smaller than the gravitational energy for
realistic magnetic fields. Although large in absolute terms, the
corresponding luminosity is much smaller than the accretion luminosity
if the system is accreting at near the Eddington rate. Most importantly,
this EM emission is at frequencies of
{\tilde}10^{-4}(10^{8}M_{ȯ}/M)Hz, which are
well outside those accessible to astronomical radio observations. As a
result, it is unlikely that the EM emission discussed here can be
detected directly and simultaneously with the gravitational-wave one.
However, indirect processes, driven by changes in the EM fields behavior
could yield observable events. In particular we argue that if the
accretion rate of the circumbinary disc is small and sufficiently stable
over the timescale of the final inspiral, then the EM emission may be
observable indirectly as it will alter the accretion rate through the
magnetic torques exerted by the distorted magnetic field lines.

angular momentum. As the black hole mass grows, its spin changes in
strength and direction due to its gravito-magnetic coupling with the
small-scale accretion disc. We find that the black hole spins loose
memory of their initial orientation, as accretion torques suffice to
align the spins with the angular momentum of their orbit on a short
time-scale ({\lt}\~{}1-2 Myr). A residual off-set in the spin direction
relative to the orbital angular momentum remains, at the level of
{\lt}\~{}10{\deg} for the case of a cold disc, and {\lt}\~{}30{\deg} for a warmer
disc. Alignment in a cooler disc is more effective due to the higher
coherence of the accretion flow near each black hole that reflects the
large-scale coherence of the disc's rotation. If the massive black holes
coalesce preserving the spin directions set after formation of a
Keplerian binary, the relic black hole resulting from their coalescence
receives a relatively small gravitational recoil. The distribution of

if the recoiling black hole is surrounded by a thin circumbinary disc.
Our results differ significantly from those of previous investigations.
We show analytically that the dominant source of energy is often
potential energy, released as gas in the outer disc attempts to
circularize at smaller radii. Thus, dimensional estimates, that include
only the kinetic energy gained by the disc gas, underestimate the real
energy loss. This underestimate can exceed an order of magnitude, if the
recoil is directed close to the disc plane. We use three dimensional
smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations and two-dimensional
finite difference simulations to verify our analytic estimates. We also
compute the bolometric light curve, which is found to vary strongly
depending upon the kick angle. A prompt emission signature due to this
mechanism may be observable for low-mass
(10^{6}M_{solar}) black holes whose recoil velocities
exceed \~{}10^{3} km s^{-1}. Emission at earlier times can
mainly result from the response of the disc to the loss of mass, as the

orbital angular momentum, and which therefore do not exhibit precession
effects, provide the natural ground to start detailed studies of the
influence of strong-field spin effects on gravitational-wave
observations of coalescing binaries. Furthermore, such systems may be
the preferred end state of the inspiral of generic supermassive binary
black-hole systems. In view of this, we have computed the inspiral and
merger of a large set of binary systems of equal-mass black holes with
spins parallel to the orbital angular momentum but otherwise arbitrary.
Our attention is particularly focused on the gravitational-wave emission
so as to quantify how much spin effects contribute to the
signal-to-noise ratio, to the horizon distances, and to the relative
event rates for the representative ranges in masses and detectors. As
expected, the signal-to-noise ratio increases with the projection of the
total black-hole spin in the direction of the orbital momentum. We find
that equal-spin binaries with maximum spin aligned with the orbital
angular momentum are more than {\ldquo}3 times as loud{\rdquo} as the
corresponding binaries with anti-aligned spins, thus corresponding to
event rates up to 30 times larger. We also consider the waveform
mismatch between the different spinning configurations and find that,
within our numerical accuracy, binaries with opposite spins
S_{1}=-S_{2} cannot be distinguished, whereas binaries
with spin S_{1}=S_{2} have clearly distinct
gravitational-wave emissions. Finally, we derive a simple expression for
the energy radiated in gravitational waves and find that the binaries
always have efficiencies E_{rad}/M{\gsim}3.6\%, which can become
as large as E_{rad}/M{\sime}10\% for maximally spinning binaries
with spins aligned with the orbital angular momentum. These binaries are
therefore among the most efficient sources of energy in the Universe.

bulge-dominated, the M _{BH}-M _{*,bulge} relation has
not evolved since z \~{} 1.4. However, (2) since we have evidence for
substantial disk components, the bulges of massive galaxies (M
_{*,total} = 11.1 {\plusmn} 0.3 or log M _{BH} \~{} 8.3
{\plusmn} 0.2) must have grown over the last 9 Gyr predominantly by
redistribution of the disk into the bulge mass. Since all necessary
stellar mass exists in galaxies at z = 1.4, no star formation or
addition of external stellar material is required, but only a
redistribution, e.g., induced by minor and major merging or through disk
instabilities. Merging, in addition to redistributing mass in the
galaxy, will add both BH and stellar/bulge mass, but does not change the
overall final M _{BH}/M _{*,bulge} ratio. Since the
overall cosmic stellar and BH mass buildup trace each other tightly over
time, our scenario of bulge formation in massive galaxies is independent
of any strong BH feedback and means that the mechanism coupling BH and
bulge mass until the present is very indirect.

in reasonable agreement with the simulations, they neglect the
precession of the binary's orbital plane, and cannot therefore be
applied directly{\mdash}i.e., without evolving the system to small
separations using post-Newtonian theory{\mdash}to binaries with
separations larger than a few hundred gravitational radii. While not a
problem in principle, this may be impractical if the formulas are
employed in cosmological merger trees or N-body simulations, which
provide the spins and angular momentum of the two black holes when their
separation is of hundreds or thousands of gravitational radii. The
formula that we propose is instead built on improved assumptions and
gives, for any separation, a very accurate prediction both for the norm
of the final spin and for its direction. By comparing with the numerical
data, we also show that the final-spin direction is very accurately
aligned with the binary's total angular momentum at large separation.
Hence, observations of the final-spin direction (e.g., via a jet) can
provide information on the binary's orbital plane at large separations

concern has been that gravitational radiation would drain angular
momentum so rapidly that generic orbits would circularize before
zoom-whirl behavior could play out, and only rare highly tuned orbits
would retain their imprint. Using full numerical relativity, we catch
zoom-whirl behavior despite dissipation. The larger the mass ratio, the
longer the pair can spend in orbit before merging and therefore the more
zooms and whirls seen. Larger spins also enhance zoom whirliness. An
important implication is that these eccentric orbits can merge during a
whirl phase, before enough angular momentum has been lost to truly
circularize the orbit. Waveforms will be modulated by the harmonics of
zoom-whirls, showing quiet phases during zooms and louder glitches
during whirls.

Taniguchi, Phys. Rev. DPRVDAQ1550-7998 73, 064027
(2006).10.1103/PhysRevD.73.064027]. We prepare binary neutron stars with
a large initial orbital separation and employ the moving-puncture
formulation, which enables one to follow merger and ringdown phases for
a long time, even after black hole formation. For modeling inspiraling
neutron stars, which should be composed of cold neutron stars, the
Akmal-Pandharipande-Ravenhall (APR) equation of state (EOS) is adopted.
After the onset of merger, the hybrid-type EOS is used; i.e., the cold
and thermal parts are given by the APR and {$\Gamma$}-law EOSs,
respectively. Three equal-mass binaries, each with mass
1.4M_{ȯ}, 1.45M_{ȯ}, and
1.5M_{ȯ}, and two unequal-mass binaries with mass, 1.3 vs
1.6M_{ȯ} and 1.35 vs 1.65M_{ȯ}, are prepared.
We focus primarily on the black hole formation case, and explore mass
and spin of the black hole, mass of disks which surround the black hole,
and gravitational waves emitted during the black hole formation. We find
that (i) the black hole is promptly formed if total mass of the system
initially satisfies m_{0}{\gsim}2.9M_{ȯ}; (ii) for
the systems of m_{0}=2.9-3.0M_{ȯ} and of mass
ratio {\ap}0.8, the mass of disks which surround the formed black hole is
0.006-0.02M_{ȯ}; (iii) the spin of the formed black
hole is 0.78{\plusmn}0.02 when a black hole is formed after the merger in
the dynamical time scale. This value depends weakly on the total mass
and mass ratio, and is about 0.1 larger than that of a black hole formed
from nonspinning binary black holes; (iv) for the black hole formation
case, Fourier spectrum shape of gravitational waves emitted in the
merger and ringdown phases has a universal qualitative feature
irrespective of the total mass and mass ratio, but quantitatively, the
spectrum reflects the parameters of the binary neutron stars.

stationary configuration by the emission of gravitational radiation.
Such a perturbation will occur, for example, in the coalescence of a
black hole binary, following their inspiral and subsequent merger. At
late times the waveform is a superposition of quasinormal modes, which
we refer to as the ringdown. The dominant mode is expected to be the
fundamental mode, l=m=2. Since this is a well-known waveform, matched
filtering can be implemented to search for this signal using LIGO data.
We present a search for gravitational waves from black hole ringdowns in
the fourth LIGO science run S4, during which LIGO was sensitive to the
dominant mode of perturbed black holes with masses in the range of
10M_{ȯ} to 500M_{ȯ}, the regime of
intermediate-mass black holes, to distances up to 300 Mpc. We present a
search for gravitational waves from black hole ringdowns using data from
S4. No gravitational wave candidates were found; we place a
90\%-confidence upper limit on the rate of ringdowns from black holes
with mass between 85M_{ȯ} and 390M_{ȯ} in the
local universe, assuming a uniform distribution of sources, of
3.2{\times}10^{-5}yr^{-1}Mpc^{-3}=1.6{\times}10^{-3}yr^{-1}L_{10}^{-1},where
L_{10} is 10^{10} times the solar blue-light luminosity.

SDSSJ092712.65+294344.0 is hosting a massive black hole binary embedded
in a circumbinary disc. The lightest, secondary black hole is active,
and gas orbiting around it is responsible for the blue-shifted broad
emission lines with velocity off-set of 2650 km s^{-1}, relative
to the galaxy rest frame. As the tidal interaction of the binary with
the outer disc is expected to excavate a gap, the blue-shifted narrow
emission lines are consistent with being emitted from the low-density
inhomogeneous gas of the hollow region. From the observations, we infer
a binary mass ratio q \~{} 0.3, a mass for the primary of M_{1} \~{} 2
{\times} 10^{9}M_{solar}, and a semimajor axis of 0.34
pc, corresponding to an orbital period of 370 years. We use the results
of cosmological merger trees to estimate the likelihood of observing
SDSSJ092712.65+294344.0 as recoiling black hole or as a binary. We find
that the binary hypothesis is preferred being 100 times more probable
than the ejection hypothesis. If SDSSJ092712.65+294344.0 hosts a binary,
it would be the one closest massive black hole binary system ever

substantially modified version of the one introduced by Springel, Di
Matteo {\amp} Hernquist implemented in a significantly expanded version
of the GADGET III code, which contains new prescriptions for star
formation, supernova feedback, radiative cooling and chemodynamics. We
simulate the growth of BHs from an initial seed state via
Eddington-limited accretion of the surrounding gas, and via mergers with
other BHs. Because cosmological simulations at present lack both the
resolution and the physics to model the multiphase interstellar medium,
they tend to strongly underestimate the Bondi-Hoyle accretion rate. To
allow low-mass BHs to grow, it is therefore necessary to increase the
predicted Bondi-Hoyle rates in star-forming gas by large factors, either
by explicitly multiplying the accretion rate by a numerical correction
factor or by using an unresolved, subgrid model for the gas close to the
BH. We explore the physical regimes where the use of such multiplicative
factors is reasonable, and through this introduce a new prescription for
gas accretion by BHs. Feedback from AGN is modelled by coupling a
fraction of the rest-mass energy of the accreted gas thermally into the
surrounding medium. We describe the implementation as well as the
limitations of the model in detail and motivate all the changes relative
to previous work. We demonstrate how general physical considerations can
be used to choose many of the parameters of the model and demonstrate
that the fiducial model reproduces observational constraints.

We employ a large suite of cosmological simulations, in which the
parameters of the BH model are varied away from their fiducial values,
to investigate the robustness of the predictions for the cosmic star
formation history and the redshift zero cosmic BH density, BH scaling
relations and galaxy-specific star formation rates. We find that the
freedom introduced by the need to increase the predicted accretion rates
by hand, the standard procedure in the literature, is the most
significant source of uncertainty. Our simulations demonstrate that
supermassive BHs are able to regulate their growth by releasing a fixed
amount of energy for a given halo mass, independent of the assumed
efficiency of AGN feedback, which sets the normalization of the BH
scaling relations. Regardless of whether BH seeds are initially placed
above or below the BH scaling relations, they grow on to the same
scaling relations. AGN feedback efficiently suppresses star formation in
high-mass galaxies.

accurately describe the early inspiral phase, we find that its fast
increase during the late inspiral and plunge, and the arbitrariness in
determining until when it should be trusted, makes the PN predictions
for the total recoil not very accurate and robust. Nevertheless, the
linear-momentum flux at higher PN orders can be employed to build more
reliable resummed expressions aimed at capturing the nonperturbative

the smallest orbital velocity in the disk (a likely scenario in real
active galactic nuclei), we observe a common, characteristic pattern in
the internal energy of the disk. Variations in kick velocity simply
provide a phase offset in the characteristic pattern implying that

do massive black holes pair in a merger? Depending on the properties of
the underlying galaxies, do black holes always form a close Keplerian
binary? If a binary forms, does hardening proceed down to the domain
controlled by gravitational wave back reaction? What is the role played
by gas and/or stars in braking the black holes, and on which timescale
does coalescence occur? Can the black holes accrete on flight and shine
during their pathway to coalescence? N-Body/hydrodynamical codes have
proven to be vital tools for studying their evolution, and progress in
this field is expected to grow rapidly in the effort to describe, in

mergers spectroscopically rather than through host galaxy imaging. Our
technique exploits the dynamics of supermassive black holes (SMBHs)
powering active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in merger-remnant galaxies.
Because structure in the universe is built up through galaxy mergers and
nearly all galaxies host a central SMBH, some galaxies should possess
two SMBHs near their centers as the result of a recent merger. These
SMBHs spiral to the center of the resultant merger-remnant galaxy, and
one or both of the SMBHs may power AGNs. Using the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift
Survey, we have examined 1881 red galaxies, of which 91 exhibit [O III]
and H{$\beta$} emission lines indicative of Seyfert 2 activity. Of these,
32 AGNs have [O III] emission-line redshifts significantly different
from the redshifts of the host galaxies' stars, corresponding to
velocity offsets of \~{}50 km s^{-1} to \~{}300 km
s^{-1}. Two of these AGNs exhibit double-peaked [O III]
emission lines, while the remaining 30 AGNs each exhibit a single set of
velocity-offset [O III] emission lines. After exploring a variety of
physical models for these velocity offsets, we argue that the most
likely explanation is inspiralling SMBHs in merger-remnant galaxies.
Based on this interpretation, we find that roughly half of the red
galaxies hosting AGNs are also merger remnants, which implies that
mergers may trigger AGN activity in red galaxies. The AGN velocity
offsets we find imply a merger fraction of \~{}30\% and a merger rate of \~{}3
mergers Gyr^{-1} for red galaxies at redshifts 0.34 {\lt} z

cluster is combined with published data to derive composite profiles of
brightness, ellipticity, position angle, isophote shape, and color over
large radius ranges. These provide enough leverage to show that
S{\'e}rsic log I vprop r ^{1/n } functions fit the brightness
profiles I(r) of nearly all ellipticals remarkably well over large
dynamic ranges. Therefore, we can confidently identify departures from
these profiles that are diagnostic of galaxy formation. Two kinds of
departures are seen at small radii. All 10 of our ellipticals with total
absolute magnitudes M_{VT} {\lt}= -21.66 have cuspy
cores{\mdash}''missing light''{\mdash}at small radii. Cores are well known
and naturally scoured by binary black holes (BHs) formed in
dissipationless (''dry'') mergers. All 17 ellipticals with -21.54
{\lt}= M_{VT} {\lt}= -15.53 do not have cores. We find a new
distinct component in these galaxies: all coreless ellipticals in our
sample have extra light at the center above the inward extrapolation of
the outer S{\'e}rsic profile. In large ellipticals, the excess light
is spatially resolved and resembles the central components predicted in
numerical simulations of mergers of galaxies that contain gas. In the
simulations, the gas dissipates, falls toward the center, undergoes a
starburst, and builds a compact stellar component that, as in our
observations, is distinct from the S{\'e}rsic-function main body of
the elliptical. But ellipticals with extra light also contain
supermassive BHs. We suggest that the starburst has swamped core
scouring by binary BHs. That is, we interpret extra light components as
a signature of formation in dissipative (''wet'') mergers.

Besides extra light, we find three new aspects to the (''E-E'') dichotomy
into two types of elliptical galaxies. Core galaxies are known to be
slowly rotating, to have relatively anisotropic velocity distributions,
and to have boxy isophotes. We show that they have S{\'e}rsic indices
n {\gt} 4 uncorrelated with M_{VT} . They also are
{$\alpha$}-element enhanced, implying short star-formation timescales. And
their stellar populations have a variety of ages but mostly are very
old. Extra light ellipticals generally rotate rapidly, are more
isotropic than core Es, and have disky isophotes. We show that they have
n sime 3 {\plusmn} 1 almost uncorrelated with M_{VT} and younger
and less {$\alpha$}-enhanced stellar populations. These are new clues to
galaxy formation. We suggest that extra light ellipticals got their low
S{\'e}rsic indices by forming in relatively few binary mergers,
whereas giant ellipticals have n {\gt} 4 because they formed in larger
numbers of mergers of more galaxies at once plus later heating during
hierarchical clustering.

We confirm that core Es contain X-ray-emitting gas whereas extra light
Es generally do not. This leads us to suggest why the E-E dichotomy
arose. If energy feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) requires a
''working surface'' of hot gas, then this is present in core galaxies but
absent in extra light galaxies. We suggest that AGN energy feedback is a
strong function of galaxy mass: it is weak enough in small Es not to
prevent merger starbursts but strong enough in giant Es and their
progenitors to make dry mergers dry and to protect old stellar
populations from late star formation.

Finally, we verify that there is a strong dichotomy between elliptical
and spheroidal galaxies. Their properties are consistent with our
understanding of their different formation processes: mergers for
ellipticals and conversion of late-type galaxies into spheroidals by
environmental effects and by energy feedback from supernovae.

In an appendix, we develop machinery to get realistic error estimates
for S{\'e}rsic parameters even when they are strongly coupled. And we
discuss photometric dynamic ranges necessary to get robust results from
S{\'e}rsic fits.

{\ap} 6 quasars observed in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) are
thought to have assembled by mergers and/or gas accretion from less
massive ''seed'' BHs. If the seeds are the \~{}10^{2} M
_{sun} remnant BHs from the first generation of stars, they must
be in place well before redshift z = 6, and must avoid being ejected
from their parent protogalaxies by the large (several
{\times}10^{2} km s^{-1}) kicks they suffer from
gravitational-radiation-induced recoil during mergers with other BHs. We
simulate the SMBH mass function at redshift z {\gt} 6 using dark matter
halo merger trees, coupled with a prescription for the halo occupation
fraction, accretion histories, and radial recoil trajectories of the
growing BHs. Our purpose is (1) to map out plausible scenarios for
successful assembly of the z {\ap} 6 quasar BHs by exploring a wide
region of parameter space, and (2) to predict the rate of low-frequency
gravitational wave events detectable by the Laser Interferometer Space
Antenna (LISA) for each such scenario. Our main findings are as follows:
(1) \~{}100 M _{sun} seed BHs can grow into the SDSS quasar BHs
without super-Eddington accretion, but only if they form in minihalos at
z gsim 30 and subsequently accrete gsim60\% of the time; (2) the
scenarios with optimistic assumptions required to explain the SDSS
quasar BHs overproduce the mass density in lower mass (few
{\times}10^{5} M _{sun} lsim M _{bh}lsim few
{\times} 10^{7} M _{sun}) BHs by a factor of
10^{2}-10^{3}, unless seeds stop forming, or accrete at
a severely diminished rates or duty cycles (e.g., due to feedback), at z
lsim 20-30. We also present several successful assembly models and their
LISA detection rates, including a ''maximal'' model that gives the highest
rate (\~{}30 yr^{-1} at z = 6) without overproducing the
total SMBH density.

S_{1}/m_{1}^{2}{\tilde}0.6 and
S_{2}/m_{2}^{2}{\tilde}0.4 and orbits 9 times
prior to merger. The numerical simulation starts with an initial
separation of r{\ap}11M and orbital parameters determined by 2.5 PN and
3.5 PN evolutions of a quasi-circular binary starting from r=50M. The
resulting binaries have very little eccentricity according to the 2.5 PN
and 3.5 PN systems, but show eccentricities of  etilde 0.01-0.02
and  etilde 0.002-0.005 in the respective numerical simulations,
thus demonstrating that 3.5 PN significantly reduces the eccentricity of
the binary compared to 2.5 PN. We perform three numerical evolutions
from r{\ap}11M with maximum resolutions of h=M/48, M/53.3, M/59.3, to
verify numerical convergence. We observe a reasonably good agreement
between the PN and numerical waveforms, with an overlap of nearly 99\%
for the first six cycles of the ({\ell}=2, m={\plusmn}2) modes, 91\% for
the ({\ell}=2, m={\plusmn}1) modes, and nearly 91\% for the ({\ell}=3,
m={\plusmn}3) modes. The phase differences between numerical and
post-Newtonian approximations appear to be independent of the ({\ell},m)
modes considered and relatively small for the first 3-4 orbits. An
advantage of the 3.5 PN model over the 2.5 PN one seems to be observed,
which indicates that still higher PN order (perhaps even 4.0 PN) may
yield significantly better waveforms. In addition, we identify features
in the waveforms likely related to precession and precession-induced
eccentricity.

mergers driven by angular momentum loss to small-scale gas discs. Such
binaries form after major galaxy mergers, but their fate is unclear
since hardening through stellar scattering becomes very inefficient at
subparsec distances. Gas discs may dominate binary dynamics on these
scales, and promote mergers. Using numerical simulations, we investigate
the evolution of the semimajor axis and eccentricity of binaries
embedded within geometrically thin gas discs. Our simulations directly
resolve angular momentum transport within the disc, which at the radii
of interest is likely dominated by disc self-gravity. We show that the
binary decays at a rate which is in good agreement with analytical
estimates, while the eccentricity grows. Saturation of eccentricity
growth is not observed up to values e {\gt}\~{} 0.35. Accretion on to the
black holes is variable, and is roughly modulated by the binary orbital
frequency. Scaling our results, we analytically estimate the maximum
rate of binary decay that is possible without fragmentation occurring
within the surrounding gas disc, and compare that rate to an estimate of
the stellar dynamical hardening rate. For binary masses in the range
10^{5} {\lt}\~{} M {\lt}\~{} 10^{8}M_{solar} we find
that decay due to gas discs may dominate for separations below a \~{}
0.01-0.1pc, in the regime where the disc is optically thick. The minimum
merger time-scale is shorter than the Hubble time for M {\lt}\~{}
10^{7}M_{solar}. This implies that gas discs could
commonly attend relatively low-mass black hole mergers, and that a
significant population of binaries might exist at separations of a few
hundredths of a parsec, where the combined decay rate is slowest. For
more massive binaries, where this mechanism fails to act quickly enough,
we suggest that scattering of stars formed within a fragmenting gas disc
could act as a significant additional sink of binary angular momentum.

inspiral and merger of black hole (BH)-neutron star (NS) binaries are

initial conditions, BH-NS binaries in a quasiequilibrium state are
prepared in a modified version of the moving-puncture approach. The BH
is modeled by a nonspinning moving puncture and, for the NS, a
polytropic equation of state with {$\Gamma$}=2 and the irrotational
velocity field are employed. The mass ratio of the BH to the NS,
Q=M_{BH}/M_{NS}, is chosen in the range between 1.5 and
5. The compactness of the NS, defined by
C=GM_{NS}/c^{2}R_{NS}, is chosen to be between
0.145 and 0.178. For a large value of Q for which the NS is not tidally
disrupted and is simply swallowed by the BH, gravitational waves are
characterized by inspiral, merger and ringdown waveforms. In this case,
the waveforms are qualitatively the same as that from BH-BH binaries.
For a sufficiently small value of Q{\lsim}2, the NS may be tidally
disrupted before it is swallowed by the BH. In this case, the amplitude
of the merger and ringdown waveforms is very low, and thus,
gravitational waves are characterized by the inspiral waveform and
subsequent quick damping. The difference in the merger and ringdown
waveforms is clearly reflected in the spectrum shape and in the
{\ldquo}cutoff{\rdquo} frequency above which the spectrum amplitude
steeply decreases. When a NS is not tidally disrupted (e.g., for Q=5),
kick velocity, induced by asymmetric gravitational-wave emission, agrees
approximately with that derived for the merger of BH-BH binaries,
whereas for the case when the tidal disruption occurs, the kick velocity
is significantly suppressed.

sets are nearly identical, except the BH spin is varied between
a/M_{BH}=-0.5 (antialigned), 0.0, and 0.75. The number of orbits
before merger increases with a/M_{BH}, as expected. We also
study the nonspinning BH case in more detail, varying q between 1, 3,

follow the dynamics of gas, stars, and dark matter, and include
radiative cooling, star formation and black hole (BH) accretion, and the
associated feedback processes as in Springel et al. We study the mass
assembly of the BHs and discuss technical issues of the implemented
model in detail. For Sp-Sp mergers, the peak star formation rate and BH
accretion rate decrease and the growth timescales of the central BHs and
newly formed stars increase with higher progenitor mass ratios. The peak
BH accretion rate typically occurs shortly after the time of BH merging
for low progenitor mass ratios (e.g., 3:1 and lower), whereas for higher
progenitor mass ratios there is no clear correlation between the peak BH
accretion rate and the BH merging time. The termination of star
formation by BH feedback in disk mergers is significantly less important
for higher progenitor mass ratios (e.g., 3:1 and higher). In addition,
the inclusion of BH feedback efficiently suppresses star formation in
dry E-E mergers and mixed E-Sp mergers. All merger remnants, independent
of their progenitors, follow the observed relations between the central
BH mass and the stellar velocity dispersion (M _{BH} -
{$\sigma$}), the bulge mass (M _{BH} - M _{*}), and
the bulge binding energy (M _{BH} - M

arising from variations in the initial gas mass fraction. The
normalizations for all relations and the simulated slope of the M

observations, whereas the simulated slope of the M _{BH} -
M _{*} relation is slightly steeper compared to the

self-regulates the mass growth of the BHs in accordance with the
observed relations for a very wide range of merger progenitors.

measurements to estimate the bolometric AGN luminosity function and
compare to X-ray background data and the independent estimate of Hopkins
et al. to assess remaining systematic uncertainties. The integrated AGN
emissivity closely tracks the cosmic star-formation history, suggesting
that star formation and black hole growth are closely linked at all
redshifts. We discuss observational uncertainties in the local black
hole mass function, which remain substantial, with estimates of the
integrated black hole mass density {$\rho$}_{•} spanning the
range 3-5.5 {\times} 10^{5} M _{sun}
Mpc^{-3}. We find good agreement with estimates of the
local mass function for a reference model where all active black holes
have a fixed efficiency epsilon = 0.065 and L _{bol}/L
_{Edd} {\ap} 0.4 (shifting to epsilon = 0.09, L _{bol}/L
_{Edd} {\ap} 0.9 for the Hopkins et al. luminosity function). In
our reference model, the duty cycle of 10^{9} M _{sun}
black holes declines from 0.07 at z = 3 to 0.004 at z = 1 and
10^{-4} at z = 0. The decline is shallower for less
massive black holes, a signature of ''downsizing'' evolution in which more
massive black holes build their mass earlier. The predicted duty cycles
and AGN clustering bias in this model are in reasonable accord with
observational estimates. If the typical Eddington ratio declines at z
{\lt} 2, then the ''downsizing'' of black hole growth is less pronounced.
Models with reduced Eddington ratios at low redshift or black hole mass
predict fewer low-mass black holes (M _{•} lsim
10^{8} M _{sun}) in the local universe, while models
with black hole mergers predict more black holes at M _{•}

emissivity to the local black hole mass density implies epsilon = 0.075
{\times} ({$\rho$}_{•}/4.5 {\times} 10^{5} M

standard luminosity function estimate, or 25\% higher for Hopkins et

model in which most black holes have the high efficiencies epsilon {\ap}
0.16-0.20 predicted by MHD simulations of disk accretion. We provide
electronic tabulations of our bolometric luminosity function and our
reference model predictions for black hole mass functions and duty

simulation of an equal-mass, nonspinning black-hole binary. We also
estimate the (derivative of the) center-of-mass energy from the
simulation by assuming energy balance. We compare these quantities with
the predictions of various PN approximants [adiabatic Taylor and
Pad{\'e} models; nonadiabatic effective-one-body (EOB) models]. We
find that Pad{\'e} summation of the energy flux does not accelerate
the convergence of the flux series; nevertheless, the Pad{\'e} flux
is markedly closer to the numerical result for the whole range of the
simulation (about 30 GW cycles). Taylor and Pad{\'e} models
overestimate the increase in flux and frequency derivative close to
merger, whereas EOB models reproduce more faithfully the shape of and
are closer to the numerical flux, frequency derivative, and derivative
of energy. We also compare the GW phase of the numerical simulation with
Pad{\'e} and EOB models. Matching numerical and untuned 3.5 PN order
waveforms, we find that the phase difference accumulated until
M{$\omega$}=0.1 is -0.12 radians for Pad{\'e} approximants, and 0.50
(0.45) radians for an EOB approximant with Keplerian (non-Keplerian)
flux. We fit free parameters within the EOB models to minimize the phase
difference, and confirm the presence of degeneracies among these
parameters. By tuning the pseudo 4PN order coefficients in the radial
potential or in the flux, or, if present, the location of the pole in
the flux, we find that the accumulated phase difference at M{$\omega$}=0.1
can be reduced{\mdash}if desired{\mdash}to much less than the estimated
numerical phase error (0.02 radians).

gravitational wave (GW) emission can cause black holes to recoil at
speeds up to thousands of km s^{-1}. These GW recoil events can
dramatically affect the co-evolution of recoiling supermassive black
holes (SMBHs) and their host galaxies. However, theoretical studies of
SMBH-galaxy evolution almost always assume a stationary central black
hole. In light of the numerical results on GW recoil velocities, we
relax that assumption here and consider the consequences of recoil for
SMBH evolution. We follow the trajectories of SMBHs ejected in a smooth
background potential that includes both a stellar bulge and a
multicomponent gaseous disc. In addition, we calculate the accretion
rate on to the SMBH as a function of time, using a hybrid prescription
of viscous ({$\alpha$}-disc) and Bondi accretion. We find that recoil kicks
between 100km s^{-1} and the escape speed cause SMBHs to wander
through the galaxy and halo for \~{}10^{6}-10^{9}yr before
settling back to the galactic centre. However, the mass accreted during
this time is roughly constant at \~{}10per cent of the initial mass,
independent of the recoil velocity. This indicates that while large
recoils may disrupt active galactic nuclei feedback processes, recoil
itself is an effective means of regulating SMBH growth. Recoiling SMBHs
may be observable as spatially or kinematically offset quasars, but
finding such systems could be challenging, because the largest offsets
correspond to the shortest quasar lifetimes.

represent the state of the art from several points of view: (i) We use
high-resolution shock-capturing methods for the solution of the

for the solution of the Einstein equations; (ii) We employ adaptive
mesh-refinement techniques with {\ldquo}moving boxes{\rdquo} that provide

accurate solutions of the Einstein equations for a system of binary
neutron stars in irrotational quasicircular orbits; (iv) We exploit the
isolated-horizon formalism to measure the properties of the black holes
produced in the merger; (v) Finally, we use two approaches, based either
on gauge-invariant perturbations or on Weyl scalars, to calculate the
gravitational waves emitted by the system. Within our idealized
treatment of the matter, these techniques allow us to perform accurate
evolutions on time scales never reported before (i.e. {\tilde}30ms) and
to provide the first complete description of the inspiral and merger of
a neutron-star binary leading to the prompt or delayed formation of a
black hole and to its ringdown. We consider either a polytropic equation
of state or that of an ideal fluid and show that already with this
idealized treatment a very interesting phenomenology can be described.
In particular, we show that while higher-mass polytropic binaries lead
to the prompt formation of a rapidly rotating black hole surrounded by a
dense torus, lower-mass binaries give rise to a differentially rotating
star, which undergoes large oscillations and emits large amounts of
gravitational radiation. Eventually, also the hyper-massive neutron star
collapses to a rotating black hole surrounded by a torus. Finally, we
also show that the use of a nonisentropic equation of state leads to
significantly different evolutions, giving rise to a delayed collapse
also with high-mass binaries, as well as to a more intense emission of
gravitational waves and to a geometrically thicker torus.

SMBHs in all three scenarios follow the same black hole fundamental
plane (BHFP) and correlation with bulge binding energy seen in
simulations of major mergers, and observed locally. Furthermore,
provided that the total gas supply is significantly larger than the mass
of the SMBH, its limiting mass is not influenced by the amount of gas
available or the efficiency of black hole growth. This supports the
assertion that SMBHs accrete until they reach a critical mass at which
feedback is sufficient to unbind the gas locally, terminating the inflow
and stalling further growth. At the same time, while minor and major
mergers follow the same projected correlations (e.g., the
M_{BH}-{$\sigma$} and Magorrian relations), SMBHs grown via disk
instabilities do not, owing to structural differences between the host
bulges. This finding is supported by recent observations of SMBHs in
pseudobulges and bulges in barred systems, as compared to those hosted
by classical bulges. Taken together, this provides support for the BHFP
and binding energy correlations as being more ``fundamental'' than other
proposed correlations in that they reflect the physical mechanism
driving the coevolution of SMBHs and spheroids.

radiation can produce three different types of spin measurements,
yielding, respectively, the spins of the two black holes in a binary
inspiral prior to merger, the spin of the merger remnant (as encoded in
the ring-down waves), and the spin of ``single'' black holes during the
extreme mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI) of compact objects. The latter spin
population is also accessible to iron-line measurements. We compute and

in terms of the implicit rotating source, among the evolution of
frequency and amplitude, which hold for the late-time radiation. These
detailed relationships provide sufficient information about the

 abstract = "{We present a comprehensive synthesis model for the active galactic
nuclei (AGN) evolution and the growth of supermassive black hole (SMBH)
in the Universe. We assume that black holes accrete in just three
distinct physical states, or `modes': at low Eddington ratio, only a
radiatively inefficient, kinetically dominated mode is allowed [low
kinetic (LK)] at high Eddington ratio, instead, AGN may display both a
purely radiative [radio quiet, high radiative (HR)] and a kinetic [radio
loud, high kinetic (HK)] mode. We solve the continuity equation for the
black hole mass function using the locally determined one as a boundary
condition, and the hard X-ray luminosity function as tracer of the AGN
growth rate distribution, supplemented with a luminosity-dependent
bolometric correction and an absorbing column distribution. Differently
from most previous semi-analytic and numerical models for black hole
growth, we do not assume any specific distribution of Eddington ratios,
rather we determine it empirically by coupling the mass and luminosity
functions and a set of fundamental relations between observables in the
three accretion modes. SMBH always show a very broad accretion rate
distribution, and we discuss the profound consequences of this fact for
our understanding of observed AGN fractions in galaxies, as well as for
the empirical determination of SMBH mass functions with large surveys.
We confirm previous results and clearly demonstrate that, at least for z
{\lt}\~{} 1.5, SMBH mass function evolves antihierarchically, i.e. the most
massive holes grew earlier and faster than less massive ones. For the
first time, we find hints of a reversal of such a downsizing behaviour
at redshifts above the peak of the black hole accretion rate density (z
\~{} 2). We also derive tight constraints on the (mass-weighted) average
radiative efficiency of AGN: under the simplifying assumption that the
mass density of both high redshift (z \~{} 5) and `wandering' black holes
ejected from galactic nuclei after merger events are negligible compared
to the local mass density, we find that 0.065 {\lt}
{$\xi$}_{0}{\lt}{$\epsilon$}_{rad}{\gt} {\lt} 0.07, where
{$\xi$}_{0} is the local SMBH mass density in units of 4.3 {\times}
10^{5}M_{solar}Mpc^{-3}. We trace the
cosmological evolution of the kinetic luminosity function of AGN, and
find that the overall efficiency of SMBH in converting accreted rest
mass energy into kinetic power, {$\epsilon$}_{kin}, ranges between
{$\epsilon$}_{kin} \~{}= (3-5) {\times} 10^{-3}, depending on
the choice of the radio core luminosity function. Such a `kinetic
efficiency' varies however strongly with SMBH mass and redshift, being
maximal for very massive holes at late times, as required for the AGN
feedback by many galaxy formation models in cosmological contexts.

nearly the largest possible for Bowen-York black holes, in a set of
configurations with the spins counteraligned and pointing in the orbital
plane, which maximizes the recoil velocities of the merger remnant, as
well as a configuration where the two spins point in the same direction
as the orbital angular momentum, which maximizes the orbital hangup
effect and remnant spin. The coordinate radii of the individual apparent
horizons in these cases are very small and the simulations require very
high central resolutions ( htilde M/320). We find that these highly
spinning holes reach a maximum recoil velocity of
{\tilde}3300kms^{-1} (the largest simulated so far) and, for the
hangup configuration, a remnant spin of a/m_{H}{\tilde}0.922.
These results are consistent with our previous predictions for the
maximum recoil velocity of {\tilde}4000kms^{-1} and remnant spin;
the latter reinforcing the prediction that cosmic censorship is not
violated by merging highly spinning black-hole binaries. We also
numerically solve the initial data for, and evolve, a single
maximal-Bowen-York-spin black hole, and confirm that the 3-metric has an
O(r^{-2}) singularity at the puncture, rather than the usual
O(r^{-4}) singularity seen for nonmaximal spins.

we introduced a spin expansion that provides a simple yet powerful way
to understand aspects of binary black hole merger. This approach relies
on the symmetry properties of initial and final quantities like the
black hole mass m, kick velocity k, and spin vector s, rather than a
detailed understanding of the merger dynamics. In this paper, we expand
on this proposal, examine how well its predictions agree with current
simulations, and discuss several future directions that would make it an
even more valuable tool. The spin expansion yields many new predictions,
including several exact results that may be useful for testing numerical
codes. Some of these predictions have already been confirmed, while
others await future simulations. We explain how a relatively small
number of simulations{\mdash}10 equal-mass simulations, and 16
unequal-mass simulations{\mdash}may be used to calibrate all of the
coefficients in the spin expansion up to second order at the minimum
computational cost. For a more general set of simulations of given
covariance, we derive the minimum-variance unbiased estimators for the
spin-expansion coefficients. We discuss how this calibration would be
interesting and fruitful for general relativity and astrophysics.
Finally, we sketch the extension to eccentric orbits.

angular dependence of the signal-to-noise ratio and the mismatch of the

growth histories of SMBHs depend on their host type. The discrepancy
between the slope of the M_{bh}-{$\sigma$}_{*} relations
using different definition of velocity dispersion vanishes in our

SMBHs and their host galaxies more effectively. We also find the slope
for the `core' elliptical galaxies at the high-mass range of the

binary black-hole coalescences can be modeled accurately by

progress in numerical relativity has enabled us to model also the
nonperturbative merger phase of the binary black-hole coalescence
problem. This enables us to coherently search for all three stages of
the coalescence of nonspinning binary black holes using a single
template bank. Taking our motivation from these results, we propose a
family of template waveforms which can model the inspiral, merger, and
ring-down stages of the coalescence of nonspinning binary black holes
that follow quasicircular inspiral. This two-dimensional template family
is explicitly parametrized by the physical parameters of the binary. We
show that the template family is not only effectual in detecting the
signals from black-hole coalescences, but also faithful in estimating
the parameters of the binary. We compare the sensitivity of a search (in
the context of different ground-based interferometers) using all three
stages of the black-hole coalescence with other template-based searches
which look for individual stages separately. We find that the proposed
search is significantly more sensitive than other template-based
searches for a substantial mass range, potentially bringing about
remarkable improvement in the event rate of ground-based
interferometers. As part of this work, we also prescribe a general
procedure to construct interpolated template banks using nonspinning
black-hole waveforms produced by numerical relativity.

cores by such kicks and the effects on the stellar distribution using
high-accuracy direct N-body simulations. Following the kick, the motion
of the SMBH exhibits three distinct phases. (1) The SMBH oscillates with
decreasing amplitude, losing energy via dynamical friction at each core
passage. Chandrasekhar's theory accurately reproduces the motion of the
SMBH if 2{\lt}\~{}ln{$\Lambda$}{\lt}\~{}3 and if the changing core density is taken
into account. (2) When the amplitude of the motion has fallen to roughly
the core radius, the SMBH and core begin to exhibit oscillations about
their common center of mass. These oscillations decay with a time
constant that is at least 10 times longer than predicted by
Chandrasekhar's formula. (3) Eventually, the SMBH reaches thermal
equilibrium with the stars. The time for the SMBH's oscillations to damp
to the Brownian level is as long as \~{}1 Gyr in the brightest galaxies.
The longevity of the oscillations makes this mechanism competitive with
others proposed to explain double or offset nuclei. Ejection of SMBHs
also results in a lowered density of stars near the galaxy center; mass
deficits as large as five times the SMBH mass can be produced. We
compare the N-body density profiles with luminosity profiles of
early-type galaxies in Virgo and show that even the largest observed
cores can be reproduced by the kicks. Implications for displaced AGNs

mass ratios of 2{\ratio}1 and 1{\ratio}1, even when we reduce the neutron
stars (NS) compaction in the 2{\ratio}1 mass ratio case. These ambient
disks reach temperatures suitable for triggering SGRBs, but their masses
may be too small to produce the required total energy output. We measure
gravitational waveforms and compute the effective strain in frequency
space, finding measurable differences between our waveforms and those
produced by binary black hole mergers within the advanced LIGO band.
These differences appear at frequencies corresponding to the emission
that occurs when the NS is tidally disrupted and accreted by the black
hole. The resulting information about the radius of the neutron star may
be used to constrain the neutron star equation of state.

of only \~{}10^{-3} of the stellar bulge mass. Thus, whatever
process grows the black hole also promotes star formation with far
higher efficiency. We interpret this in terms of the generic tendency of
active galactic nucleus (AGN) accretion discs to become self-gravitating
outside some small radius R_{sg} \~{} 0.01-0.1 pc from the black
hole. We argue that mergers consist of sequences of such episodes, each
limited by self-gravity to a mass {$\Delta$}M_{episode} \~{}
10^{-3} M, with angular momentum characteristic of the small
part of the accretion flow which formed it. In this picture, a major
merger with {$\Delta$}M_{merger} \~{} M gives rise to a long series of
low-mass accretion disc episodes, all chaotically oriented with respect
to one another. Thus, the angular momentum vector oscillates randomly
during the accretion process, on mass-scales \~{} 10^{3} times
smaller than the total mass accreted in a major merger event.

We show that for essentially all AGN parameters, the disc produced by
any accretion episode of this type has lower angular momentum than the
hole, allowing stable co- and counter-alignment of the discs through the
Lense-Thirring effect. A sequence of randomly oriented accretion
episodes as envisaged above then produces accretion discs stably co- or
counter-aligned with the black hole spin with almost equal frequency.
Accretion from these discs very rapidly adjusts the hole's spin
parameter to average values (the precise range depending slightly on the
disc vertical viscosity coefficient {$\alpha$}_{2}) from any
initial conditions, but with significant fluctuations ({$\Delta$}a \~{}
+/-0.2) about these. We conclude that (i) supermassive black holes
(SMBH) should on average spin moderately, with the mean value decreasing
slowly as the mass increases; (ii) SMBH coalescences leave little
long-term effect on ; (iii) SMBH coalescence products in general have
modest recoil velocities, so that there is little likelihood of their
being ejected from the host galaxy; (iv) black holes can grow even from
stellar masses to \~{}5 {\times} 10^{9}M_{solar} at high
redshift z \~{} 6; and (v) jets produced in successive accretion episodes
can have similar directions, but after several episodes the jet
direction deviates significantly. Rare examples of massive holes with
larger spin parameters could result from prograde coalescences with
SMBHs of similar mass, and are most likely to be found in giant
ellipticals. We compare these results with observation.

Ansatz that star formation is quenched after a gas-rich,
spheroid-forming major merger, we demonstrate that this naturally
predicts the turnover in the efficiency of star formation and baryon
fractions in galaxies at \~{}L_{*} (without any parameters tuned to
this value), as well as the observed mass functions and mass density of
red galaxies as a function of redshift, the formation times of
early-type galaxies as a function of mass, and the fraction of quenched
galaxies as a function of galaxy and halo mass, environment, and
redshift. Comparing our model to a variety of semianalytic models in
which quenching is primarily driven by halo mass considerations or
secular/disk instabilities, we demonstrate that our model makes unique
and robust qualitative predictions for a number of observables,
including the bivariate red fraction as a function of galaxy and halo
mass, the density of passive galaxies at high redshifts, the
emergence/evolution of the color-morphology-density relations at high
redshift, and the fraction of disky/boxy (or cusp/core) spheroids as a
function of mass. In each case, the observations favor a model in which
some mechanism quenches future star formation after a major merger
builds a massive spheroid. Models where quenching is dominated by a halo
mass threshold fail to match the behavior of the bivariate red
fractions, predict too low a density of passive galaxies at high
redshift, and overpredict by an order of magnitude the mass of the
transition from disky to boxy ellipticals. Models driven by secular disk
instabilities also qualitatively disagree with the bivariate red
fractions, fail to predict the observed evolution in the color-density
relations, and predict order-of-magnitude incorrect distributions of
kinematic types in early-type galaxies. We make specific predictions for
how future observations, for example, quantifying the red fraction as a
function of galaxy mass, halo mass, environment, or redshift, can break
the degeneracies between a number of different assumptions adopted in
present galaxy formation models. We discuss a variety of physical
possibilities for this quenching and propose a mixed scenario in which
traditional quenching in hot, quasi-static massive halos is supplemented
by the strong shocks and feedback energy input associated with a major
merger (e.g., tidal shocks, starburst-driven winds, and quasar
feedback), which temporarily suppress cooling and establish the
conditions of a dynamically hot halo in the central regions of the host,
even in low-mass halos (below the traditional threshold for accretion
shocks).

of starbursts, quasars, and spheroidal galaxies. By combining
theoretically well-constrained halo and subhalo mass functions as a
function of redshift and environment with empirical halo occupation
models, we can estimate where galaxies of given properties live at a
particular epoch. This allows us to calculate, in an a priori
cosmological manner, where major galaxy-galaxy mergers occur and what
kinds of galaxies merge, at all redshifts. We compare this with the
observed mass functions, clustering, fractions as a function of halo and
galaxy mass, and small-scale environments of mergers, and we show that
this approach yields robust estimates in good agreement with
observations and can be extended to predict detailed properties of
mergers. Making the simple Ansatz that major, gas-rich mergers cause
quasar activity (but not strictly assuming they are the only triggering
mechanism), we demonstrate that this model naturally reproduces the
observed rise and fall of the quasar luminosity density at z=0-6, as
well as quasar luminosity functions, fractions, host galaxy colors, and
clustering as a function of redshift and luminosity. The recent observed
excess of quasar clustering on small scales at z\~{}0.2-2.5 is a natural
prediction of our model, as mergers will preferentially occur in regions
with excess small-scale galaxy overdensities. In fact, we demonstrate
that quasar environments at all observed redshifts correspond closely to
the empirically determined small group scale, where major mergers of
\~{}L_{*} gas-rich galaxies will be most efficient. We contrast
this with a secular model in which quasar activity is driven by bars or
other disk instabilities, and we show that, while these modes of fueling
probably dominate the high Eddington ratio population at Seyfert
luminosities (significant at z=0), the constraints from quasar
clustering, observed pseudobulge populations, and disk mass functions
suggest that they are a small contributor to the z{\gt}\~{}1 quasar
luminosity density, which is dominated by massive BHs in predominantly
classical spheroids formed in mergers. Similarly, low-luminosity
Seyferts do not show a clustering excess on small scales, in agreement
with the natural prediction of secular models, but bright quasars at all
redshifts do so. We also compare recent observations of the colors of
quasar host galaxies and show that these correspond to the colors of
recent merger remnants, in the transition region between the blue cloud
and the red sequence, and are distinct from the colors of systems with
observed bars or strong disk instabilities. Even the most extreme
secular models, in which all bulge (and therefore BH) formation proceeds
via disk instability, are forced to assume that this instability acts
before the (dynamically inevitable) mergers, and therefore predict a
history for the quasar luminosity density that is shifted to earlier
times, in disagreement with observations. Our model provides a powerful
means to predict the abundance and nature of mergers and to contrast
cosmologically motivated predictions of merger products such as
starbursts and active galactic nuclei.

 abstract = "{Massive black hole binary coalescences are prime targets for space-based
gravitational wave (GW) observatories such as LISA. GW measurements can
localize the position of a coalescing binary on the sky to an ellipse
with a major axis of a few tens of arcminutes to a few degrees,
depending on source redshift, and a minor axis which is 2-4 times
smaller. Neglecting weak gravitational lensing, the GWs would also
determine the source's luminosity distance to better than percent
accuracy for close sources, degrading to several percent for more
distant sources. Weak lensing cannot, in fact, be neglected and is
expected to limit the accuracy with which distances can be fixed to
errors no less than a few percent. Assuming a well-measured cosmology,
the source's redshift could be inferred with similar accuracy. GWs alone
can thus pinpoint a binary to a three-dimensional ``pixel'' which can
help guide searches for the hosts of these events. We examine the time
evolution of this pixel, studying it at merger and at several intervals
before merger. One day before merger, the major axis of the error
ellipse is typically larger than its final value by a factor of \~{}1.5-6.
The minor axis is larger by a factor of \~{}2-9, and, neglecting lensing,
the error in the luminosity distance is larger by a factor of \~{}1.5-7.
This large change over a short period of time is due to spin-induced
precession, which is strongest in the final days before merger. The
evolution is slower as we go back further in time. For z=1, we find that
GWs will localize a coalescing binary to within \~{}10 deg^{2} as
early as a month prior to merger and determine distance (and hence
redshift) to several percent.

peaks at lower redshift and evolves more strongly at high redshift than
the star formation rate density, but the ratio of black hole to stellar
mass density shows only a moderate evolution at low redshifts. We find
strong correlations between BH masses and properties of the stellar
systems, agreeing well with the measured local M_{BH}-{$\sigma$}

(dependent on the mass range) a weak evolution with redshift in the

become simpler. For BH binaries with unequal masses but with equal spins

errors of a couple of percent at most. We also discuss how to use the
fit to predict when a Schwarzschild BH is produced by the merger of two
spinning BHs, when the total angular momentum of the spacetime ``flips''
sign, or under what conditions the final BH is ``spun up'' by the
merger. Finally, we suggest an extension of the fit to include
unequal-spin binaries, thus potentially providing a complete description

seeds formed in this way, we follow the mass assembly of these black
holes to the present time using a Monte Carlo merger tree. Using this
machinery, we predict the black hole mass function at high redshifts and
at the present time, the integrated mass density of black holes and the
luminosity function of accreting black holes as a function of redshift.
These predictions are made for a set of three seed models with varying
black hole formation efficiency. Given the accuracy of present
observational constraints, all three models can be adequately fitted.
Discrimination between the models appears predominantly at the low-mass
end of the present-day black hole mass function which is not
observationally well constrained. However, all our models predict that
low surface brightness, bulgeless galaxies with large discs are least
likely to be sites for the formation of massive seed black holes at high
redshifts. The efficiency of seed formation at high redshifts has a
direct influence on the black hole occupation fraction in galaxies at z
= 0. This effect is more pronounced for low-mass galaxies. This is the
key discriminant between the models studied here and the Population III
remnant seed model. We find that there exist a population of low-mass
galaxies that do not host nuclear black holes. Our prediction of the

simulations. Matching numerical results to PN waveforms early in the run
yields excellent agreement (within 0.05 radians) over the first

establishing a regime where PN theory is accurate. In the last 15 cycles
to merger, however, generic time-domain Taylor approximants build up
phase differences of several radians. But, apparently by coincidence,
one specific post-Newtonian approximant, TaylorT4 at 3.5PN order, agrees
much better with the numerical simulations, with accumulated phase
differences of less than 0.05 radians over the 30-cycle waveform.
Gravitational-wave amplitude comparisons are also done between numerical

difference is about 6\% 7\% for zeroth order and becomes smaller for
increasing order. A newly derived 3.0PN amplitude correction improves

momentum are of special interest, as studies indicate that this
configuration is preferred in nature due to non-vacuum environmental
interactions, as well as post-Newtonian (PN) spin-orbit couplings. If
the spins of the two bodies differ, there can be a prominent beaming of
the gravitational radiation during the late plunge, causing a recoil of
the final merged black hole. In this paper we perform an accurate and
systematic study of recoil velocities from a sequence of equal-mass
black holes whose spins are aligned with the orbital angular momentum,
and whose individual spins range from a=+0.584 to -0.584. In this way we
extend and refine the results of a previous study which concentrated on
the antialigned portion of this sequence, to arrive at a consistent
maximum recoil of 448{\plusmn}5km/s for antialigned models as well as to
a phenomenological expression for the recoil velocity as a function of
spin ratio. Quite surprisingly, this relation highlights a nonlinear
behavior, not predicted by the PN estimates, and can be readily employed
in astrophysical studies on the evolution of binary black holes in
massive galaxies. An essential result of our analysis, without which no
systematic behavior can be found, is the identification of different
stages in the waveform, including a transient due to lack of an initial
linear momentum in the initial data. Furthermore, by decomposing the
recoil computation into coupled modes, we are able to identify a pair of
terms which are largely responsible for the kick, indicating that an
accurate computation can be obtained from modes up to {\ell}=3. Finally,
we provide accurate measures of the radiated energy and angular
momentum, finding these to increase linearly with the spin ratio, and
derive simple expressions for the final spin and the radiated angular
momentum which can be easily implemented in N-body simulations of
compact stellar systems. Our code is calibrated with strict convergence
tests and we verify the correctness of our measurements by using
multiple independent methods whenever possible.

the semi-analytical galaxy formation model based on {$\Lambda$}CDM proposed
by Baugh et al. Our black hole model has one free parameter, which we
set by matching the observed zero-point of the local correlation between
black hole mass and bulge luminosity. We present predictions for the
evolution with redshift of the relationships between black hole mass and
bulge properties. Our simulations reproduce the evolution of the optical
luminosity function of quasars. We study the demographics of the black
hole population and address the issue of how black holes acquire their
mass. We find that the direct accretion of cold gas during starbursts is
an important growth mechanism for lower mass black holes and at high
redshift. On the other hand, the re-assembly of pre-existing black hole
mass into larger units via merging dominates the growth of more massive
black holes at low redshift. This prediction could be tested by future
gravitational wave experiments. As redshift decreases, progressively
less massive black holes have the highest fractional growth rates, in
line with recent claims of `downsizing' in quasar activity.

that the BHFP can be understood roughly as a tilted intrinsic
correlation between BH mass and spheroid binding energy, or the
condition for feedback coupling to power a pressure-driven outflow.
While changes in halo circular velocity, merger orbital parameters,
progenitor disk redshifts and gas fractions, ISM gas pressurization, and
other parameters can drive changes in, e.g., {$\sigma$} at fixed
M_{*}, and therefore changes in the M_{BH}-{$\sigma$} or
M_{BH}-M_{*} relations, the BHFP is robust. Given the
empirical trend of decreasing R_{e} for a given M_{*} at
high redshift (i.e., increasingly deep potential wells), the BHFP
predicts that BHs will be more massive at fixed M_{*}, in good
agreement with recent observations. This evolution in the structural
properties of merger remnants, to smaller R_{e} and larger
{$\sigma$} (and therefore larger M_{BH}, conserving the BHFP) at a
given M_{*}, is driven by the fact that disks (merger
progenitors) have characteristically larger gas fractions at high
redshifts. Adopting the observed evolution of disk gas fractions with
redshift, our simulations predict the observed trends in both
R_{e}(M_{*}) and M_{BH}(M_{*}). The
existence of this BHFP also has important implications for the masses of
the very largest black holes and immediately resolves several apparent
conflicts between the BH masses expected and measured for outliers in
both the M_{BH}-{$\sigma$} and M_{BH}-M_{*}

study how the match between two numerical waveforms varies with
numerical resolution, initial angular momentum of the black holes, and
the inclination angle between the source and the detector. This study is
limited by the fact that the spinning black-hole binaries are oriented
axially and the waveforms only contain approximately two and a half
orbits before merger. We find that for detection purposes, spinning
black holes require the inclusion of the higher harmonics in addition to
the dominant mode, a condition that becomes more important as the
black-hole spins increase. In addition, we conduct a preliminary
investigation of how well a template of fixed spin and inclination angle
can detect target templates of arbitrary but nonprecessing spin and

three different definitions for the ringdown starting time. Applying
linear-estimation methods (the so-called Prony methods) to the ringdown

orbital and phase configurations on the hierarchical evolution of the
massive black hole (MBH) population. The orbital configuration and spin
orientation in the plane is chosen to be the one yielding the highest
possible kick. Masses and spin magnitudes are instead derived
self-consistently from the MBH evolutionary models. If seeds form early,
for example, as remnants of the first stars, almost the totality of the
first few generation of binaries are ejected. The fraction of  lost
binaries decreases at later times due to a combination of the binary
mass ratio distribution becoming shallower, and the deepening of the
hosts' potential wells. If seeds form at later times, in more massive
halos, then the retention rate is much higher. We show that the
gravitational recoil does not pose a threat to the evolution of the MBH
population that we observe locally in either case, although high-mass
seeds seem to be favored. The gravitational recoil is instead a real
hazard for (1) MBHs in biased halos at high redshift, where mergers are
more common and the potential wells still relatively shallow. Similarly,
it is very challenging to retain (2) MBHs merging in star clusters.

Until recently it has been impossible to reliably derive the predictions
of general relativity for the final merger stage, which takes place in
the strong-field regime. Recent progress in numerical relativity
simulations is, however, revolutionizing our understanding of these
systems. We examine here the specific case of merging equal-mass
Schwarzschild black holes in detail, presenting new simulations in which
the black holes start in the late-inspiral stage on orbits with very low
eccentricity and evolve for {\tilde}1200M through {\tilde}7 orbits before
merging. We study the accuracy and consistency of our simulations and
the resulting gravitational waveforms, which encompass {\tilde}14cycle
before merger, and highlight the importance of using frequency (rather
than time) to set the physical reference when comparing models. Matching
our results to post-Newtonian (PN) calculations for the earlier parts of
the inspiral provides a combined waveform with less than one cycle of
accumulated phase error through the entire coalescence. Using this
waveform, we calculate signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) for iLIGO, adLIGO,
and LISA, highlighting the contributions from the late-inspiral and
merger-ringdown parts of the waveform, which can now be simulated
numerically. Contour plots of SNR as a function of z and M show that
adLIGO can achieve SNR{\gsim}10 for some intermediate mass binary black

and used quasiequilibrium initial-data sets constructed by Cook and
Pfeiffer. Results from the evolution of three sets of initial data are
explored in detail, corresponding to different initial separations of
the black holes, and exhibit between 2 8 GW cycles before coalescence.
We find that to a good approximation the inspiral phase of the evolution
is quasicircular, followed by a {\ldquo}blurred, quasicircular
plunge{\rdquo} lasting for about 1 1.5 GW cycles. After this plunge the
GW frequency decouples from the orbital frequency, and we define this
time to be the start of the merger phase. Roughly 10 15 M separates the
time between the beginning of the merger phase and when we are able to
extract quasinormal ring-down modes from gravitational waves emitted by
the newly formed black hole. This suggests that the merger lasts for a
correspondingly short amount of time, approximately 0.5 0.75 of a full
GW cycle. We present first-order comparisons between analytical models
of the various stages of the merger and the numerical results{\mdash}more
detailed and accurate comparisons will need to await numerical
simulations with higher accuracy, better control of systemic errors
(including coordinate artifacts), and initial configurations where the
binaries are further separated. During the inspiral, we find that if the
orbital phase is well modeled, the leading order Newtonian quadrupole
formula is able to match both the amplitude and phase of the numerical
GW quite accurately until close to the point of merger. We provide
comparisons between the numerical results and analytical predictions
based on the adiabatic post-Newtonian (PN) and nonadiabatic resummed-PN
models (effective-one-body and Pad{\'e} models). For all models
considered, 3PN and 3.5PN orders match the inspiral numerical data the
best. From the ring-down portion of the GW, we extract the fundamental
quasinormal mode and several of the overtones. Finally, we estimate the
optimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for typical binaries detectable by
GW experiments. We find that, when the merger and ring-down phases are
included, binaries with total mass larger than 40M_{ȯ}

detected with signal-to-noise up to {\ap}15 at 100 Mpc, whereas for

hole cosmic evolution using future GW space-borne missions, such as
LISA. We consider two main scenarios for black hole formation, namely,
one where seeds are light (\~{}=10^{2}M_{solar}, remnant of
Population III stars) and one where seeds are heavy
({\gt}\~{}10^{4}M_{solar}, direct collapse). In all the
models we have investigated, MBH binary coalescences do not produce a
stochastic GW background, but rather, a set of individual resolved
events. Detection of several hundreds merging events in a 3-yr LISA
mission will be the sign of a heavy seed scenario with efficient
formation of black hole seeds in a large fraction of high-redshift
haloes. At the other extreme, a low event rate, about a few tens in 3
yr, is peculiar of scenarios where either the seeds are light, and many
coalescences do not fall into the LISA band, or seeds are massive, but
rare. In this case a decisive diagnostic is provided by the shape of the
mass distribution of detected events. Light binaries (m {\lt}
10^{4}M_{solar}) are predicted in a fairly large number
in Population III remnant models, but are totally absent in direct
collapse models. Finally, a further, helpful diagnostic of black hole
formation models lies in the distribution of the mass ratios in binary
coalescences. While heavy seed models predict that most of the detected
events involve equal-mass binaries, in the case of light seeds, mass
ratios are equally distributed in the range 0.1-1.

interaction in a near-circular orbit, stays there for an amount of time
proportional to the logarithmic distance from the threshold in parameter
space, then either separates or merges to form a single Kerr black hole.
To gain a better understanding of this phenomenon, we study an analogous
problem in the evolution of equatorial geodesics about a central Kerr
black hole. A similar threshold of capture exists for appropriate
classes of initial conditions, and tuning to threshold the geodesics
approach one of the unstable circular geodesics of the Kerr spacetime.
Remarkably, with a natural mapping of the parameters of the geodesic to
that of the equal mass system, the scaling exponents describing the
whirl phase of each system turn out to be quite similar. Armed with this
lone piece of evidence that an approximate correspondence might exist
between near-threshold evolution of geodesics and generic binary
mergers, we illustrate how this information can be used to estimate the
cross section and energy emitted in the ultra-relativistic black hole
scattering problem. This could eventually be of use in providing
estimates for the related problem of parton collisions at the large

relationship conflict with predictions from the M_{•}-L
relationship for high-luminosity galaxies, such as brightest cluster
galaxies (BCGs). The M_{•}-L relationship predicts that
some BCGs may harbor BHs with M_{•} approaching
10^{10} M_{solar}, while the M_{•}-{$\sigma$}
relationship always predicts
M_{•}{\lt}3{\times}10^{9} M_{solar}. We argue
that the M_{•}-L relationship is a plausible description
for galaxies of high luminosity. If the cores in central stellar density
are formed by binary BHs, the inner core cusp radius,
r_{γ}, may be an independent witness of
M_{•}. Using central structural parameters derived from a
large sample of early-type galaxies observed by HST, we argue that L is
superior to {$\sigma$} as an indicator of r_{γ}. Further, the
r_{γ}-M_{•} relationship for 11 core galaxies
with measured M_{•} appears to be consistent with the
M_{•}-L relationship for BCGs. BCGs have large cores
appropriate for their large luminosities that may be difficult to
generate with the more modest BH masses inferred from the
M_{•}-{$\sigma$} relationship. M_{•}\~{}M would be
expected for BCGs, if they were formed in dissipationless mergers, which
should preserve the ratio of BH to stellar mass, M. This scenario
appears to be consistent with the slow increase in {$\sigma$} with L and
the more rapid increase in effective radii with L seen in BCGs as
compared to less luminous galaxies. If BCGs have large BHs commensurate
with their luminosities, then the local BH mass function for
M_{•}{\gt}3{\times}10^{9} M_{solar} would be
nearly an order of magnitude richer than that inferred from the
M_{•}-{$\sigma$} relationship. The volume density of the most
luminous QSOs may favor the M_{•}-L relationship.

 abstract = "{Double black hole binaries are among the most important sources of
gravitational radiation for ground-based detectors such as LIGO or
VIRGO. Even if formed with lower efficiency than double neutron star
binaries, they could dominate the predicted detection rates, since black
holes are more massive than neutron stars and therefore could be
detected at greater distances. Here we discuss an evolutionary process
that could very significantly limit the formation of close double black
hole binaries: the vast majority of their potential progenitors undergo
a common-envelope (CE) phase while the donor, one of the massive binary
components, is evolving through the Hertzsprung gap. Our latest
theoretical understanding of the CE process suggests that this will
probably lead to a merger, inhibiting double black hole formation.
Barring uncertainties in the physics of CE evolution, we use population
synthesis calculations and find that the corresponding reduction in the
merger rate of double black holes formed in galactic fields is so great
(by \~{}500) that their contribution to inspiral detection rates for
ground-based detectors could become relatively small (\~{}1 in 10) compared
to double neutron star binaries. A similar process also reduces the
merger rates for double neutron stars, by a factor of \~{}5, eliminating
most of the previously predicted ultracompact NS-NS systems. Our
predicted detection rates for Advanced LIGO are now much lower for
double black holes (\~{}2 yr^{-1}), but are still quite high for
double neutron stars (\~{}20 yr^{-1}). If double black holes were
found to be dominant in the detected inspiral signals, this could
indicate that they mainly originate from dense star clusters (not
included here) or that our theoretical understanding of the CE phase
requires significant revision.

gaseous disc around a supermassive black hole (SMBH). We analyse the
dynamics of a disc forming around an SMBH, in which the angular momentum
is transported by turbulence induced by the disc's self-gravity. We find
that once the surface density of the disc exceeds a critical value, the
disc fragments into dense clumps. We argue that the clumps accrete
material from the remaining disc and merge into larger clumps; the upper
mass of a merged clump is a few tens to a few hundreds of solar mass.

This picture fits well with the observed young stellar discs near the
SgrA* black hole in the Galactic Centre. In particular, we show how the
masses and spatial distribution of the young stars, and the total mass
in the Galactic Centre discs can be explained. However, explaining the
origin of the several young stars closest to the black hole (the
S-stars) is more problematic: their orbits are compact, eccentric, and
have random orientation. We propose that the S-stars were born in a
previous starburst(s), and then migrated through their parent disc via
type-I or runaway migration. Their orbits were then randomized by the
Rauch-Tremaine resonant relaxation.

We then explore the consequences of the star formation scenario for AGN
discs, which are continuously resupplied with gas. We argue that some
compact remnants generated by the starburst will get embedded in the
disc. The disc-born stellar mass black holes will interact
gravitationally with the massive accretion disc and be dragged towards
the central black hole. Merger of a disc-born black hole with the
central black hole will produce a burst of gravitational waves. If the
central black hole is accreting at a rate comparable to the Eddington
limit, the gas drag from the accretion disc will not alter significantly
the dynamics of the final year of merger, and the gravitational waves
should be observable by Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). For a
reasonable range of parameters such mergers will be detected monthly,
and that the gravitational-wave signal from these mergers is distinct
from that of other merger scenarios. Also, for some plausible black hole
masses and accretion rates, the burst of gravitational waves should be
accompanied by a detectable change in the optical luminosity of the
central engine.

the spin-orbit coupling is far too weak to tidally lock the binary to a
corotating state during the late-inspiral phase. We also study the
converse transfer from spin into orbital motion. In this case, we start
the simulations with parallel, highly-spinning nonboosted black holes.
As the collision proceeds, the system acquires a non-head-on orbital

gas in dark matter haloes can lose angular momentum rapidly via runaway,
global dynamical instabilities, the so-called `bars within bars'
mechanism. This leads to the rapid build-up of a dense, self-gravitating
core supported by gas pressure - surrounded by a radiation
pressure-dominated envelope - which gradually contracts and is
compressed further by subsequent infall. We show that these conditions
lead to such high temperatures in the central region that the gas cools
catastrophically by thermal neutrino emission, leading to the formation
and rapid growth of a central black hole.

We estimate the initial mass and growth rate of the black hole for
typical conditions in metal-free haloes with T_{vir} \~{}
10^{4}K, which are the most likely to be susceptible to runaway
infall. The initial black hole should have a mass of {\lt}\~{}20
M_{solar}, but in principle could grow at a super-Eddington rate
until it reaches \~{}10^{4}-10^{6} M_{solar}. Rapid
growth may be limited by feedback from the accretion process and/or
disruption of the mass supply by star formation or halo mergers. Even if
super-Eddington growth stops at \~{}10^{3}-10^{4}
M_{solar}, this process would give black holes ample time to
attain quasar-size masses by a redshift of 6, and could also provide the
seeds for all SMBHs seen in the present Universe.

performed in the framework of full general relativity. We pay particular
attention to the black hole formation case and to the resulting mass of
the surrounding disk for exploring the possibility for formation of the
central engine of short-duration gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs). Hybrid
equations of state are adopted mimicking realistic, stiff nuclear
equations of state (EOSs), for which the maximum allowed gravitational
mass of cold and spherical neutron stars, M_{sph}, is larger
than 2M_{ȯ}. Such stiff EOSs are adopted motivated by the
recent possible discovery of a heavy neutron star of mass
{\tilde}2.1{\plusmn}0.2M_{ȯ}. For the simulations, we focus
on binary neutron stars of the ADM mass M{\gsim}2.6M_{ȯ}.
For an ADM mass larger than the threshold mass M_{thr}, the
merger results in prompt formation of a black hole irrespective of the
mass ratio Q_{M} with 0.65{\lsim}Q_{M}{\le}1. The value of
M_{thr} depends on the EOSs and is approximately written as 1.3
1.35M_{sph} for the chosen EOSs. For the black hole formation
case, we evolve the space-time using a black hole excision technique and
determine the mass of a quasistationary disk surrounding the black hole.
The disk mass steeply increases with decreasing the value of
Q_{M} for given ADM mass and EOS. This suggests that a merger
with small value of Q_{M} is a candidate for producing central
engine of SGRBs. For M{\lt}M_{thr}, the outcome is a hypermassive
neutron star of a large ellipticity. Because of the nonaxisymmetry,
angular momentum is transported outward. If the hypermassive neutron
star collapses to a black hole after the long-term angular momentum
transport, the disk mass may be {\gsim}0.01M_{ȯ}
irrespective of Q_{M}. Gravitational waves are computed in terms
of a gauge-invariant wave extraction technique. In the formation of the
hypermassive neutron star, quasiperiodic gravitational waves of
frequency between 3 and 3.5 kHz are emitted irrespective of EOSs. The
effective amplitude of gravitational waves can be
{\gsim}5{\times}10^{-21} at a distance of 50 Mpc, and hence, it
may be detected by advanced laser-interferometers. For the black hole
formation case, the black hole excision technique enables a long-term
computation and extraction of ring-down gravitational waves associated
with a black hole quasinormal mode. It is found that the frequency and
amplitude are {\ap}6.5 7kHz and {\tilde}10^{-22} at a distance of
50 Mpc for the binary of mass M{\ap}2.7 2.9M_{ȯ}.

relatively short initial burst of spurious radiation, is oscillatory

a maximum corresponding to the ``break'' in the observed luminosity

the strongest sources of gravitational waves to be observed by LISA.
While the formation of binary SBHs during galaxy mergers is almost
inevitable, coalescence requires that the separation between binary
components first drop by a few orders of magnitude, due presumably to
interaction of the binary with stars and gas in a galactic nucleus. This
article reviews the observational evidence for binary SBHs and discusses
how they would evolve. No completely convincing case of a bound, binary
SBH has yet been found, although a handful of systems (e.g. interacting
galaxies; remnants of galaxy mergers) are now believed to contain two
SBHs at projected separations of {\lt}\~{} 1kpc. N-body studies of binary
evolution in gas-free galaxies have reached large enough particle
numbers to reproduce the slow, ''diffusive'' refilling of the binary's
loss cone that is believed to characterize binary evolution in real
galactic nuclei. While some of the results of these simulations - e.g.
the binary hardening rate and eccentricity evolution - are strongly
N-dependent, others - e.g. the ''damage'' inflicted by the binary on the
nucleus - are not. Luminous early-type galaxies often exhibit depleted
cores with masses of \~{} 1-2 times the mass of their nuclear SBHs,
consistent with the predictions of the binary model. Studies of the
interaction of massive binaries with gas are still in their infancy,
although much progress is expected in the near future. Binary
coalescence has a large influence on the spins of SBHs, even for mass
ratios as extreme as 10:1, and evidence of spin-flips may have been
observed.

fact effective in these comparatively massive halos. The cooling and
collapse of an initially spherical configuration of gas leads to a
rotationally supported disk at the center of the halo if baryons
preserve their specific angular momentum during collapse. The conditions
for the formation of the gas disk and accretion onto central black holes

growth, but for most of the duration of the starburst, the black hole is
``buried,'' being heavily obscured by surrounding gas and dust, limiting
the visibility of the quasar, especially at optical and ultraviolet

heats the gas and eventually expels it in a powerful wind, leaving
behind a ``dead quasar.'' Between the buried and dead phases, there is a
window in time during which the galaxy would be seen as a luminous
quasar. Because the black hole mass, radiative output, and distribution
of obscuring gas and dust all evolve strongly with time, the duration of
this phase of observable quasar activity depends on both the waveband
and imposed luminosity threshold. We determine the observed and
intrinsic lifetimes as a function of luminosity and frequency, and
calculate observable lifetimes \~{}10 Myr for bright quasars in the optical
B band, in good agreement with empirical estimates and much smaller than
our estimated black hole growth timescales \~{}100 Myr, naturally producing
a substantial population of buried quasars. However, the observed and
intrinsic energy outputs converge in the IR and hard X-ray bands as
attenuation becomes weaker and chances of observation greatly increase.
We also obtain the distribution of column densities along sight lines in
which the quasar is seen above a given luminosity, and find that our
result agrees remarkably well with observed estimates of the column
density distribution from the SDSS for the appropriate luminosity
thresholds. Our model reproduces a wide range of quasar phenomena,
including observed quasar lifetimes, intrinsic lifetimes, column density
distributions, and differences between optical and X-ray samples, having
properties consistent with observations across more than 5 orders of
magnitude in bolometric luminosity from 10^{9} to
10^{14} L_{solar} (-17{\lt}\~{}M_{B}{\lt}\~{}-30).

effects of gas on the in-spiral and merger of a massive black hole

observed in the central regions of merging galaxies. Here we present
results that expand on the treatment in a previous work by studying
models in which the gas is in a disk. We run a variety of models,
ranging from simulations with a relatively smooth gas disk to cases in
which the gas has a more clumpy spatial distribution. We also vary the
inclination angle between the plane of the binary and the plane of the
disk, and the mass ratio between the MBHs and the gaseous disk. We find
that, as in our previous work, in the early evolution of the system the
binary separation diminishes mainly due to dynamical friction exerted by
the background gas, and in the later stages the gaseous medium responds
by forming an ellipsoidal density enhancement whose axis lags behind the
binary axis. This offset produces a gravitational torque on the binary
that causes continuing loss of angular momentum and is able to reduce
the separation to distances at which gravitational radiation is
efficient. The main difference is that between these two regimes we now
find a new transition regime that was not apparent in our previous
paper, in which the evolution is temporarily slowed down when neither of
these mechanisms is fully effective. In the variety of simulations that
we perform, we find that the coalescence timescale for the MBH binary
varies between 5{\times}10^{6} and 2.5{\times}10^{7} yr
for typical ULIRGs. For MBHs that satisfy the observed
``m-{$\sigma$}_{c}'' relation, our simulations suggest that in a
merger of galaxies that have at least 1\% of their total mass in gas, the
MBHs will coalesce soon after the galaxies merge.

forming coarse-grained representations of the properties of the
interstellar medium (ISM) and BH accretion starting from basic physical
assumptions, so that the impact of these effects can be included on
resolved scales. We illustrate our method using a multiphase description
of star-forming gas. Feedback from star formation pressurizes highly
overdense gas, altering its effective equation of state (EOS). We show
that this allows the construction of stable galaxy models with much
larger gas fractions than possible in earlier numerical work. We extend
the model by including a treatment of gas accretion onto central
supermassive BHs in galaxies. Assuming thermal coupling of a small
fraction of the bolometric luminosity of accreting BHs to the
surrounding gas, we show how this feedback regulates the growth of BHs.
In gas-rich mergers of galaxies, we observe a complex interplay between
starbursts and central active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity when the
tidal interaction triggers intense nuclear inflows of gas. Once an
accreting supermassive BH has grown to a critical size, feedback
terminates its further growth and expels gas from the central region in
a powerful quasar-driven wind. Our simulation methodology is therefore
able to address the coupled processes of gas dynamics, star formation
and BH accretion during the formation of galaxies.

galaxy can be entirely disrupted before the merger is completed, leaving
its SMBH wandering at a distance too far from the center of the remnant
for the formation of a close pair. In contrast, gas cooling facilitates
the pairing process by increasing the resilience of the companion galaxy
to tidal disruption. Moreover, we demonstrate that merging disk galaxies
constructed to obey the M_{BH}-{$\sigma$} relation move relative to
it depending on whether they undergo a dissipational or collisionless
merger, regardless of the mass ratio of the merging systems.
Collisionless simulations reveal that remnants tend to move away from
the mean relation, highlighting the role of gas-poor mergers as a

between strong gas inflows associated with the formation of massive

released by the quasar expels enough gas to quench both star formation

Comparing simulations with and without black holes, we show that AGN
feedback can quench star formation and accretion on a short timescale,
particularly in large galaxies where the black holes can drive powerful

remnant differs markedly between mergers with and without central black
holes. Without AGNs, gas-rich mergers lead to elliptical galaxies that
remain blue owing to residual star formation, even after more than 7 Gyr
have elapsed. In contrast, mergers with black holes produce elliptical
galaxies that redden much faster, an effect that is more pronounced in
massive remnants where a nearly complete termination of star formation
occurs, allowing them to redden to u-r\~{}=2.3 in less than 1 Gyr. AGN

of the MBHs they host, and their growth via gas accretion and binary
coalescences. The coalescence of comparable-mass holes increases the
spin of MBHs, while the capture of smaller companions in randomly
oriented orbits acts to spin holes down. We find that, given the
distribution of MBH binary mass ratios in hierarchical models, binary
coalescences alone do not lead to a systematic spin-up or spin-down of
MBHs with time: the spin distribution retains memory of its initial
conditions. By contrast, because of the alignment of a MBH with the
angular momentum of the outer accretion disk, gas accretion tends to
spin holes up even if the direction of the spin axis varies in time. In
our models, accretion dominates over black hole captures and efficiently
spins holes up. The spin distribution is heavily skewed toward
fast-rotating Kerr holes, is already in place at early epochs, and does
not change much below redshift 5. If accretion is via a thin disk, about
70\% of all MBHs are maximally rotating and have radiative efficiencies
approaching 30\% (assuming a ``standard'' spin-efficiency conversion).
Even in the conservative case in which accretion is via a geometrically
thick disk, about 80\% of all MBHs have spin parameters
a/m_{BH}{\gt}0.8 and accretion efficiencies {\gt}12\%. Rapidly
spinning holes with high radiative efficiencies may satisfy constraints
based on comparing the local MBH mass density with the mass density
inferred from luminous quasars (Soltan's argument). Since most holes
rotate rapidly at all epochs, our results suggest that spin is not a
necessary and sufficient condition for producing a radio-loud quasar.

supermassive black holes form out of the lowest angular momentum gas in
protogalaxies at high redshift. We show that, under reasonable
assumptions, this leads naturally to a correlation between black hole
masses and spheroid properties, as observed today. We assume that the
gas in early-forming, rare-peak haloes has a distribution of specific
angular momentum similar to that derived for the dark matter in
cosmological N-body simulations. This distribution has a significant low
angular momentum tail, which implies that every protogalaxy should
contain gas that ends up in a high-density disc. In haloes more massive
than a critical threshold of \~{}7 {\times} 10^{7} M_{solar}
at z\~{} 15, the discs are gravitationally unstable, and experience an
efficient Lin-Pringle viscosity that transfers angular momentum outwards
and allows mass inflow. We assume that this process continues until the
first massive stars disrupt the disc. The seed black holes created in
this manner have a characteristic mass of \~{}10^{5}
M_{solar}, roughly independent of the redshift of formation.
This serves as a lower bound for black hole masses at galactic centres
today. The comoving mass density in black hole seeds grows with time,
tracking the continuous production of critical-mass haloes, and
saturates when cosmic reionization acts to prevent gas cooling in these
low-mass systems. By z\~{} 15, the comoving mass density becomes comparable
to that inferred from observations, with room for appropriate additional
luminous growth during a later quasar accretion phase. The hierarchical
merger process after z\~{} 15 naturally leads to a linear correlation
between black hole mass and stellar spheroid mass, with negligible black
hole masses in disc-dominated galaxies. The formation of massive seeds
at high redshifts, and the relatively important role of mergers in the
buildup of today's black holes, are key elements in the proposed
scenario.

build-up of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the nuclei of galaxies,
based on observations of the evolving radio and (hard) X-ray luminosity
functions of active galactic nuclei (AGN). The fundamental plane of
black hole activity discovered by Merloni, Heinz {\amp} Di Matteo, which
defines a universal correlation among black hole mass (M), 2-10keV X-ray
luminosity and 5-GHz radio luminosity is used as a mass and accretion
rate estimator, provided a specific functional form for the dependency
of the X-ray luminosity on the dimensionless accretion rate mdot is
assumed. I adopt the local black hole mass function (BHMF) as derived
from the velocity dispersion ({$\sigma$}) distributions of nearby galaxies
coupled with the M-{$\sigma$} relation as a boundary condition to integrate
backwards in time the continuity equation for the evolution of SMBH,
neglecting the role of mergers in shaping up the BHMF. Under the most
general assumption that, independently on M, black hole accretion
proceeds in a radiatively efficient way above a certain rate, and in a
radiatively inefficient way below it, the redshift evolution of the BHMF
and the black hole accretion rate (BHAR) function (i.e. the distribution
of the Eddington scaled accretion rates for objects of any given mass)
are calculated self-consistently. The only tunable parameters are the
overall efficiency of extracting gravitational energy from the accreting
gas, {$\epsilon$}, and the critical ratio of the X-ray to Eddington
luminosity, L_{2-10keV,cr}/L_{Edd}{\equiv}x_{cr},
at which the transition between accretion modes takes place. For
fiducial values of these parameters ({$\epsilon$}= 0.1 and x_{cr}=
10^{-3}), I found that half (\~{}85 per cent) of the local black
hole mass density was accumulated at redshift z {\lt} 1 (z {\lt} 3),
mostly in radiatively efficient episodes of accretion. The evolution of
the BHMF between z= 0 and z\~{} 3 shows clear signs of an anti-hierarchical
behaviour: while the majority of the most massive objects (M{\gt}\~{}
10^{9}) were already in place at z\~{} 3, lower mass ones mainly
grew at progressively lower redshift, so that the average black hole
mass increases with increasing redshift. In addition, the average
accretion rate decreases towards lower redshift. Consequently, sources
in the radiatively inefficient regime of accretion only begin to
dominate the comoving accretion energy density in the Universe at z {\lt}
1 (with the exact value of z depending on x_{cr}), while at the
peak of the BHAR history, radiatively efficient accretion dominates by
almost an order of magnitude. I will discuss the implications of these
results for the efficiency of accretion on to SMBH, the lifetimes of
quasars and duty cycles, the history of AGN feedback in the form of
mechanical energy output and, more generally, for the cosmological
models of structure formation in the Universe.

of partial ionization due to X-rays produced by black hole (BH)
accretion in small-mass galaxies at redshifts 7 {\lt} z {\lt} 20. This is
followed by complete reionization by stellar sources at z\~{}= 7. This
scenario is motivated by the large optical depth to Thomson scattering,
{$\tau$}_{e}\~{}= 0.17 +/- 0.04, recently measured by the Wilkinson
Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP). However, it is also consistent with
the observed Gunn-Peterson trough in the spectra of quasars at z\~{} 5-6.
We use a semi-analytic code to explore models with different BH
accretion histories and cosmological parameters. We find that
`pre-ionization' by X-rays can increase the intergalactic medium (IGM)
optical depth from {$\tau$}_{e}\~{} 0.06 given by stellar sources
only, to 0.1 {\lt}\~{}{$\tau$}_{e}{\lt}\~{} 0.2, if a fraction of baryons
10^{-5}{\lt}\~{}{$\omega$}_{ac}{\lt}\~{} 10^{-4} is
accreted on to seed BHs produced in the collapse of low-metallicity,
high-mass stars before z\~{}= 15. To be effective, pre-ionization requires
a non-negligible star formation in the first small-mass galaxies in
which seed BHs are formed. By z\~{} 20-25 the IGM is reheated to 10000 K
and the ionization fraction is about 20 per cent. The increase of the
IGM Jeans mass is effective in reducing star formation in the smaller
mass haloes. Large values of {$\tau$}_{e} are obtained in models
with top-heavy stellar initial mass function only if pair-instability
supernovae (SNe) are not important. Seed BHs are assumed to accrete at
near the Eddington limit with a duty cycle that decreases slowly with
increasing time. Alternatively, a moderate fraction of the black holes
must be ejected from the host galaxy or exist without merging into the
supermassive BHs in galactic centres. The model predicts that dwarf
spheroidal galaxies, if they are preserved fossils of the first
galaxies, may host a mass in BHs that is 5-40 per cent of their stellar
mass. The redshifted X-ray background produced by this early epoch of BH
accretion constitutes about 5-10 per cent of the hard X-ray background
in the 2-50keV bands and roughly half of the currently estimated BH mass
density was formed at early times. Moreover, in most models, the photons
from the redshifted background are sufficient to fully reionize HeII at
redshift z\~{} 3 without any additional contribution from quasars at lower
redshifts and the temperature of the mean density IGM remains close to

coalescing massive black hole (MBH) binaries at the center of galaxies

intermediate mass form far up in the dark halo ``merger tree.'' The
merger history of dark matter halos and associated MBHs is followed via
cosmological Monte Carlo realizations of the merger hierarchy from

incorporated through halo mergers into larger and larger structures,
sink to the center because of dynamical friction against the dark matter
background, accrete cold material in the merger remnant, and form MBH
binary systems. Stellar dynamical (three-body) interactions cause the
hardening of the binary at large separations, while gravitational wave
emission takes over at small radii and leads to the final coalescence of
the pair. A simple scheme is applied in which the ``loss cone'' is
constantly refilled and a constant stellar density core forms because of
the ejection of stars by the shrinking binary. The integrated emission
from inspiraling MBH binaries at all redshifts is computed in the
quadrupole approximation and results in a gravitational wave background
(GWB) with a well-defined shape that reflects the different mechanisms
driving the late orbital evolution. The characteristic strain spectrum
has the standard h_{c}(f)\~{}f^{-2/3} behavior only in the
range f=10^{-9}to10^{-6} Hz. At lower frequencies the
orbital decay of MBH binaries is driven by the ejection of background
stars (``gravitational slingshot''), and the strain amplitude increases
with frequency, h_{c}(f)\~{}f. In this range the GWB is dominated
by 10^{9}-10^{10} M_{solar} MBH pairs coalescing
at 0{\lt}\~{}z{\lt}\~{}2. At higher frequencies, f{\gt}10^{-6}Hz, the
strain amplitude, as steep as h_{c}(f)\~{}f^{-1.3}, is
shaped by the convolution of last stable circular orbit emission by
lighter binaries (10^{2}-10^{7} M_{solar})
populating galaxy halos at all redshifts. We discuss the observability
of inspiraling MBH binaries by a low-frequency gravitational wave
experiment such as the planned Laser Interferometer Space Antenna
(LISA). Over a 3 yr observing period LISA should resolve this GWB into
discrete sources, detecting \~{}60 (\~{}250) individual events above an S/N=5

 abstract = "{We quantify the importance of mass accretion during active galactic
nuclei (AGN) phases in the growth of supermassive black holes (BHs) by
comparing the mass function of black holes in the Local Universe with
that expected from AGN relics, which are black holes grown entirely with
mass accretion during AGN phases. The local BH mass function (BHMF) is
estimated by applying the well-known correlations between BH mass, bulge
luminosity and stellar velocity dispersion to galaxy luminosity and
velocity functions. We find that different correlations provide the same
BHMF only if they have the same intrinsic dispersion. The density of
supermassive black holes in the Local Universe that we estimate is
{$\rho$}_{BH}=
4.6^{+1.9}_{-1.4}h^{2}_{0.7}{\times}
10^{5} M_{solar} Mpc^{-3}. The relic BHMF is
derived from the continuity equation with the only assumption that AGN
activity is due to accretion on to massive BHs and that merging is not
important. We find that the relic BHMF at z= 0 is generated mainly at z
{\lt} 3 where the major part of the growth of a BH takes place. Moreover,
BH growth is antihierarchical in the sense that smaller BHs
(M_{BH} {\lt} 10^{7} M_{solar}) grow at lower
redshifts (z {\lt} 1) with respect to more massive ones (z\~{} 1-3). Unlike
previous work, we find that the BHMF of AGN relics is perfectly
consistent with the local BHMF, indicating that local BHs were mainly
grown during AGN activity. This agreement is obtained while satisfying,
at the same time, the constraints imposed from the X-ray background
(XRB). The comparison between the local and relic BHMFs also suggests
that the merging process is not important in shaping the relic BHMF, at
least at low redshifts (z {\lt} 3), and allows us to estimate the average
radiative efficiency ({$\epsilon$}), the ratio between emitted and
Eddington luminosity ({$\lambda$}) and the average lifetime of active BHs.
Our analysis thus suggests the following scenario: local BHs grew during
AGN phases in which accreting matter was converted into radiation with
efficiencies {$\epsilon$}= 0.04-0.16 and emitted at a fraction {$\lambda$}=
0.1-1.7 of the Eddington luminosity. The average total lifetime of these
active phases ranges from \~{}= 4.5 {\times} 10^{8} yr for
M_{BH} {\lt} 10^{8} M_{solar} to \~{}= 1.5 {\times}
10^{8} yr for M_{BH} {\gt} 10^{9}
M_{solar}, but can become as large as \~{}10^{9} yr for the
lowest acceptable {$\epsilon$} and {$\lambda$} values.

simulations, we investigate the effects of gas on the in-spiral and
merger of a massive black hole binary. This study is motivated by both
observational and theoretical work that indicate the presence of large
amounts of gas in the central regions of merging galaxies. N-body
simulations have shown that the coalescence of a massive black hole
binary eventually stalls in a stellar background. However, our
simulations suggest that the massive black hole binary will finally
merge if it is embedded in a gaseous background. Here we present results
in which the gas is assumed to be initially spherical with a relatively
smooth distribution. In the early evolution of the binary, the
separation decreases as a result of the gravitational drag exerted by
the background gas. In the later stages, when the binary dominates the
gravitational potential in its vicinity, the medium responds by forming
an ellipsoidal density enhancement whose axis lags behind the binary
axis, and this offset produces a torque on the binary that causes
continuing loss of angular momentum and is able to reduce the binary
separation to distances where gravitational radiation is efficient.
Assuming typical parameters from observations of ultraluminous infrared
galaxies, we predict that a black hole binary will merge within
10^{7} yr; therefore, these results imply that in a merger of
gas-rich galaxies, any massive central black holes will coalesce soon
after the galaxies merge. Our work thus supports scenarios of massive
black hole evolution and growth in which hierarchical merging plays an
important role. The final coalescence of the black holes leads to
gravitational radiation emission that would be detectable out to high
redshift by LISA. We show that similar physical effects, which we
simulate with higher resolution than in previous work, can also be
important for the formation of close binary stars.

The properties of this source are best explained by invoking a black
hole with a mass of at least 350 solar masses (350M_{solar}),
which is intermediate between stellar-mass and supermassive black holes.
A nearby but somewhat more massive cluster (MGG 9) shows no evidence of
such an intermediate-mass black hole, raising the issue of just what
physical characteristics of the clusters can account for this
difference. Here we report numerical simulations of the evolution and
motion of stars within the clusters, where stars are allowed to merge
with each other. We find that for MGG 11 dynamical friction leads to the
massive stars sinking rapidly to the centre of the cluster, where they
participate in a runaway collision. This produces a star of 800-3,000
M_{solar}, which ultimately collapses to a black hole of
intermediate mass. No such runaway occurs in the cluster MGG 9, because
the larger cluster radius leads to a mass segregation timescale a factor
of five longer than for MGG 11.

the mass function of dark matter halos in the {$\Lambda$}CDM ({$\Lambda$} cold

photoionization at high redshift, feedback processes, galaxy merging,
and thermal conduction affect the shape of the luminosity function. We
consider three processes whereby supernovae and stellar wind energy can
affect the forming galaxy: (1) the reheating of cold disk gas to the
halo temperature; (2) expansion of the hot, diffuse halo gas; and (3)
complete expulsion of cold disk gas from the halo. We demonstrate that
while feedback of form 1 is able to flatten the faint end of the galaxy
luminosity function, this process alone does not produce the sharp
cutoff observed at large luminosities. Feedback of form 2 is also unable
to solve the problem at the bright end of the luminosity function. The
relative paucity of very bright galaxies can only be explained if
cooling in massive halos is strongly suppressed. This might happen if
thermal conduction near the centers of halos is very efficient, or if a
substantial amount of gas is expelled from halos by process 3 above.
Conduction is a promising mechanism, but an uncomfortably high
efficiency is required to suppress cooling to the desired level. If,
instead, superwinds are responsible for the lack of bright galaxies,
then the total energy budget required to obtain a good match to the
galaxy luminosity function greatly exceeds the energy available from
supernova explosions. The mechanism is only viable if the formation of
central supermassive black holes and the associated energy generation
play a crucial role in limiting the amount of stars that form in the
host galaxy. The models that best reproduce the galaxy luminosity
function also give reasonable approximations to the Tully-Fisher
relation and the galaxy autocorrelation function.

Chile), as well as new proper-motion data of the nuclear star cluster of
the Milky Way. The surface density distribution of faint (H{\lt}=20,
K_{s}{\lt}=19) stars peaks within 0.2'' of the black hole
candidate Sgr A*. The radial density distribution of this stellar
``cusp'' follows a power law of exponent {$\alpha$}\~{}1.3-1.4. The K-band
luminosity function of the overall nuclear stellar cluster (within
9^{''} of Sgr A*) resembles that of the large-scale Galactic
bulge but shows an excess of stars at K_{s}{\lt}=14. It fits
population synthesis models of an old, metal-rich stellar population
with a contribution from young, early, and late-type stars at the bright
end. In contrast, the cusp within {\lt}=1.5'' of Sgr A* appears to have a
featureless luminosity function, suggesting that old, low-mass,
horizontal-branch/red-clump stars are lacking. Likewise, there appear to
be fewer late-type giants. The innermost cusp also contains a group of
moderately bright, early-type stars that are tightly bound to the black
hole. We interpret these results as evidence that the stellar properties
change significantly from the outer cluster ({\gt}=a few arcseconds) to
the dense innermost region around the black hole. We find that most of
the massive early-type stars at distances of 1''-10'' from Sgr A* are
located in two rotating and geometrically thin disks. These disks are
inclined at large angles and counterrotate with respect to each other.
Their stellar content is essentially the same, indicating that they
formed at the same time. We conclude that of the possible formation
scenarios for these massive stars the most probable one is that 5-8
million years ago two clouds fell into the center, collided, were shock
compressed, and then formed two rotating (accretion) disks orbiting the
central black hole. For the OB stars in the central arcsecond, on the
other hand, a stellar merger model is the most appealing explanation.
These stars may thus be ``super-blue stragglers,'' formed and
``rejuvenated'' through mergers of lower mass stars in the very dense
({\gt}=10^{8} M_{solar} pc^{-3}) environment of
the cusp. The ``collider model'' also accounts for the lack of giants
within the central few arcseconds. The star closest to Sgr A* in 2002,
S2, exhibits a 3.8 {$\mu$}m excess. We propose that the mid-IR emission
comes either from the accretion flow around the black hole itself or
from dust in the accretion flow that is heated by the ultraviolet
emission of S2.

luminous quasars around redshift z\~{}6-suggesting a very early assembly
epoch-and by numerical simulations of the fragmentation of primordial
molecular clouds in cold dark matter (CDM) cosmogonies, we assume that
the first ``seed'' black holes (BHs) had intermediate masses and formed
in (mini)halos collapsing at z\~{}20 from high-{$\sigma$} density
fluctuations. As these pregalactic holes become incorporated through a
series of mergers into larger and larger halos, they sink to the center
because of dynamical friction, accrete a fraction of the gas in the
merger remnant to become supermassive, form a binary system, and
eventually coalesce. The merger history of dark matter halos and
associated BHs is followed by cosmological Monte Carlo realizations of
the merger hierarchy from early times until the present in a {$\Lambda$}CDM
cosmology. A simple model, where quasar activity is driven by major
mergers and SMBHs accrete at the Eddington rate a mass that scales with
the fifth power of the circular velocity of the host halo, is shown to
reproduce the observed luminosity function of optically selected quasars
in the redshift range 1{\lt}z{\lt}5. A scheme for describing the hardening
of a BH binary in a stellar background with core formation due to mass
ejection is applied, where the stellar cusp proportional to
r^{-2} is promptly regenerated after every major merger event,
replenishing the mass displaced by the binary. Triple BH interactions
will inevitably take place at early times if the formation route for the
assembly of SMBHs goes back to the very first generation of stars, and
we follow them in our merger tree. The assumptions underlying our
scenario lead to the prediction of a population of massive BHs wandering

contributing {\lt}\~{}10\% to the total BH mass density,
{$\rho$}_{SMBH}=4{\times}10^{5} M_{solar}

is on the order of 10\% today, and it increases with redshift so that
almost all massive nuclear BHs at early epochs are in binary systems.
The fraction of binary quasars (both members brighter than
0.1L_{*}) instead is less than 0.3\% at all epochs. The nuclear
SMBH occupation fraction is unity (0.6) at the present epoch if the
first seed BHs were as numerous as the 3.5 {$\sigma$} (4 {$\sigma$}) density

 abstract = "{Since many or most galaxies have central massive black holes (BHs),
mergers of galaxies can form massive binary black holes (BBHs). In this
paper we study the evolution of massive BBHs in realistic galaxy models,
using a generalization of techniques used to study tidal disruption
rates around massive BHs. The evolution of BBHs depends on BH mass ratio
and host galaxy type. BBHs with very low mass ratios (say, {\lt}\~{}0.001)
are hardly ever formed by mergers of galaxies, because the dynamical
friction time-scale is too long for the smaller BH to sink into the
galactic centre within a Hubble time. BBHs with moderate mass ratios are
most likely to form and survive in spherical or nearly spherical
galaxies and in high-luminosity or high-dispersion galaxies; they are
most likely to have merged in low-dispersion galaxies (line-of-sight
velocity dispersion {\lt}\~{}90kms^{-1} ) or in highly flattened or
triaxial galaxies. The semimajor axes and orbital periods of surviving
BBHs are generally in the range 10^{-3} -10pc and
10-10^{5} yr they are also larger in high-dispersion galaxies
than in low-dispersion galaxies, larger in nearly spherical galaxies
than in highly flattened or triaxial galaxies, and larger for BBHs with
equal masses than for BBHs with unequal masses. The orbital velocities
of surviving BBHs are generally in the range 10^{2}
-10^{4} kms^{-1} . The methods of detecting surviving
BBHs are also discussed. If no evidence of BBHs is found in AGNs, this
may be either because gas plays a major role in BBH orbital decay or
because nuclear activity switches on soon after a galaxy merger, and
ends before the smaller BH has had time to spiral to the centre of the
galaxy.

galaxy formation models, the most common binaries are likely to arise

the loss of orbital angular momentum to the gaseous disk shrinks the

primary black hole is not increased, and can be substantially reduced,
during this disk-driven migration. At smaller separations, gravitational
radiation becomes the dominant angular momentum loss process, and any
gas trapped inside the orbit of the secondary is driven inward by the
inspiralling black hole. The implied accretion rate just prior to
coalescence exceeds the Eddington limit, so the final merger is likely
to occur within a common envelope formed from the disrupted inner disk

the lack of observations of intermediate-mass BHs (IMBHs), which could

missing link (i.e., an IMBH) has been found in observations made by ASCA

Subsequent observations by Subaru have revealed that this IMBH
apparently coincides with a young compact star cluster. Based on these
findings, we suggest a new formation scenario for SMBHs. In this
scenario, IMBHs first form in young compact star clusters through
runaway merging of massive stars. While these IMBHs are forming, the
host star clusters sink toward the galactic nucleus through dynamical
friction and upon evaporation deposit their IMBHs near the galactic
center. The IMBHs then form binaries and eventually merge via
gravitational radiation, forming an SMBH.

Telescope (HST). This has greatly accelerated the detection rate. As of
2001 March, dynamical BH detections are available for at least 37
galaxies. The demographics of these objects lead to the following
conclusions: (1) BH mass correlates with the luminosity of the bulge
component of the host galaxy, albeit with considerable scatter. The
median BH mass fraction is 0.13\% of the mass of the bulge. (2) BH mass
correlates with the mean velocity dispersion of the bulge inside its
effective radius, i.e., with how strongly the bulge stars are
gravitationally bound to each other. For the best mass determinations,
the scatter is consistent with the measurement errors. (3) BH mass
correlates with the luminosity of the high-density central component in
disk galaxies independent of whether this is a real bulge (a
mini-elliptical, believed to form via a merger-induced dissipative
collapse and starburst) or a ``pseudobulge'' (believed to form by inward
transport of disk material). (4) BH mass does not correlate with the
luminosity of galaxy disks. If pure disks contain BHs (and active nuclei
imply that some do), then their masses are much smaller than 0.13\% of
the mass of the disk. We conclude that present observations show no
dependence of BH mass on the details of whether BH feeding happens
rapidly during a collapse or slowly via secular evolution of the disk.
The above results increasingly support the hypothesis that the major
events that form a bulge or elliptical galaxy and the main growth phases
of its BH-when it shone like a quasar-were the same events. .

by dark matter halos in hierarchical structure formation models, even if
only a small fraction of these galaxies harbor SMBHs at high redshifts.
We illustrate this possibility using cosmological Monte Carlo
simulations of the merger history of dark matter halos and their
associated SMBHs. In our most extreme models, in order to populate
nearly every bright galaxy with an SMBH at z=0, only a few percent of
the halos with virial temperatures above 10^{4} K are required
to harbor an SMBH at high redshift. This possibility must be included in
studies of the luminosity function and the clustering properties of
quasars. We predict the number of SMBH merger events that are detectable
by the gravitational wave experiment Laser Interferometer Space Antenna
(LISA), as a function of redshift, out to z=5. Although the event rates
can be significantly reduced in scenarios with rare SMBHs, a minimum of
\~{}10 detectable merger events per year is predicted if SMBH binaries
coalesce efficiently. The observed distribution of events with redshift
could yield valuable information on the SMBH formation process. If SMBH
binaries do not coalesce, we find that at least several SMBH slingshot
ejections probably occurred from z=5 to the present in each galaxy more
massive than \~{}10^{11} M_{solar} at z=0. Although our
results are sensitive to the minimum cooling mass assumed for the

in high-{$\sigma$} rare density peaks, relic MBHs are predicted to cluster

The presence of a small cluster of MBHs in galaxy nuclei may have
several interesting consequences associated with it, such as tidal
captures of ordinary stars (likely followed by disruption), MBH capture
by the central supermassive black hole, and gravitational wave radiation
from such coalescences. Accreting pregalactic MBHs may be detectable as
ultraluminous, off-nuclear X-ray sources.

mergers between galaxies move black holes along the observed

coalesce and a few per cent of the gas in the merger remnant is accreted

With these simple assumptions, our model not only fits many aspects of

the observed relation between bulge luminosity and black hole mass in

density of quasars from z\~{}2 to z=0 is a result of the combination of
three effects: (i) a decrease in the merging rate; (ii) a decrease in
the amount of cold gas available to fuel black holes, and (iii) an
increase in the time-scale for gas accretion. The predicted decline in
the total content of cold gas in galaxies is consistent with that

superelastic encounters with other cluster members and are ultimately

gravity-wave detection rates substantially greater than the
corresponding rates from neutron star mergers. For the first-generation
Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO-I), we expect

gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is now supported by redshift measurements for a
half-dozen faint host galaxies. Still, the nature of the central engine
(or engines) that provide the burst energy remains unclear. While many
models have been proposed, those currently favored are all based upon
the formation of and/or rapid accretion into stellar-mass black holes.
Here we discuss a variety of such scenarios and estimate the probability
of each. Population synthesis calculations are carried out using a Monte
Carlo approach in which the many uncertain parameters intrinsic to such
calculations are varied. We estimate the event rate for each class of
model as well as the propagation distances for those having significant
delay between formation and burst production, i.e., double neutron star
(DNS) mergers and black hole-neutron star (BH/NS) mergers. One
conclusion is a 1-2 order of magnitude decrease in the rate of DNS and
BH/NS mergers compared to that previously calculated using invalid
assumptions about common envelope evolution. Other major uncertainties
in the event rates and propagation distances include the history of star
formation in the universe, the masses of the galaxies in which merging
compact objects are born, and the radii of the hydrogen-stripped cores
of massive stars. For reasonable assumptions regarding each, we
calculate a daily event rate in the universe for (1) merging neutron
stars: \~{}100 day^{-1} (2) neutron star-black hole mergers: \~{}450
day^{-1} (3) collapsars: \~{}10^{4} day^{-1} (4)
helium star black hole mergers: \~{}1000 day^{-1} and (5) white
dwarf-black hole mergers: \~{}20 day^{-1}. The range of uncertainty
in these numbers, however, is very large, typically 2-3 orders of
magnitude. These rates must additionally be multiplied by any relevant
beaming factor (f_{Ω}{\lt}1) and sampling fraction (if the
entire universal set of models is not being observed). Depending upon
the mass of the host galaxy, one-half of the DNS mergers will happen
within 60 kpc (for a galaxy with a mass comparable to that of the Milky
Way) to 5 Mpc (for a galaxy with negligible mass) from the Galactic
center. The same numbers characterize BH/NS mergers. Because of the
delay time, neutron star and black hole mergers will happen at a
redshift 0.5-0.8 times that of the other classes of models. Information
is still lacking regarding the hosts of short, hard bursts, but we
suggest that they are due to DNS and BH/NS mergers and thus will
ultimately be determined to lie outside of galaxies and at a closer mean
distance than long complex bursts (which we attribute to collapsars). In
the absence of a galactic site, the distance to these bursts may be
difficult to determine.

continued evolution of rotating helium stars, M\_{$\alpha$}{\gt}\~{}10 M\_solar,
in which iron-core collapse does not produce a successful outgoing shock
but instead forms a black hole of 2-3 M\_solar. The model explored in
greatest detail is the 14 M\_solar helium core of a 35 M\_solar
main-sequence star. The outcome is sensitive to the angular momentum.
For j\_16=j/(10\^{}16 cm\^{}2 s\^{}-1){\lt}\~{}3, material falls into the black hole
almost uninhibited. No outflows are expected. For j\_16{\gt}\~{}20, the
infalling matter is halted by centrifugal force outside 1000 km where
neutrino losses are negligible. The equatorial accretion rate is very
low, and explosive oxygen burning may power a weak equatorial explosion.
For 3{\lt}\~{}j\_16{\lt}\~{}20, however, a reasonable value for such stars, a
compact disk forms at a radius at which the gravitational binding energy
can be efficiently radiated as neutrinos or converted to beamed outflow
by magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) processes. These are the best candidates
for producing gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Here we study the formation of
such a disk, the associated flow patterns, and the accretion rate for
disk viscosity parameter {$\alpha$}\~{}0.001 and 0.1. Infall along the
rotational axis is initially uninhibited, and an evacuated channel opens
during the first few seconds. Meanwhile the black hole is spun up by the
accretion (to a\~{}0.9), and energy is dissipated in the disk by MHD
processes and radiated by neutrinos. For the {$\alpha$}=0.1 model,
appreciable energetic outflows develop between polar angles of 30 deg
and 45 deg. These outflows, powered by viscous dissipation in the disk,
have an energy of up to a few times 10\^{}51 ergs and a mass \~{}1 M\_solar and
are rich in \^{}56Ni. They constitute a supernova-like explosion by
themselves. Meanwhile accretion through the disk is maintained for
approximately 10-20 s but is time variable (+/-30\%) because of
hydrodynamical instabilities at the outer edge in a region where nuclei
are experiencing photodisintegration. Because the efficiency of neutrino
energy deposition is sensitive to the accretion rate, this instability
leads to highly variable energy deposition in the polar regions. Some of
this variability, which has significant power at 50 ms and overtones,
may persist in the time structure of the burst. During the time
followed, the average accretion rate for the standard {$\alpha$}=0.1 and
j\_16=10 model is 0.07 M\_solar s\^{}-1. The total energy deposited along the
rotational axes by neutrino annihilation is (1-14)x10\^{}51 ergs, depending
upon the evolution of the Kerr parameter and uncertain neutrino
efficiencies. Simulated deposition of energy in the polar regions, at a
constant rate of 5x10\^{}50 ergs s\^{}-1 per pole, results in strong
relativistic outflow jets beamed to about 1\% of the sky. These jets may
be additionally modulated by instabilities in the sides of the
``nozzle'' through which they flow. The jets blow aside the accreting
material, remain highly focused, and are capable of penetrating the star
in \~{}10 s. After the jet breaks through the surface of the star, highly
relativistic flow can emerge. Because of the sensitivity of the mass
ejection and jets to accretion rate, angular momentum, and disk
viscosity, and the variation of observational consequences with viewing
angle, a large range of outcomes is possible, ranging from bright GRBs
like GRB 971214 to faint GRB-supernovae like SN 1998bw. X-ray precursors
are also possible as the jet first breaks out of the star. While only a
small fraction of supernovae make GRBs, we predict that collapsars will
always make supernovae similar to SN 1998bw. However, hard, energetic
GRBs shorter than a few seconds will be difficult to produce in this
model and may require merging neutron stars and black holes for their
explanation.

 abstract = "{By means of three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations with a Eulerian
PPM code we investigate the formation and the properties of the
accretion torus around the stellar mass black hole which we assume to
originate from the remnant of a neutron star merger within the dynamical
time scale of a few milliseconds. The simulations are performed with
four nested cartesian grids which allow for both a good resolution near
the central black hole and a large computational volume. They include
the use of a physical equation of state as well as the neutrino emission
from the hot matter of the torus. The gravity of the black hole is
described with a Newtonian and alternatively with a
Paczy{\'n}ski-Wiita potential. In a post-processing step, we evaluate
our models for the energy deposition by nu bar nu annihilation around
the accretion torus. We find that the torus formed after neutron star
merging has a mass between several 10(-2$\}$ M\_$\{$sun) and a few 10(-1$\}$
M\_$\{$sun) with maximum densities around 10(12) g cm(-3) and maximum
temperatures of about 10 MeV (entropies around 5 k\_B per nucleon).
Correspondingly, the neutrino emission is huge with a total luminosity
near 10(53) erg s(-1) . Neutrino-antineutrino annihilation deposits
energy in the vicinity of the torus at a rate of (3-5)x 10(50) erg s(-1)
. It is most efficient near the rotation axis where 10 to 30\% of this
energy or up to a total of 10(49) erg are dumped within an estimated
emission period of 0.02-0.1 s in a region with a low integral baryonic
mass of about 10(-5$\}$ M\_$\{$sun) . This baryon pollution is still
dangerously high, and the estimated maximum relativistic Lorentz factors
Gamma -1 are around unity. The conversion of neutrino energy into a pair
plasma, however, is sufficiently powerful to blow out the baryons along
the axis so that a clean funnel should be produced within only
milliseconds. Our models show that accretion on the black hole formed
after neutron star merging can yield enough energy by nu bar nu
annihilation to account for weak, short gamma-ray bursts, if moderate
beaming is involved. In fact, the barrier of the dense baryonic gas of
the torus suggests that the low-density e(+/-gamma ) plasma is beamed as
axial jets into a fraction f\_{$\Omega$} = 2delta Omega /(4pi ) between
1/100 and 1/10 of the sky, corresponding to opening half-angles of
roughly ten to several tens of degrees. Thus gamma -burst energies of
E\_{$\gamma$}\~{} E\_$\{$nu bar nu $\}$/f\_{$\Omega$}{\lt}\~{} 10(50) -10(51) erg seem to be
within the reach of accreting black holes formed in neutron star mergers
(if the source is interpreted as radiating isotropically), corresponding
to luminosities around 10(51) erg s(-1) for typical burst durations of
0.1-1 s. Gravitational capture of radiation by the black hole, redshift
and ray bending do not reduce the jet energy significantly, because most
of the neutrino emission comes from parts of the torus at distances of
several Schwarzschild radii from the black hole. Effects associated with
the Kerr character of the rapidly rotating black hole, however, could
increase the gamma -burst energy considerably, and effects due to
magnetic fields might even be required to get the energies for long
complex gamma-ray bursts.

of 15 ultraluminous IRAS galaxies (LIR {\gt}= 1012 L{\.o}). We combine
the survey results with a detailed case study, based on arcsecond
resolution, near-IR, and millimeter imaging spectroscopy, of one of the
sample galaxies (UGC 5101). We compare the near- and mid-IR
characteristics of these ultraluminous galaxies to ISO and literature
data of 30 starburst and active galactic nuclei (AGN) template galaxies.
We find the following: 1. Of the ultraluminous IRAS galaxies in our
sample, 70\%-80\% are predominantly powered by recently formed massive
stars, and 20\%-30\% are powered by a central AGN. These conclusions are
based on a new infrared ''diagnostic diagram'' involving the ratio of
high- to low-excitation mid-IR emission lines on the one hand, and the
strength of the 7.7 mu m PAH feature on the other hand. 2. At least half
of the sources probably have simultaneously an active nucleus and
starburst activity in a 1-2 kpc diameter circumnuclear disk/ring. 3. The
mid-IR emitting regions are highly obscured [Av(screen) \~{} 5-50 or
Av(mixed) \~{} 50-1000]. In a model where star-forming regions and dense
molecular clouds are fully mixed, the ISO-derived, V-band dust
extinctions approach the dust column densities inferred from CO
millimeter measurements. After correction for these extinctions, we
estimate that the star-forming regions in ultraluminous infrared
galaxies have ages between 107 and 108 yr, similar to but somewhat
larger than those found in lower luminosity starburst galaxies. 4. In
the sample we have studied there is no obvious trend for the AGN
component to dominate in the most compact, and thus most advanced
mergers. Instead, at any given time during the merger evolution, the
time-dependent compression of the circumnuclear interstellar gas, the
accretion rate onto the central black hole, and the associated radiation
efficiency may determine whether star formation or AGN activity
dominates the luminosity of the system.

neutron star binaries (heretofore regarded as the ``bread and butter''
workhorse source for LIGO-VIRGO, visible to about 30 Mpc by initial

LIGO interferometers, 100M_{solar} for advanced,
10^{6}M_{solar} for LISA) are best searched for via
their well-understood inspiral waves; higher mass BBHs must be searched
for via their poorly understood merger waves and/or their

those found from inspiral and ringdown waves, without detailed knowledge
of the waveform shapes, using a noise monitoring search algorithm which
we describe. A full set of merger templates from numerical relativity

afterglows, then the popular model in which GRBs are caused by merging
neutron stars will have to be abandoned, and a model linking GRBs to
cataclysmic deaths of massive stars will be favored. The presence of
X-ray precursors, first detected with Ginga, is easier to understand
within a framework of a ''dirty'' rather than a ''clean'' fireball. A very
energetic explosion of a massive star is likely to create a dirty
fireball rather than a clean one. A specific speculative example of such
an explosion is proposed: a microquasar. Its geometrical structure is
similar to the ''failed supernova'' of Woosley: the inner core of a

hole with \~{} 5x10^{54} ergs of rotational energy, while the outer

that the merger time is not sensitive to the eccentricity growth unless
a binary forms with at least a moderate eccentricity. We find here that
the eccentricity can become large under some conditions if a binary
forms in a galaxy with a flat core or with a radial bias in its velocity
distribution, especially if the dynamical friction is enhanced by
resonances as suggested by Rauch {\amp} Tremaine (1996). But the
necessary conditions seem unlikely, and our prediction from paper I
remains unchanged: in most cases the eccentricity will start and remain
small. The ejection of stars caused by the hardening of a binary may
explain why large elliptical galaxies have weaker density cusps than
smaller galaxies. If so, the central velocity distributions in those
galaxies should have strong tangential anisotropies. The wandering of a
binary from the center of a galaxy counteracts the effects of loss-cone
depletion and helps the binary merge.

profiles are parameterized by break radius r_{βand} break
surface brightness 1_{β} These are combined with central
velocity dispersions, total luminosities, rotation velocities, and
isophote shapes to explore correlations among central and global
properties. Luminous hot galaxies (M_{v}{\lt}-22) have cuspy
cores with steep outer power-law profiles that break at
r{\asymp}r_{β} to shallow inner profiles
I{\prop}r^{-γ} with {$\gamma$}{\le}0.3. Break radii and core
luminosities for these objects are approximately proportional to
effective radii and total luminosities. Scaling relations are
presented for several core parameters as a function of total
luminosity. Cores follow a fundamental plane that parallels the global
fundamental plane for hot galaxies but is 30\% thicker. Some of this
extra thickness may be due to the effect of massive black holes (BHs)
on central velocity dispersions. Faint hot galaxies
(M_{v}{\gt}-20.5) show steep, largely featureless power-law
profiles that lack cores. Measured values of rb and b for these
galaxies are limits only. At a limiting radius of 10 pc, the centers
of power-law galaxies are up to 1000 times denser in mass and
luminosity than the cores of large galaxies. At intermediate
magnitudes (-22{\lt}M_{v}{\lt}-20.5), core and power-law
galaxies coexist, and there is a range in r_{β} at a
given luminosity of at least two orders of magnitude.  Here, central
properties correlate strongly with global rotation and shape: core
galaxies tend to be boxy and slowly rotating, whereas power-law
galaxies tend to be disky and rapidly rotating. A search for inner
disks was conducted to test a claim in the literature, based on a
smaller sample, that power laws originate from edge-on stellar
disks. We find only limited evidence for such disks and believe that
the difference between core and power-law profiles reflects a real
difference in the spatial distribution of the luminous spheroidal
component of the galaxy. The dense power-law centers of disky,
rotating galaxies are consistent with their formation in gas-rich
mergers. The parallel proposition, that cores are the by-products of
gas-free stellar mergers, is less compelling for at least two reasons:
(1) dissipationless hierarchical clustering does not appear to produce
core profiles like those seen; (2) core galaxies accrete small, dense,
gas-free galaxies at a rate sufficient to fill in their low-density
cores if the satellites survived and sank to the center (whether the
satellites survive is still an open question). An alternative model
for core formation involves the orbital decay of massive BHs that are
accreted in mergers: the decaying BHs may heat and eject stars from
the center, eroding a power law if any exists and scouring out a
core. An average BH mass per spheroid of 0.002 times the stellar mass
yields cores in fair agreement with observed cores and is consistent
with the energetics of AGNs and the kinematic detection of BHs in
nearby galaxies. An unresolved issue is why power-law galaxies also do
not have cores if this process operates in all hot galaxies.

for luminous IRAS galaxies and may contribute significantly to the
central stellar populations of merger remnants. If some of the nuclear
gas can continue to lose angular momentum, it may be able to fuel or

neglected, such as in black holes or in the very early universe.
Strategies for resolving the Problem of Time have evolved somewhat since
Kuchar and Isham's well-known reviews from the early 90's. These come in
the following divisions I) time before quantization, such as hidden time
or matter time. II) Time after quantization, such as emergent
semiclassical time. III) Timeless strategies of Type 1: naive
Schrodinger interpretation, conditional probabilities interpretation and
various forms of records theories, and Type 2 `Rovelli': in terms of
evolving constants of the motion, complete observables and partial
observables. IV) I argue for histories theories to be a separate class
of strategy. Additionally, various combinations of these strategies have
begun to appear in the literature; I discuss a number of such. Finally,
I comment on loop quantum gravity, supergravity and string/M-theory from
the problem of time perspective.

fluctuations can be used to estimate the Knudsen number of the system

this quantitatively, we apply the UrQMD model, with scaled cross
sections, to show that collisions at RHIC have a Knudsen number at least
one order of magnitude below the expected value for an interacting
hadron gas. Furthermore, we argue that the Knudsen number is also bound
from below by the v_{2} fluctuation data, because too small a
Knudsen number would break the observed scaling of v_{2}
fluctuations due to the onset of turbulent flow. We propose, therefore
that v_{2} fluctuation measurements, together with an
understanding of the turbulent regime for relativistic hydrodynamics,
will provide an upper as well as a lower limit for the Knudsen number.
We also argue that an energy scan of v_{2} fluctuations could
shed light on the onset of the fluid regime.

derived from a sample of luminous red galaxies (LRGs) from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Seventh Data Release (DR7). The halo power
spectrum has a direct connection to the underlying dark matter power for
k {\lt}= 0.2hMpc^{-1}, well into the quasi-linear regime. This
enables us to use a factor of \~{}8 more modes in the cosmological analysis
than an analysis with k_{max} = 0.1hMpc^{-1}, as was
adopted in the SDSS team analysis of the DR4 LRG sample. The observed
halo power spectrum for 0.02 {\lt} k {\lt} 0.2hMpc^{-1} is well
fitted by our model: {$\chi$}^{2} = 39.6 for 40 degrees of freedom
for the best-fitting {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter ({$\Lambda$}CDM) model. We
find {$\Omega$}_{m}h^{2}(n_{s}/0.96)^{1.2}
= 0.141^{+0.010}_{-0.012} for a power-law primordial
power spectrum with spectral index n_{s} and
{$\Omega$}_{b}h^{2} = 0.02265 fixed, consistent with cosmic
microwave background measurements. The halo power spectrum also
constrains the ratio of the comoving sound horizon at the baryon-drag
epoch to an effective distance to z = 0.35:
r_{s}/D_{V}(0.35) =
0.1097^{+0.0039}_{-0.0042}. Combining the halo power
spectrum measurement with the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe
(WMAP) 5 year results, for the flat {$\Lambda$}CDM model we find
{$\Omega$}_{m} = 0.289 +/- 0.019 and H_{0} = 69.4 +/-
1.6kms^{-1}Mpc^{-1}. Allowing for massive neutrinos in
{$\Lambda$}CDM, we find eV at the 95 per cent confidence level. If we
instead consider the effective number of relativistic species
N_{eff} as a free parameter, we find N_{eff} =
4.8^{+1.8}_{-1.7}. Combining also with the Kowalski et
al. supernova sample, we find {$\Omega$}_{tot} = 1.011 +/- 0.009

estimate the phase and amplitude errors in the numerical waveforms and
then minimize the difference between numerical and EOB waveforms by
calibrating a handful of EOB-adjustable parameters. In the equal-mass,
spin aligned case, we find that phase and fractional amplitude
differences between the numerical and EOB (2,2) mode can be reduced to
0.01 radian and 1\%, respectively, over the entire inspiral waveforms. In
the equal-mass, spin antialigned case, these differences can be reduced
to 0.13 radian and 1\% during inspiral and plunge, and to 0.4 radian and
10\% during merger and ringdown. The waveform agreement is within
numerical errors in the spin aligned case while slightly over numerical
errors in the spin antialigned case. Using Enhanced LIGO and Advanced
LIGO noise curves, we find that the overlap between the EOB and the
numerical (2,2) mode, maximized over the initial phase and time of
arrival, is larger than 0.999 for binaries with total mass
30M_{ȯ}-200M_{ȯ}. In addition to the
leading (2,2) mode, we compare four subleading modes. We find good
amplitude and frequency agreements between the EOB and numerical modes
for both spin configurations considered, except for the (3,2) mode in
the spin antialigned case. We believe that the larger difference in the
(3,2) mode is due to the lack of knowledge of post-Newtonian spin

recently proposed potentially ultraviolet-complete quantum theory of

isotropic space-time. Starting from the most general metric, we work out
the complete second order action for the perturbations. We then make use
of the residual gauge invariance and of the constraint equations to
reduce the number of dynamical degrees of freedom. At first glance, it
appears that there is an extra scalar metric degree of freedom. However,
introducing the Sasaki-Mukhanov variable, the combination of spatial
metric fluctuation and matter inhomogeneity for which the action in
general relativity has canonical form, we find that this variable has
the standard time derivative term in the second order action, and that
the extra degree of freedom is nondynamical. The limit {$\lambda$}{\rarr}1
is well behaved, unlike what is obtained when expanding about Minkowski
space-time. Thus, there is no strong coupling problem for
Ho{\v r}ava-Lifshitz gravity when considering cosmological solutions.
We also compute the spectrum of cosmological perturbations. If the
potential in the action is taken to be of {\ldquo}detailed balance{\rdquo}
form, we find a cancellation of the highest derivative terms in the
action for the curvature fluctuations. As a consequence, the initial
spectrum of perturbations will not be scale-invariant in a general
space-time background, in contrast to what happens when considering
Ho{\v r}ava-Lifshitz matter leaving the gravitational sector
unperturbed. However, if we break the detailed balance condition, then
the initial spectrum of curvature fluctuations is indeed scale-invariant
on ultraviolet scales. As an application, we consider fluctuations in an
inflationary background and draw connections with the
{\ldquo}trans-Planckian problem{\rdquo} for cosmological perturbations. In
the special case in which the potential term in the action is of
detailed balance form and in which {$\lambda$}=1, the equation of motion
for cosmological perturbations in the far UV takes the same form as in
general relativity. However, in general the equation of motion is
characterized by a modified dispersion relation.

fundamental determinations of stellar masses and radii. We have
identified 95 detached binary systems containing 190 stars (94 eclipsing
systems, and {$\alpha$} Centauri) that satisfy our criterion that the mass
and radius of both stars be known within errors of {\plusmn}3\% accuracy
or better. All of them are non-interacting systems, and so the stars
should have evolved as if they were single. This sample more than
doubles that of the earlier similar review by Andersen (Astron Astrophys
Rev 3:91-126, 1991), extends the mass range at both ends and, for
the first time, includes an extragalactic binary. In every case, we have
examined the original data and recomputed the stellar parameters with a
consistent set of assumptions and physical constants. To these we add
interstellar reddening, effective temperature, metal abundance,
rotational velocity and apsidal motion determinations when available,
and we compute a number of other physical parameters, notably luminosity
and distance. These accurate physical parameters reveal the effects of
stellar evolution with unprecedented clarity, and we discuss the use of
the data in observational tests of stellar evolution models in some
detail. Earlier findings of significant structural differences between
moderately fast-rotating, mildly active stars and single stars, ascribed
to the presence of strong magnetic and spot activity, are confirmed
beyond doubt. We also show how the best data can be used to test
prescriptions for the subtle interplay between convection, diffusion,
and other non-classical effects in stellar models. The amount and
quality of the data also allow us to analyse the tidal evolution of the
systems in considerable depth, testing prescriptions of rotational
synchronisation and orbital circularisation in greater detail than
possible before. We show that the formulae for pseudo-synchronisation of
stars in eccentric orbits predict the observed rotations quite well,
except for very young and/or widely separated stars. Deviations do
occur, however, especially for stars with convective envelopes. The
superior data set finally demonstrates that apsidal motion rates as
predicted from General Relativity plus tidal theory are in good
agreement with the best observational data. No reliable binary data
exist, which challenge General Relativity to any significant extent. The
new data also enable us to derive empirical calibrations of M and R for
single (post-) main-sequence stars above $\{$0.6 M\_$\{$odot$\}$$\}$. Simple,
polynomial functions of T _{eff}, log g and [Fe/H] yield M and R
within errors of 6 and 3\%, respectively. Excellent agreement is found
with independent determinations for host stars of transiting extrasolar
planets, and good agreement with determinations of M and R from stellar
models as constrained by trigonometric parallaxes and spectroscopic
values of T _{eff} and [Fe/H]. Finally, we list a set of 23
interferometric binaries with masses known to be better than 3\%, but
without fundamental radius determinations (except {$\alpha$} Aur). We
discuss the prospects for improving these and other stellar parameters
in the near future.

improvement allows us to place tighter constraints on the matter density

temperature-polarization (TE) spectrum is detected in the 7-year data

reionization, is detected at 5.5 sigma significance when averaged over l

inflation, remains consistent with zero. The upper limit on tensor modes
from polarization data alone is a factor of 2 lower with the 7-year data

presented. The data included in this article were collected during the

approximately an order of magnitude increase in the number of analyzed

distributions of {$\pi$}^{0} mesons detected in the PHENIX
electromagnetic calorimeters are measured relative to the reaction plane
determined event-by-event using the forward and backward beam-beam

the angular distributions are presented as a function of
{$\pi$}^{0} transverse momentum (p_{T}) for different bins
in collision centrality. Measured reaction plane dependent
{$\pi$}^{0} yields are used to determine the azimuthal dependence
of the {$\pi$}^{0} suppression as a function of p_{T},
R_{AA}({$\Delta$}{\phiv},p_{T}). A jet-quenching motivated
geometric analysis is presented that attempts to simultaneously describe
the centrality dependence and reaction plane angle dependence of the
{$\pi$}^{0} suppression in terms of the path lengths of
hypothetical parent partons in the medium. This set of results allows
for a detailed examination of the influence of geometry in the collision
region and of the interplay between collective flow and jet-quenching
effects along the azimuthal axis.

followed by an intense theoretical and experimental response in physics

how gravity works are violated on cosmological distance scales. A simple
fix is to introduce a cosmological constant into the field equations for
general relativity. However, the extremely small value of the
cosmological constant, relative to theoretical expectations, has led
theorists to explore numerous alternative explanations that involve the
introduction of an exotic negative-pressure fluid or a modification of
general relativity. Here we review the evidence for cosmic acceleration.
We then survey some of the theoretical attempts to account for it,
including the cosmological constant, quintessence and its variants,
mass-varying neutrinos, and modifications of general relativity. We
discuss experimental and observational tests that may allow us to
distinguish among some of the theoretical ideas that have been proposed.

qualitative signatures of the chiral magnetic effect using quenched

indeed enhanced in the direction of the magnetic field both in
equilibrium configurations of the quantum gluon fields and in a smooth
gluon background with nonzero topological charge. In the confinement
phase the magnetic field enhances the local fluctuations of both the

the effects of the magnetic field become smaller, possibly due to
thermal screening. Using a simple model of a fireball we obtain a good

demonstrate that special conformal symmetries of the parent relativistic

Applying our scaling limit to holographically induced fluid dynamics, we
find gravity dual descriptions of an arbitrary solution of the forced

solution to the Navier-Stokes equations, and demonstrate that this

investigated in some detail. These have primarily been in the context of
the Schrodinger symmetry group. Here we initiate a study based on a
different non-relativistic conformal symmetry: one obtained by a
parametric contraction of the relativistic conformal group. The
resulting Galilean conformal symmetry has the same number of generators
as the relativistic symmetry group and thus is different from the
Schrodinger group (which has fewer). One of the interesting features of
the Galilean Conformal Algebra is that it admits an extension to an
infinite dimensional symmetry algebra (which can potentially be
dynamically realised). The latter contains a Virasoro-Kac-Moody
subalgebra. We comment on realisations of this extended symmetry in a
boundary field theory. We also propose a somewhat unusual geometric
structure for the bulk gravity dual to any realisation of this symmetry.
This involves taking a Newton-Cartan like limit of Einstein's equations
in anti de Sitter space which singles out an AdS_{2} comprising
of the time and radial direction. The infinite dimensional Virasoro
extension is identified with the asymptotic isometries of this
AdS_{2}.

 abstract = "{We calibrate the effective-one-body (EOB) model to an accurate numerical
simulation of an equal-mass, nonspinning binary black-hole coalescence
produced by the Caltech-Cornell Collaboration. Aligning the EOB and
numerical waveforms at low frequency over a time interval of
{\tilde}1000M, and taking into account the uncertainties in the numerical
simulation, we investigate the significance and degeneracy of the
EOB-adjustable parameters during inspiral, plunge, and merger, and
determine the minimum number of EOB-adjustable parameters that achieves
phase and amplitude agreements on the order of the numerical error. We
find that phase and fractional amplitude differences between the
numerical and EOB values of the dominant gravitational-wave mode
h_{22} can be reduced to 0.02 radians and 2\%, respectively,
until a time 20M before merger, and to 0.04 radians and 7\%,
respectively, at a time 20M after merger (during ringdown). Using LIGO,
Enhanced LIGO, and Advanced LIGO noise curves, we find that the overlap
between the EOB and the numerical h_{22}, maximized only over
the initial phase and time of arrival, is larger than 0.999 for
equal-mass binary black holes with total mass
30-150M_{ȯ}. In addition to the leading gravitational
mode (2, 2), we compare the dominant subleading modes (4, 4) and (3, 2)
for the inspiral and find phase and amplitude differences on the order
of the numerical error. We also determine the mass-ratio dependence of
one of the EOB-adjustable parameters by calibrating to numerical
inspiral waveforms for black-hole binaries with mass ratios 2{\ratio}1
and 3{\ratio}1. The results presented in this paper improve and extend
recent successful attempts aimed at providing gravitational-wave data
analysts the best analytical EOB model capable of interpolating accurate
numerical simulations.

gravitational-wave modes ({\ell},m) contain harmonics originating from
combinations of the orbital frequency and precession frequencies. We
find that the gravitational radiation from binary systems with large
mass asymmetry and large inclination angle can be distributed among
several modes. For example, during the last stages of inspiral, for some
maximally spinning configurations, the amplitude of the (2, 0) and (2,
1) modes can be comparable to the amplitude of the (2, 2) mode. If the
mass ratio is not too extreme, the {\ell}=3 and {\ell}=4 modes are
generally 1 or 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the {\ell}=2 modes.
Restricting ourselves to spinning, nonprecessing compact binaries, we
apply the stationary-phase approximation and derive the frequency-domain
gravitational waveforms including spin-orbit and spin(1)-spin(2) effects
through 1.5PN and 2PN order, respectively, in amplitude, and 2.5PN order
in phase. Since spin effects in the amplitude through 2PN order affect
only the first and second harmonics of the orbital phase, they do not
extend the mass reach of gravitational-wave detectors. However, they can
interfere with other harmonics and lower or raise the signal-to-noise
ratio depending on the spin orientation. These ready-to-use waveforms
could be employed in the data analysis of the spinning, inspiraling

five-year maps incorporate several improvements in data processing made
possible by the additional years of data and by a more complete analysis
of the instrument calibration and in-flight beam response. We present
several new tests for systematic errors in the polarization data and
conclude that W-band polarization data is not yet suitable for
cosmological studies, but we suggest directions for further study. We do
find that Ka-band data is suitable for use; in conjunction with the
additional years of data, the addition of Ka band to the previously used
Q- and V-band channels significantly reduces the uncertainty in the

Recipes in C [1], ROOT [2] Nature of problem: Statistical-thermal model
analyses of heavy-ion collision data require the calculation of both
primordial particle densities and contributions from resonance decay. A
set of thermal parameters (the number depending on the particular model
imposed) and a set of thermalized particles, with their decays
specified, is required as input to these models. The output is then a
complete set of primordial thermal quantities for each particle,
together with the contributions to the final particle yields from
resonance decay. In many applications of statistical-thermal models it
is required to fit experimental particle multiplicities or particle
ratios. In such analyses, the input is a set of experimental yields and
ratios, a set of particles comprising the assumed hadron resonance gas
formed in the collision and the constraints to be placed on the system.
The thermal model parameters consistent with the specified constraints
leading to the best-fit to the experimental data are then output.
Solution method: THERMUS is a package designed for incorporation into
the ROOT [2] framework, used extensively by the heavy-ion community. As
such, it utilizes a great deal of ROOT's functionality in its operation.
ROOT features used in THERMUS include its containers, the wrapper
TMinuit implementing the MINUIT fitting package, and the TMath class of
mathematical functions and routines. Arguably the most useful feature is
the utilization of CINT as the control language, which allows
interactive access to the THERMUS objects. Three distinct statistical
ensembles are included in THERMUS, while additional options to include
quantum statistics, resonance width and excluded volume corrections are
also available. THERMUS provides a default particle list including all
mesons (up to the K4{\lowast} (2045)) and baryons (up to the
{$\Omega$}^{}) listed in the July 2002 Particle Physics Booklet
[3]. For each typically unstable particle in this list, THERMUS includes
a text-file listing its decays. With thermal parameters specified,
THERMUS calculates primordial thermal densities either by performing
numerical integrations or else, in the case of the Boltzmann
approximation without resonance width in the grand-canonical ensemble,
by evaluating Bessel functions. Particle decay chains are then used to
evaluate experimental observables (i.e. particle yields following
resonance decay). Additional detector efficiency factors allow
fine-tuning of the model predictions to a specific detector arrangement.
When parameters are required to be constrained, use is made of the
{\lsquo}Numerical Recipes in C{\rsquo} [1] function which applies the
Broyden globally convergent secant method of solving nonlinear systems
of equations. Since the NRC software is not freely-available, it has to
be purchased by the user. THERMUS provides the means of imposing a large
number of constraints on the chosen model (amongst others, THERMUS can
fix the baryon-to-charge ratio of the system, the strangeness density of
the system and the primordial energy per hadron). Fits to experimental
data are accomplished in THERMUS by using the ROOT TMinuit class. In its
default operation, the standard {$\chi$}^{} function is minimized,
yielding the set of best-fit thermal parameters. THERMUS allows the
assignment of separate decay chains to each experimental input. In this
way, the model is able to match the specific feed-down corrections of a
particular data set. Running time: Depending on the analysis required,
run-times vary from seconds (for the evaluation of particle
multiplicities given a set of parameters) to several minutes (for fits
to experimental data subject to constraints). References:W.H. Press,

simulation of an equal-mass, nonspinning black-hole binary. We also
estimate the (derivative of the) center-of-mass energy from the
simulation by assuming energy balance. We compare these quantities with
the predictions of various PN approximants [adiabatic Taylor and
Pad{\'e} models; nonadiabatic effective-one-body (EOB) models]. We
find that Pad{\'e} summation of the energy flux does not accelerate
the convergence of the flux series; nevertheless, the Pad{\'e} flux
is markedly closer to the numerical result for the whole range of the
simulation (about 30 GW cycles). Taylor and Pad{\'e} models
overestimate the increase in flux and frequency derivative close to
merger, whereas EOB models reproduce more faithfully the shape of and
are closer to the numerical flux, frequency derivative, and derivative
of energy. We also compare the GW phase of the numerical simulation with
Pad{\'e} and EOB models. Matching numerical and untuned 3.5 PN order
waveforms, we find that the phase difference accumulated until
M{$\omega$}=0.1 is -0.12 radians for Pad{\'e} approximants, and 0.50
(0.45) radians for an EOB approximant with Keplerian (non-Keplerian)
flux. We fit free parameters within the EOB models to minimize the phase
difference, and confirm the presence of degeneracies among these
parameters. By tuning the pseudo 4PN order coefficients in the radial
potential or in the flux, or, if present, the location of the pole in
the flux, we find that the accumulated phase difference at M{$\omega$}=0.1
can be reduced{\mdash}if desired{\mdash}to much less than the estimated
numerical phase error (0.02 radians).

require suitable initial data. In this paper, we examine three methods
of constructing binary-black-hole initial data, focusing on their
ability to generate black holes with nearly extremal spins: (i)
Bowen-York initial data, including standard puncture data (based on
conformal flatness and Bowen-York extrinsic curvature), (ii) standard
quasiequilibrium initial data (based on the
extended-conformal-thin-sandwich equations, conformal flatness, and
maximal slicing), and (iii) quasiequilibrium data based on the
superposition of Kerr-Schild metrics. We find that the two conformally
flat methods (i) and (ii) perform similarly, with spins up to about 0.99
obtainable at the initial time. However, in an evolution, we expect the
spin to quickly relax to a significantly smaller value around 0.93 as
the initial geometry relaxes. For quasiequilibrium superposed
Kerr-Schild data [method (iii)], we construct initial data with initial
spins as large as 0.9997. We evolve superposed Kerr-Schild data sets
with spins of 0.93 and 0.97 and find that the spin drops by only a few
parts in 10^{4} during the initial relaxation; therefore, we
expect that superposed Kerr-Schild initial data will allow evolutions of
binary black holes with relaxed spins above 0.99. Along the way to these
conclusions, we also present several secondary results: the power-law
coefficients with which the spin of puncture initial data approaches its
maximal possible value; approximate analytic solutions for large spin
puncture data; embedding diagrams for single spinning black holes in
methods (i) and (ii); nonunique solutions for method (ii). All of the
initial-data sets that we construct contain subextremal black holes, and
when we are able to push the spin of the excision boundary surface into
the superextremal regime, the excision surface is always enclosed by a
second, subextremal apparent horizon. The quasilocal spin is measured by
using approximate rotational Killing vectors, and the spin is also
inferred from the extrema of the intrinsic scalar curvature of the
apparent horizon. Both approaches are found to give consistent results,
with the approximate-Killing-vector spin showing the least variation
during the initial relaxation.

with L{\sime}L_{crit} produce our largest dimensionless Kerr
parameter for the remnant, j=J/M^{2}{\sime}0.724{\plusmn}0.13 (to
be compared with the Kerr parameter j{\sime}0.69 resulting from
quasicircular inspirals). This value is in good agreement with the value
of 0.72 reported in [I. Hinder, B. Vaishnav, F. Herrmann, D. Shoemaker,
and P. Laguna, Phys. Rev. D 77, 081502
(2008).PRVDAQ0556-282110.1103/PhysRevD.77.081502]. These conclusions are
quite insensitive to the initial separation of the holes, and they can
be understood by extrapolating point-particle results. Generalizing a
model recently proposed by Buonanno, Kidder and Lehner [A. Buonanno, L.
E. Kidder, and L. Lehner, Phys. Rev. D 77, 026004
(2008).PRVDAQ0556-282110.1103/PhysRevD.77.026004] to eccentric binaries,
we conjecture that (1) j{\sime}0.724 is close to the maximal Kerr
parameter that can be obtained by any merger of nonspinning holes, and
(2) no binary merger (even if the binary members are extremal Kerr black
holes with spins aligned to the orbital angular momentum, and the
inspiral is highly eccentric) can violate the cosmic censorship
conjecture.

two, independent, numerical relativity (NR) simulations of inspiralling
and/or coalescing binary black-hole systems: published Caltech-Cornell
inspiral data (considered for gravitational wave frequencies
M{$\omega$}{\le}0.1) on one side, and newly computed coalescence data on the
other side. The resulting, approximately unique, {\ldquo}best-fit{\rdquo}
EOB waveform is then shown to exhibit excellent agreement with NR
coalescence data for several mass ratios. The dephasing between this
best-fit EOB waveform and published Caltech-Cornell inspiral data is
found to vary between -0.0014 and +0.0008 radians over a time span of
{\tilde}2464M up to gravitational wave frequency M{$\omega$}=0.1, and
between +0.0013 and -0.0185 over a time span of 96M after M{$\omega$}=0.1
up to M{$\omega$}=0.1565. The dephasings between EOB and the new
coalescence data are found to be smaller than: (i) {\plusmn}0.025 radians
over a time span of 730M (11 cycles) up to merger, in the equal-mass
case, and (ii) {\plusmn}0.05 radians over a time span of about 950M (17
cycles) up to merger in the 2{\ratio}1 mass-ratio case. These new results
corroborate the aptitude of the EOB formalism to provide accurate
representations of general relativistic waveforms, which are needed by
currently operating gravitational wave detectors.

in ideal hydrodynamics, caused by a breaking of the scale invariance of
ideal fluid dynamics by the freeze-out condition. Viscous hydrodynamics
shows somewhat larger scale-breaking effects that increase with
increasing {$\eta$}/s and decreasing system size and initial energy

Maxwellian, with a characteristic temperature set by the upstream

is best fitted as a power law in energy with index -2.4 +/- 0.1,

with time of the simulation, leaving a larger power-law range. The
number of particles in the tail is \~{}1\% of the downstream population, and
they carry \~{}10\% of the kinetic energy in the downstream region.
Investigating the trajectories of particles in the tail, we find that

instability. We compare this mechanism to the first-order Fermi
acceleration and set a lower limit on the efficiency of the shock

longitudinally boost-invariant systems without azimuthal symmetry around

longitudinal and accelerate the transverse hydrodynamic expansion. For
fixed initial conditions, this leads to a longer quark-gluon plasma

with QCD. We study in particular the limiting case where the mass of the

exactly: a Schr{\"o}dinger equation can be established for the
correlator of the heavy quarks; the interaction effects exponentiate,
leading to a simple instantaneous effective potential for this

which the Q{\= Q} pair propagates. In the case where the medium is a
plasma of photons and light charged fermions, an imaginary part develops
in this effective potential. We discuss the physical interpretation of
this imaginary part in terms of the collisions between the heavy
particles and the light fermions of the medium; the same collisions also
determine the damping rate of the heavy fermions. Finally we study the
connection between the real-time propagator of the heavy fermion pair

propagator is the free energy calculated in the imaginary-time

 abstract = "{Gravitational waveforms from the inspiral and ring-down stages of the
binary black-hole coalescences can be modeled accurately by
approximation/perturbation techniques in general relativity. Recent
progress in numerical relativity has enabled us to model also the
nonperturbative merger phase of the binary black-hole coalescence
problem. This enables us to coherently search for all three stages of
the coalescence of nonspinning binary black holes using a single
template bank. Taking our motivation from these results, we propose a
family of template waveforms which can model the inspiral, merger, and
ring-down stages of the coalescence of nonspinning binary black holes
that follow quasicircular inspiral. This two-dimensional template family
is explicitly parametrized by the physical parameters of the binary. We
show that the template family is not only effectual in detecting the
signals from black-hole coalescences, but also faithful in estimating
the parameters of the binary. We compare the sensitivity of a search (in
the context of different ground-based interferometers) using all three
stages of the black-hole coalescence with other template-based searches
which look for individual stages separately. We find that the proposed
search is significantly more sensitive than other template-based
searches for a substantial mass range, potentially bringing about
remarkable improvement in the event rate of ground-based
interferometers. As part of this work, we also prescribe a general
procedure to construct interpolated template banks using nonspinning
black-hole waveforms produced by numerical relativity.

detailed study of the centrality dependence of v_{2} over a

To discuss the nonflow effect, we have performed the first analysis of
v_{2} with the Lee-Yang zero method for
K_{S}^{0} and {$\Lambda$}. In the relatively low
p_{T} region, p_{T}{\les}2GeV/c, a scaling with
m_{T}-m is observed for identified hadrons in each centrality
bin studied. However, we do not observe v_{2}(p_{T})
scaled by the participant eccentricity to be independent of centrality.
At higher p_{T},2{\les}p_{T}{\les}6GeV/c,v_{2}
scales with quark number for all hadrons studied. For the multistrange
hadron {$\Omega$}, which does not suffer appreciable hadronic interactions,
the values of v_{2} are consistent with both m_{T}-m
scaling at low p_{T} and number-of-quark scaling at intermediate
p_{T}. As a function of collision centrality, an increase of
p_{T}-integrated v_{2} scaled by the participant
eccentricity has been observed, indicating a stronger collective flow in
more central Au+Au collisions.

of this subject is intermediate: we have a good qualitative
understanding of backreaction effects pointing to a global instability
of the standard model of cosmology; exact solutions and perturbative
results modeling this instability lie in the right sector to explain
Dark Energy from inhomogeneities. It is fair to say that, even if

a high-accuracy numerical simulation of 15 orbits of an inspiralling

precisely: (i) in the gravitational wave (GW) frequency domain
M{$\omega$}{\lt}0.08 where the phase of one of the nonresummed {\ldquo}Taylor
approximant{\rdquo} (T4) waveform matches well with the numerical
relativity one, we find that the EOB phase fares as well, while (ii) for
higher GW frequencies, 0.08{\lt}M{$\omega$}{\lsim}0.14, where the Taylor T4
approximant starts to significantly diverge from the numerical
relativity phase, we show that the EOB phase continues to match well the
numerical relativity one. We further propose various methods of tuning
the two inspiral flexibility parameters, a_{5} and
v_{pole}, of the EOB waveform so as to {\ldquo}best fit{\rdquo}
EOB predictions to numerical data. We find that the maximal dephasing
between EOB and numerical relativity can then be reduced below
10^{-3} GW cycles over the entire span (30 GW cycles) of the
simulation (while, without tuning them, the dephasing is
{\lt}8{\times}10^{-3} cycles). In addition, our resummed EOB
amplitude agrees much better with the numerical relativity one than any
of the previously considered nonresummed, post-Newtonian one (including
a recently derived, nonresummed 3 PN-accurate one). We think that the

driven, event by event, by the initial eccentricity of the matter
created in the nuclear overlap zone. Interpretation of the anisotropic
flow data thus requires a detailed understanding of the effective
initial source eccentricity of the event sample. In this paper, we
investigate various ways of defining this effective eccentricity using
the Monte Carlo Glauber (MCG) approach. In particular, we examine the
participant eccentricity, which quantifies the eccentricity of the
initial source shape by the major axes of the ellipse formed by the
interaction points of the participating nucleons. We show that
reasonable variation of the density parameters in the Glauber
calculation, as well as variations in how matter production is modeled,
do not significantly modify the already established behavior of the
participant eccentricity as a function of collision centrality. Focusing
on event-by-event fluctuations and correlations of the distributions of
participating nucleons, we demonstrate that, depending on the achieved
event-plane resolution, fluctuations in the elliptic flow magnitude
v_{2} lead to most measurements being sensitive to the
root-mean-square rather than the mean of the v_{2} distribution.
Neglecting correlations among participants, we derive analytical
expressions for the participant eccentricity cumulants as a function of
the number of participating nucleons, N_{part}, keeping
nonnegligible contributions up to O(1/N_{part}^{3}). We
find that the derived expressions yield the same results as obtained
from mixed-event MCG calculations which remove the correlations stemming
from the nuclear collision process. Most importantly, we conclude from
the comparison with MCG calculations that the fourth-order participant
eccentricity cumulant does not approach the spatial anisotropy obtained
assuming a smooth nuclear matter distribution. In particular, for the
Cu+Cu system, these quantities deviate from each other by almost a
factor of 2 over a wide range in centrality. This deviation reflects the
essential role of participant spatial correlations in the interaction of
two nuclei.

0.05 radians, dominated by effects arising from the small residual spins
of the black holes and the small residual orbital eccentricity in the
simulations. Matching numerical results to PN waveforms early in the run
yields excellent agreement (within 0.05 radians) over the first
{\tilde}15 cycles, thus validating the numerical simulation and
establishing a regime where PN theory is accurate. In the last 15 cycles
to merger, however, generic time-domain Taylor approximants build up
phase differences of several radians. But, apparently by coincidence,
one specific post-Newtonian approximant, TaylorT4 at 3.5PN order, agrees
much better with the numerical simulations, with accumulated phase
differences of less than 0.05 radians over the 30-cycle waveform.
Gravitational-wave amplitude comparisons are also done between numerical
simulations and post-Newtonian, and the agreement depends on the
post-Newtonian order of the amplitude expansion: the amplitude
difference is about 6\% 7\% for zeroth order and becomes smaller for
increasing order. A newly derived 3.0PN amplitude correction improves
agreement significantly ({\lt}1\% amplitude difference throughout most of

 abstract = "{Binary black-hole systems with spins aligned with the orbital angular
momentum are of special interest, as studies indicate that this
configuration is preferred in nature due to non-vacuum environmental
interactions, as well as post-Newtonian (PN) spin-orbit couplings. If
the spins of the two bodies differ, there can be a prominent beaming of
the gravitational radiation during the late plunge, causing a recoil of
the final merged black hole. In this paper we perform an accurate and
systematic study of recoil velocities from a sequence of equal-mass
black holes whose spins are aligned with the orbital angular momentum,
and whose individual spins range from a=+0.584 to -0.584. In this way we
extend and refine the results of a previous study which concentrated on
the antialigned portion of this sequence, to arrive at a consistent
maximum recoil of 448{\plusmn}5km/s for antialigned models as well as to
a phenomenological expression for the recoil velocity as a function of
spin ratio. Quite surprisingly, this relation highlights a nonlinear
behavior, not predicted by the PN estimates, and can be readily employed
in astrophysical studies on the evolution of binary black holes in
massive galaxies. An essential result of our analysis, without which no
systematic behavior can be found, is the identification of different
stages in the waveform, including a transient due to lack of an initial
linear momentum in the initial data. Furthermore, by decomposing the
recoil computation into coupled modes, we are able to identify a pair of
terms which are largely responsible for the kick, indicating that an
accurate computation can be obtained from modes up to {\ell}=3. Finally,
we provide accurate measures of the radiated energy and angular
momentum, finding these to increase linearly with the spin ratio, and
derive simple expressions for the final spin and the radiated angular
momentum which can be easily implemented in N-body simulations of
compact stellar systems. Our code is calibrated with strict convergence
tests and we verify the correctness of our measurements by using
multiple independent methods whenever possible.

adding a 4-post-Newtonian order correction in the EOB radial potential

performances with numerical waveforms of mass ratios
m_{1}/m_{2}=1, 3/2, 2 and 4, m_{1} and
m_{2} being the individual black-hole masses. The final
black-hole mass and spin predicted by the numerical simulations are used
to determine the ringdown frequency and decay time of three
quasinormal-mode damped sinusoids that are attached to the EOB

might be tested and further improved in the future by comparison with

structure package. It is a modification and extension of the GRASP92
package by [F.A. Parpia, C. Froese Fischer, I.P. Grant, Comput. Phys.
Comm. 94 (1996) 249]. For the sake of continuity, two versions are
included. Version 1 retains the GRASP92 formats for wave functions and
expansion coefficients, but no longer requires preprocessing and more
default options have been introduced. Modifications have eliminated some
errors, improved the stability, and simplified interactive use. The
transition code has been extended to cases where the initial and final
states have different orbital sets. Several utility programs have been
added. Whereas Version 1 constructs a single interaction matrix for all
the J's and parities, Version 2 treats each J and parity as a separate
matrix. This block structure results in a reduction of memory use and
considerably shorter eigenvectors. Additional tools have been developed
for this format. The CPU intensive parts of Version 2 have been
parallelized using MPI. The package includes a {\ldquo}make{\rdquo}
facility that relies on environment variables. These make it easier to
port the application to different platforms. The present version
supports the 32-bit Linux and ibmSP environments where the former is
compatible with many Unix systems. Descriptions of the features and the
program/data flow of the package will be given in some detail in this
report. Catalogue identifier: ADZL\_v1\_0 Program summary

or more Classification: 2.1 Nature of problem: Prediction of atomic
spectra{\mdash}atomic energy levels, oscillator strengths, and radiative
decay rates{\mdash}using a {\lsquo}fully relativistic{\rsquo} approach.
Solution method: Atomic orbitals are assumed to be four-component spinor
eigenstates of the angular momentum operator, j=l+s, and the parity
operator {$\Pi$}={$\beta$}{$\pi$}. Configuration state functions (CSFs) are
linear combinations of Slater determinants of atomic orbitals, and are
simultaneous eigenfunctions of the atomic electronic angular momentum
operator, J, and the atomic parity operator, P. Approximate atomic state
functions (ASFs) are linear combinations of CSFs. A variational
functional may be constructed by combining expressions for the energies
of one or more ASFs. Average energy level (EAL) functionals are weighted
sums of energies of all possible ASFs that may be constructed from a set
of CSFs; the number of ASFs is then the same as the number of CSFs.
Extended optimal level (EOL) functionals are weighted sums of energies
of some subset of ASFs. Radial functions may be determined by
numerically solving the multiconfiguration Dirac Hartree Fock (MCDHF)
equations that define an extremum of the variational functional by the
self-consistent-field (SCF) method. Lists of CSFs are generated from a
set of reference CSFs and rules for deriving other CSFs from these.
Expansion coefficients are obtained using sparse-matrix methods for
solving the relativistic configuration interaction (CI) problem.
Transition properties for pairs of ASFs are computed from matrix
elements of multipole operators of the electromagnetic field.
Biorthogonal transformation methods are employed so that all matrix
elements between CSFs can be evaluated using Racah algebra.
Restrictions: The maximum number of radial orbitals is limited to 120 by
the packing algorithm used for 32-bit integers. The maximum size of a
multiconfiguration (MC) calculation, as measured by the length of the
configuration state function (CSF) list, is limited by numerical
stability, processing time, or storage which may be either in memory or
on disk. Numerical stability is the same as GRASP92 [F.A. Parpia, C.
Froese Fischer, I.P. Grant, Comput. Phys. Comm. 94 (1996) 249] with a
slight improvement in memory management for Version 2 codes. Sufficient
disk space is needed to store angular data. In configuration interaction
calculations the matrix may be either in memory or on disk. The tables
of coefficients of fractional parentage, as in GRASP92, are limited to
subshells with j{\les}7/2; occupied subshells with j=9/2 are, therefore,
restricted to a maximum of two electrons. Unusual features: The
installation process has been simplified so that pre-processing of the
raw code needed with GRASP92 can be eliminated. Dynamic memory
allocation reduces the number of parameters needed to define fixed array
dimensions to nine. The corrections discussed in [C. Froese Fischer, G.
Gaigalas, Y. Ralchenko, Comput. Phys. Comm. 175 (2006) 739] have also
been implemented. Environment variables are used to facilitate the
compilation of the libraries, applications, and tools with different
compilers on different platforms. Computationally intensive applications
have been parallelized using the message passing interface (MPI). When
standard output is redirected, prompts and critical information about
the progress of a calculation or convergence are still directed to the
screen through the standard error output unit. Running time: CPU time
required to execute test cases: 5 min (n=4 calculation with 2190 CSFs)
and 52.7 minutes (n=5 calculation with 6752 CSFs)

different values of the mass ratio (from q=M_{2}/M_{1}=1

the waveforms onto spin-weighted spherical harmonics, characterized by
angular indices (l,m). We find that the post-Newtonian equations predict
remarkably well the relation between the wave amplitude and the orbital
frequency for each (l,m), and that the convergence of the post-Newtonian
series to the numerical results is nonmonotonic. To leading order, the
total energy emitted in the merger phase scales like {$\eta$}^{2}
and the spin of the final black hole scales like {$\eta$}, where
{$\eta$}=q/(1+q)^{2} is the symmetric mass ratio. We study the
multipolar distribution of the radiation, finding that odd-l multipoles
are suppressed in the equal mass limit. Higher multipoles carry a larger
fraction of the total energy as q increases. We introduce and compare
three different definitions for the ringdown starting time. Applying
linear-estimation methods (the so-called Prony methods) to the ringdown
phase, we find resolution-dependent time variations in the fitted
parameters of the final black hole. By cross correlating information
from different multipoles, we show that ringdown fits can be used to
obtain precise estimates of the mass and spin of the final black hole,
which are in remarkable agreement with energy and angular momentum
balance calculations.

show this, first calculate the thermodynamic critical field by equating
the energy-density penalty H^{2}/8{$\pi$} for expelling a magnetic
field with the condensation-energy density gain for pairing
N({\gammav}_{F}){$\Delta$}^{2}/2. They are equal at the
thermodynamic critical field H_{c}:
H_{}=4{$\pi$}N({\gammav}_{}){$\Delta$}. We define HcZ as the
critical Zeeman field at which superconductivity would be destroyed by
the purely Zeeman effect. Under an applied field a normal Fermi gas
acquires a magnetization M = {$\chi$}_{P}H due to the Zeeman
effect, with the Pauli susceptibility
{$\chi$}_{}=2N({\gammav}_{}){$\mu$}B2 (see, e.g., Ref. [117]).
At HcZ, the energy gained by magnetizing is equal to the BCS
condensation energy:
{$\chi$}_{}(HcZ)^{}2=N({\gammav}_{}){$\Delta$}^{}2,
or
HcZ={$\Delta$}N({\gammav}_{})/{$\chi$}_{}={$\Delta$}/2{$\mu$}_{},
a field known as the Clogston upper limit [84] for the critical field of
a superconductor. The ratio H_{}/HcZ therefore satisfies
Hc2(HcZ)^{}=3^{}23e^{}n^{}mc^{},
with n the electron density. Since the ratio on the right side is the
Coulomb energy divided by the electron rest energy, clearly it is {\Lt}1.
Hence, in conventional superconductors, superconductivity is destroyed
by orbital effects long before the Zeeman effect comes into play. Models
that yield the FFLO state essentially assume the opposite.The situation
in type-II superconductors is even less hopeful as there at the lower
critical field H_{c1} {\lt} H_{c}, the vortex lattice
appears, further obscuring effects of the Zeeman field.One may ask
whether more complicated FFLO-type pairing states, containing more
Fourier components, are more stable. The simplest such generalization,
referred to as the Larkin-Ovchinnikov (LO) state [87], takes the form
{$\Delta$}(r) = {$\Delta$}_{Q} cos Q {\middot} r. Using a finite
temperature Ginzburg Landau analysis, LO in fact showed that the LO
order parameter has slightly lower energy than the single plane wave
ansatz, which we refer to as the Fulde Ferrell (FF) state [86]. In fact,
subsequent work [94] has found that states containing even more Q
vectors are slightly more favorable. Fortunately, such more complicated
FFLO-type states are generally found [93,90] to be only marginally more
stable than the FF state we consider here (see, however, Ref. [94,103]).
This implies that although the true ground state is very likely more
complicated, possessing a richer real-space structure, the region of the
phase diagram where we find the FFLO state should be quantitatively
accurate. Of course, the difficulty of finding the true FFLO-type ground
state (unsolved even in the simpler case of an infinite homogeneous
three dimensional system), is further complicated in the setting of
atomic physics experiments that are typically conducted a harmonic trap.
[41,53].In Ref. [94] Bowers and Rajagopal (BR) studied a large class of
generalized FFLO states, finding that states having more Fourier
components Q (forming a FCC crystal structure) are much lower in energy
than the single plane-wave state studied here. Based on this instability
BR argued that such generalized crystalline superfluid FFLO states may
be stable over a far larger range of Zeeman fields than the single-Q
FFLO state considered here. Although intriguing, we do not find these
arguments persuasive enough to overturn the predictions of our detailed
controlled calculation, that is consistent with a general wisdom on this
issue. Firstly, Ref. [94] is based on a Landau [Taylor expansion
E({$\Delta$}_{Q}) in {$\Delta$}_{Q}] expansion at T = 0 for a
strongly first-order transition. As a result there is no small parameter
that controls or validates predictions that follow from this
uncontrolled Taylor expansion. Consistent with this concern, BR find the
energy of these states to be unbounded from below. Furthermore, as
discussed above [102], these results of BR directly contradict other
work [87,93,90] on this issue that find such more complicated FFLO
states to be only marginally more stable.Since {$\gamma$} is inversely
proportional to {\gammav}_{}, i.e., the proper measure of the
width of the resonance is in its relation to the Fermi energy, it is
quite conceivable that even presently studied Feshbach resonances can be
made to be narrow in this dimensionless sense, by considerably
increasing the size of the atomic cloud.The FFLO {\rarr} N transition is
only continuous within mean-field theory, and can be argued to be
generically driven first order by fluctuations. [106

Superconductivity1996McGraw-HillRecently, a number of papers [47,67]
have appeared in the literature with a mean-field phase diagram for
resonantly interacting fermions that disagrees qualitatively with our
mean-field phase diagram reported in Ref. [36] (particularly in the
negative-detuning BEC regime). These Refs. [47,67] also disagree with
other recent work [64,75,78] on the one and two-channel models that are
in agreement with our results. [36] We believe the origin of this
discrepancy is that the authors of Refs. [47,67] erroneously study
solutions of the gap equation that are maxima or saddle points (rather
than minima) and which do not correspond to any physical ground state of
the system; this thereby leads to incorrect results (see also Ref.
[122]). The authors of Ref. [45] (and references therein) erroneously
report a polarization-dependent gap of the BCS state [Eq.(1) of Ref.
[45]] that is actually the polarization dependence of the unstable Sarma
solution [a local maximum of E_{G}({$\Delta$})],
{$\Delta$}_{}{$\Delta$}_{}=1-43{$\Delta$}NN{\gammav}_{}{$\Delta$}_{},
obtained by combining Eqs. (approximating {$\mu$}{\#710}{\sime}1 for
simplicity). Such problems stem from the existence of first-order
transitions at finite h (where E_{G} exhibits maxima and saddle
points), but do not arise at h = 0.D.E. Sheehy and L. Radzihovsky,
preprint cond-mat/0608172.Subsequent to the initial appearence of the
preprint of this manuscript, as well as our Comment (Ref. [122]) on Ref.
[47], the authors of Ref. [67] altered their previously incorrect phase
diagram (appearing in versions 1,2,3 of cond-mat/0604184). The published
version now appears to be in agreement with our work, at least in the
equal-mass case considered here.Note that here we used a more general
expression for e_{G,SF} than is necessary for the computation of
{$\Delta$}_{}. This is necessary for the computation of
{\^h}_{c1} and {\^h}_{c2} in Section .Since we are
studying a homogeneous {\ldquo}box{\rdquo} trap, fixed N corresponds to
fixed uniform density. We will generalize this to a fixed N in the
experimentally-relevant case of a harmonic trap in Section

 abstract = "{We investigate the dynamics and gravitational-wave (GW) emission in the
binary merger of equal-mass black holes as obtained from numerical
relativity simulations. The simulations were performed with an evolution
code based on generalized harmonic coordinates developed by Pretorius,
and used quasiequilibrium initial-data sets constructed by Cook and
Pfeiffer. Results from the evolution of three sets of initial data are
explored in detail, corresponding to different initial separations of
the black holes, and exhibit between 2 8 GW cycles before coalescence.
We find that to a good approximation the inspiral phase of the evolution
is quasicircular, followed by a {\ldquo}blurred, quasicircular
plunge{\rdquo} lasting for about 1 1.5 GW cycles. After this plunge the
GW frequency decouples from the orbital frequency, and we define this
time to be the start of the merger phase. Roughly 10 15 M separates the
time between the beginning of the merger phase and when we are able to
extract quasinormal ring-down modes from gravitational waves emitted by
the newly formed black hole. This suggests that the merger lasts for a
correspondingly short amount of time, approximately 0.5 0.75 of a full
GW cycle. We present first-order comparisons between analytical models
of the various stages of the merger and the numerical results{\mdash}more
detailed and accurate comparisons will need to await numerical
simulations with higher accuracy, better control of systemic errors
(including coordinate artifacts), and initial configurations where the
binaries are further separated. During the inspiral, we find that if the
orbital phase is well modeled, the leading order Newtonian quadrupole
formula is able to match both the amplitude and phase of the numerical
GW quite accurately until close to the point of merger. We provide
comparisons between the numerical results and analytical predictions
based on the adiabatic post-Newtonian (PN) and nonadiabatic resummed-PN
models (effective-one-body and Pad{\'e} models). For all models
considered, 3PN and 3.5PN orders match the inspiral numerical data the
best. From the ring-down portion of the GW, we extract the fundamental
quasinormal mode and several of the overtones. Finally, we estimate the
optimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for typical binaries detectable by
GW experiments. We find that, when the merger and ring-down phases are
included, binaries with total mass larger than 40M_{ȯ}
(sources for ground-based detectors) are brought in band and can be
detected with signal-to-noise up to {\ap}15 at 100 Mpc, whereas for
binaries with total mass larger than
2{\times}10^{6}M_{ȯ} (sources for space-based
detectors) the SNR can be {\ap}10^{4} at 1 Gpc.

significantly higher accuracy than has been done in the past. In
particular, the position of the critical point at filling factor  n=1 is
found to be at  (U/t)_{c}=29.34(2) , and the insulating gap
{$\Delta$}  is measured with accuracy of a few percent of the hopping
amplitude  t . We obtain the effective mass of particle and hole
excitations in the insulating state{\mdash}with explicit demonstration of
the emerging particle-hole symmetry and relativistic dispersion law at
the transition tip{\mdash}along with the sound velocity in the strongly
correlated superfluid phase. These parameters are the necessary
ingredients to perform analytic estimates of the low temperature
(T{\Lt}{$\Delta$})  thermodynamics in macroscopic samples. We present
accurate thermodynamic curves, including these for specific heat and
entropy, for typical insulating  (U/t=40)  and superfluid  (t/U=0.0385)
phases. Our data can serve as a basis for accurate experimental
thermometry, and a guide for appropriate initial conditions if one
attempts to use interacting bosons in quantum information processing.

of the lightest stable particle in a generic new model of particle
physics. Method of solution: In numerically solving the evolution
equation for the density of dark matter, relativistic formulae for the
thermal average are used. All tree-level processes for annihilation and
coannihilation of new particles in the model are included. The
cross-sections for all processes are calculated exactly with CalcHEP
after definition of a model file. Higher-order QCD corrections to Higgs
couplings to quark pairs are included. Reasons for the new version:There
are many models of new physics that propose a candidate for dark matter
besides the much studied minimal supersymmetric standard model. This new
version not only incorporates extensions of the MSSM, such as the MSSM
with complex phases, or the NMSSM which contains an extra singlet
superfield but also gives the possibility for the user to incorporate
easily a new model. For this the user only needs to redefine
appropriately a new model file. Summary of revisions:Possibility to
include in the package any particle physics model with a discrete
symmetry that guarantees the stability of the cold dark matter candidate
(LOP) and to compute the relic density of CDM.Compute automatically the
cross-sections for annihilation of the LOP at small velocities into SM

Chief among these is the net kick received when two unequal mass or

the production and growth of supermassive black holes during the epoch
of structure formation, and on the retention of black holes in stellar
clusters. Here we report the first accurate numerical calculation of
this kick, for two nonspinning black holes in a 1.5:1 mass ratio, which
is expected on the basis of analytic considerations to give a
significant fraction of the maximum possible recoil. We have performed
multiple runs with different initial separations, orbital angular
momenta, resolutions, extraction radii, and gauges. The full range of
our kick speeds is 86-116 km s^{-1}, and the most reliable runs
give kicks between 86 and 97 km s^{-1}. This is intermediate
between the estimates from two recent post-Newtonian analyses and
suggests that at redshifts z{\gt}\~{}10, halos with masses

a black-hole spacetime using the generalized harmonic form of
Einstein{\rsquo}s equations in coordinates that rotate with respect to
the inertial frame at infinity; such evolutions are found to be
generically unstable using a single rotating-coordinate frame. The
dual-coordinate method is also used here to evolve binary black-hole
spacetimes for several orbits. The great flexibility of this method
allows comoving coordinates to be adjusted with a feedback control
system that keeps the excision boundaries of the holes within their
respective apparent horizons.

of angular momentum from orbital to spin, we start with two
quasicircular configurations, one with initially nonspinning black
holes, the other with corotating black holes. In both cases the binaries
complete almost two orbits before merging. We find that, during these
last orbits, the specific spin (a/m) of each horizon increases by only
0.012 for the initially nonspinning configuration, and by only 0.006 for
the initially corotating configuration. By contrast, the corotation
value for the specific spin should increase from 0.1 at the initial
proper separation of 10M to 0.33 when the proper separation is 5M. Thus
the spin-orbit coupling is far too weak to tidally lock the binary to a
corotating state during the late-inspiral phase. We also study the
converse transfer from spin into orbital motion. In this case, we start
the simulations with parallel, highly-spinning nonboosted black holes.
As the collision proceeds, the system acquires a non-head-on orbital
motion, due to spin-orbit coupling, that leads to the radiation of
angular momentum. We are able to accurately measure the energy and
angular momentum losses and model their dependence on the initial spins.

intensity laser and cavity systems are considered, related to quantum
electrodynamical (QED) photon-photon scattering. Current
state-of-the-art laser facilities are close to reaching energy scales at
which laboratory astrophysics will become possible. In such high energy
density laboratory astrophysical systems, quantum electrodynamics will
play a crucial role in the dynamics of plasmas and indeed the vacuum
itself. Developments such as the free-electron laser may also give a
means for exploring remote violent events such as supernovae in a
laboratory environment. At the same time, superconducting cavities have
steadily increased their quality factors, and quantum nondemolition
measurements are capable of retrieving information from systems
consisting of a few photons. Thus, not only will QED effects such as
elastic photon-photon scattering be important in laboratory experiments,
it may also be directly measurable in cavity experiments. Here
implications of collective interactions between photons and
photon-plasma systems are described. An overview of strong field vacuum
effects is given, as formulated through the Heisenberg-Euler Lagrangian.
Based on the dispersion relation for a single test photon traveling in a
slowly varying background electromagnetic field, a set of equations
describing the nonlinear propagation of an electromagnetic pulse on a
radiation plasma is derived. The stability of the governing equations is
discussed, and it is shown using numerical methods that electromagnetic
pulses may collapse and split into pulse trains, as well as be trapped
in a relativistic electron hole. Effects, such as the generation of
novel electromagnetic modes, introduced by QED in pair plasmas is
described. Applications to laser-plasma systems and astrophysical
environments are also discussed.

 abstract = "{The advent of ultraintense laser pulses generated by the technique of
chirped pulse amplification (CPA) along with the development of
high-fluence laser materials has opened up an entirely new field of
optics. The electromagnetic field intensities produced by these
techniques, in excess of  10^{18}W/cm^{2} , lead to
relativistic electron motion in the laser field. The CPA method is
reviewed and the future growth of laser technique is discussed,
including the prospect of generating the ultimate power of a zettawatt.
A number of consequences of relativistic-strength optical fields are
surveyed. In contrast to the nonrelativistic regime, these laser fields
are capable of moving matter more effectively, including motion in the
direction of laser propagation. One of the consequences of this is
wakefield generation, a relativistic version of optical rectification,
in which longitudinal field effects could be as large as the transverse
ones. In addition to this, other effects may occur, including
relativistic focusing, relativistic transparency, nonlinear modulation
and multiple harmonic generation, and strong coupling to matter and
other fields (such as high-frequency radiation). A proper utilization of
these phenomena and effects leads to the new technology of relativistic
engineering, in which light-matter interactions in the relativistic
regime drives the development of laser-driven accelerator science. A
number of significant applications are reviewed, including the fast
ignition of an inertially confined fusion target by short-pulsed laser
energy and potential sources of energetic particles (electrons, protons,
other ions, positrons, pions, etc.). The coupling of an intense laser
field to matter also has implications for the study of the highest
energies in astrophysics, such as ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays, with
energies in excess of  10^{20}eV . The laser fields can be so
intense as to make the accelerating field large enough for general
relativistic effects (via the equivalence principle) to be examined in
the laboratory. It will also enable one to access the nonlinear regime
of quantum electrodynamics, where the effects of radiative damping are
no longer negligible. Furthermore, when the fields are close to the
Schwinger value, the vacuum can behave like a nonlinear medium in much
the same way as ordinary dielectric matter expanded to laser radiation
in the early days of laser research.

[P. Braun-Munzinger, K. Redlich, J. Stachel, 2003, nucl-th/0304013. ].
In particular, with a few physical input parameters, such as the
temperature, chemical potentials, and velocity of the collective flow,
the models reproduce the observed particle abundances [P. Koch, J.

nucl-th/0212053. ; W. Florkowski, W. Broniowski, A. Baran, 2004,
nucl-th/0412077. ] in both non-strange and strange sectors. The key
element of the approach is the inclusion of the complete list of
hadronic resonances, which at the rather high temperature at freeze-out,
{\tilde}165 MeV, contribute very significantly to the observed
quantities. Their two- and three-body decays, taken from the tables,
proceed in cascades, ultimately producing the stable particles observed
in detectors. At the moment there exist several codes to compute the
abundances of particles (the publicly available programs for this
purpose are SHARE [G. Torrieri et al., 2004, nucl-th/0404083] and
THERMUS [S. Wheaton, J. Cleymans, 2004, hep-ph/0407174]), which is a
rather simple task, since the abundances are insensitive to the geometry
of the fireball and its expansion. On the other hand, the calculation of
the transverse-momentum spectra of particles is much more complicated
due to the sensitivity to these phenomena. THERMINATOR deals with this
problem, offering the full information on the space time positions and
momenta of the produced particles. As a result, the program allows to
compute very efficiently the transverse-momentum spectra of identified
particles and examine implications of the assumed expansion model.
THERMINATOR allows easily for the departure from symmetries typically
assumed in other approaches. This opens the possibility to study the
dependence of physical quantities on rapidity and the azimuthal angle.
The contribution of the resonances to various observables may be traced
conveniently, and their role in the statistical approach may be
verified. As a Monte Carlo event generator written in the
object-oriented c++ language in the ROOT [R. Brun, F. Rademakers, Nucl.
Instrum. Methods A 389 (1997) 81, http://root.cern.ch] environment,
THERMINATOR can be straightforwardly interfaced to the standard software
routinely used in the data analysis for relativistic heavy-ion
colliders, such as SPS, RHIC, and, in the future, LHC. In this way the
inclusion of experimental acceptance, kinematic cuts, or interfacing
with other programs poses no difficulty. Method of solving the
problem:THERMINATOR uses the particle data tables [Particle Data Group,
K. Hagiwara et al., Phys. Rev. D 66 (2002) 010001] in the universal
input form used by the SHARE [G. Torrieri et al., 2004, nucl-th/0404083]
package. The user decides for the thermal parameters and the preferred
expansion model. The optimum thermal parameters may be taken, e.g., as
those obtained with the help of SHARE [G. Torrieri et al., 2004,
nucl-th/0404083] or THERMUS [S. Wheaton, J. Cleymans, 2004,
hep-ph/0407174]. At the moment there are two different expansion models
implemented in the code: the model of Ref. [W. Broniowski, W.
Florkowski, Phys. Rev. Lett. 87 (2001) 272302, nucl-th/0106050], based
on the so-called Buda Lund [T. Csorgo, B. Lorstad, Phys. Rev. C 54
(1996) 1390, hep-ph/9509213] parameterization, and the Blast-Wave model
[E. Schnedermann, J. Sollfrank, U.W. Heinz, Phys. Rev. C 48 (1993) 2462,
nucl-th/9307020; F. Retiere, M.A. Lisa, Phys. Rev. C 70 (2004) 044907,
nucl-th/0312024]. The positions and velocities of the particles are
randomly generated on the hypersurface according to the statistical
(Bose Einstein of Fermi Dirac) distribution factors. All particles,
stable and unstable, are included. The particles move along classical
trajectories from their initial positions, with velocities composed of
the thermal motion and the collective expansion of the system. Stable
particles just stream freely, while the resonances decay after some
(randomly generated) time, which is controlled by the particle's
lifetime. The decays are two-body or three-body, and their
implementation involves simple kinematic formulas. The decays can
proceed in cascades, down to the stage where only stable particles are
present. All particles have tags indicating their parent. The secondary
rescatterings are not considered in this approach. Full history of the
event is stored in an output file, allowing for a detailed examination
of the space time evolutions and the calculation of the
transverse-momentum spectra. Additional comment: The ongoing analyses of
the SPS and the RHIC data as well as the future heavy-ion program at LHC
will certainly benefit from THERMINATOR as a tool for generating events
in a simple statistical model. The Monte Carlo code written in c++ and
using the standard ROOT [R. Brun, F. Rademakers, Nucl. Instrum. Methods
A 389 (1997) 81, http://root.cern.ch] environment can be easily adapted
to purposes directly linked to experimental data analyses. The space
time tracking capability will allow, in the framework of the statistical
approach, to better understand the physics of relativistic heavy-ion
collisions. THERMINATOR calculates the particle spectra and other
observables related to the space time evolution of the system. It
provides a c++ framework which may be easily developed for detailed
analyses of more involved observables such as, e.g., correlation
functions or HBT radii. Typical running time: The generation of 500
events from scratch takes about 1 hour 15 minutes on a PC with
Athlon-Barthon 2.5 GHz under Red Hat Fedora 3. Each subsequent 500
events take about 1 hour. To store 500 events about 1.1 GB disk storage
is needed, depending on the kinematic range. After converting the output
to the ROOT TTree format, 900 MB may be freed.

and merger of an equal-mass black-hole system. We track the trajectories
of the individual apparent horizons and find that the binary completed
approximately one and a third orbits before forming a common horizon.
Upon calculating the complete gravitational radiation waveform, horizon
mass, and spin, we find that the binary radiated 3.2\% of its mass and
24\% of its angular momentum. The early part of the waveform, after a
relatively short initial burst of spurious radiation, is oscillatory
with increasing amplitude and frequency, as expected from orbital
motion. The waveform then transitions to a typical {\ldquo}plunge{\rdquo}
waveform; i.e. a rapid rise in amplitude followed by quasinormal
ringing. The plunge part of the waveform is remarkably similar to the
waveform from the previously studied {\ldquo}ISCO{\rdquo} configuration.
We anticipate that the plunge waveform, when starting from quasicircular
orbits, has a generic shape that is essentially independent of the
initial separation of the binary.

 abstract = "{Black-hole uniqueness is known to fail in higher dimensions, and the
multiplicity of black hole phases leads to phase transitions physics in
General Relativity. The black-hole black-string transition is a prime
realization of such a system and its phase diagram has been the subject
of considerable study in the last few years. The most surprising results
seem to be the appearance of critical dimensions where the qualitative
behavior of the system changes, and a novel kind of topology change.
Recently, a full phase diagram was determined numerically, confirming
earlier predictions for a merger of the black-hole and black-string
phases and giving very strong evidence that the end-state of the Gregory
Laflamme instability is a black hole (in the dimension range
5{\les}D{\les}13). Here this progress is reviewed, illustrated with
figures, put into a wider context, and the still open questions are
listed.

In minimum-bias Au+Au collisions at s_{NN}=200GeV, a significant
amount of elliptic flow, comparable to other nonstrange baryons, is
observed for multistrange baryons which are expected to be particularly
sensitive to the dynamics of the partonic stage of heavy-ion collisions.
The p_{T} dependence of {$\nu$}_{2} of the multistrange
baryons confirms the number of constituent quark scaling previously
observed for lighter hadrons. These results support the idea that a
substantial fraction of the observed collective motion is developed at
the early partonic stage in ultrarelativistic nuclear collisions at the
Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider.

taken thus far with the PHOBOS detector at RHIC. In the most central Au
+ Au collisions at the highest beam energy, evidence is found for the
formation of a very high energy density system whose description in
terms of simple hadronic degrees of freedom is inappropriate.
Furthermore, the constituents of this novel system are found to undergo
a significant level of interaction. The properties of particle
production at RHIC energies are shown to follow a number of simple
scaling behaviors, some of which continue trends found at lower energies
or in simpler systems. As a function of centrality, the total number of
charged particles scales with the number of participating nucleons. When
comparing Au + Au at different centralities, the dependence of the yield
on the number of participants at higher p_{} ({\tilde}4 GeV/c) is
very similar to that at low transverse momentum. The measured values of
charged particle pseudorapidity density and elliptic flow were found to
be independent of energy over a broad range of pseudorapidities when
effectively viewed in the rest frame of one of the colliding nuclei, a
property we describe as {\ldquo}extended longitudinal scaling{\rdquo}.
Finally, the centrality and energy dependences of several observables
were found to factorize to a surprising degree.

shows that the stochastic method is fully covariant and that convergency
is achieved more efficiently than within a standard geometrical
formulation of the collision term, especially for high gluon interaction
rates. The cascade is then applied to simulate parton evolution and to
investigate thermalization of gluons for a central Au+Au collision at
RHIC energy. For this study the initial conditions are assumed to be
generated by independent minijets with p_{T}{\gt}p_{0}=2
GeV. With that choice it is demonstrated that overall kinetic
equilibration is driven mainly by the inelastic processes and is
achieved on a scale of 1 fm/c. The further evolution of the expanding
gluonic matter in the central region then shows almost an ideal
hydrodynamical behavior. In addition, full chemical equilibration of the
gluons follows on a longer time scale of about 3 fm/c.

Nature of the physical problem: Statistical analysis of particle
production in relativistic heavy-ion collisions involves the formation
and the subsequent decays of a large number of resonances. With the
physical input of thermal parameters, such as the temperature and
fugacities, and considering cascading decays, along with weak
interaction feed-down corrections, the observed hadron abundances are
obtained. SHARE incorporates diverse physical approaches, with a
flexibility of choice of the details of the statistical hadronization
model, including the selection of a chemical (non-)equilibrium
condition. SHARE also offers evaluation of the extensive properties of
the source of particles, such as energy, entropy, baryon number,
strangeness, as well as the determination of the best intensive input
parameters fitting a set of experimental yields. This allows exploration
of a proposed physical hypothesis about hadron production mechanisms and
the determination of the properties of their source. Method of solving
the problem: Distributions at freeze-out of both the stable particles
and the hadronic resonances are set according to a statistical
prescription, technically calculated via a series of Bessel functions,
using CERN library programs. We also have the option of including finite
particle widths of the resonances. While this is computationally
expensive, it is necessary to fully implement the essence of the strong
interaction dynamics within the statistical hadronization picture. In
fact, including finite width has a considerable effect when modeling
directly detectable short-lived resonances
({$\Lambda$}(1520),K^{∗}, etc.), and is noticeable in fits
to experimentally measured yields of stable particles. After production,
all hadronic resonances decay. Resonance decays are accomplished by
addition of the parent abundances to the daughter, normalized by the
branching ratio. Weak interaction decays receive a special treatment,
where we introduce daughter particle acceptance factors for both
strongly interacting decay products. An interface for fitting to
experimental particle ratios of the statistical model parameters with
the help of MINUIT[1] is provided. The {$\chi$}^{2} function is
defined in the standard way. For an investigated quantity f and
experimental error {$\Delta$}f,
{$\chi$}^{2}=(f^{experiment<SUB>‑ftheory</SUB>)2}({$\Delta$}^{f<SUB>statistical</SUB>+Δf<SUB>systematic</SUB>)2},
N_{DoF}=N_{data points}{\minus}N_{free
parameters}. (note that systematic and statistical errors are
independent, since the systematic error is not a random variable). Aside
of {$\chi$}^{2}, the program also calculates the statistical
significance [2], defined as the probability that, given a
{\ldquo}true{\rdquo} theory and a statistical (Gaussian) experimental
error, the fitted {$\chi$}^{2} assumes the values at or above the
considered value. In the case that the best fit has statistical
significance significantly below unity, the model under consideration is
very likely inappropriate. In the limit of many degrees of freedom
(N_{DoF}), the statistical significance function depends only on
{$\chi$}^{2}/N_{DoF}, with 90\% statistical significance at
{$\chi$}^{2}/N_{DoF}{\tilde}1, and falling steeply at
{$\chi$}^{2}/N_{DoF}{\gt}1. However, the degrees of freedom
in fits involving ratios are generally not sufficient to reach the
asymptotic limit. Hence, statistical significance depends strongly on
{$\chi$}^{2} and N_{DoF} separately. In particular, if
N_{DoF}{\lt}20, often for a fit to have an acceptable statistical
significance, a {$\chi$}^{2}/N_{DoF} significantly less
than 1 is required. The fit routine does not always find the true lowest
{$\chi$}^{2} minimum. Specifically, multi-parameter fits with too
few degrees of freedom generally exhibit a non-trivial structure in
parameter space, with several secondary minima, saddle points, valleys,
etc. To help the user perform the minimization effectively, we have
added tools to compute the {$\chi$}^{2} contours and profiles. In
addition, our program's flexibility allows for many strategies in
performing the fit. It is therefore possible, by following the
techniques described in Section 3.7, to scan the parameter space and
ensure that the minimum found is the true one. Further systematic
deviations between the model and experiment can be recognized via the
program's output, which includes a particle-by-particle comparison
between experiment and theory. Additional comments: In consideration of
the wide stream of new data coming out from RHIC, there is an on-going
activity, with several groups performing analysis of particle yields. It
is our hope that SHARE will allow to create an analysis standard within
the community. It can be useful in analyzing the experimental data,
verifying simple physical assumptions, evaluating expected yields, as
well as allowing to compare various similar models and programs which
are currently being used. Typical running time: For the Fortran code,
the computation time with the provided default input files is about 10
minutes on 1 GHz processor. The time may rise significantly (by a factor
of 300) if the full-fledged optimization and finite widths are included.
In Mathematica, the typical running times are of the order of minutes.

observational aspects from the existing literature, as well as
performing new analyses. We argue that during the rising phase of a
black hole transient outburst the steady jet known to be associated with
the canonical `low/hard' state persists while the X-ray spectrum
initially softens. Subsequently, the jet becomes unstable and an
optically thin radio outburst is always associated with the soft X-ray
peak at the end of this phase of softening. This peak corresponds to a
`soft very high state' or `steep power-law' state. Softer X-ray states
are not associated with `core' radio emission. We further demonstrate
quantitatively that the transient jets associated with these optically
thin events are considerably more relativistic than those in the
`low/hard' X-ray state. This in turn implies that, as the disc makes its
collapse inwards, the jet Lorentz factor rapidly increases, resulting in
an internal shock in the outflow, which is the cause of the observed
optically thin radio emission. We provide simple estimates for the
efficiency of such a shock in the collision of a fast jet with a
previously generated outflow that is only mildly relativistic. In
addition, we estimate the jet power for a number of such transient
events as a function of X-ray luminosity, and find them to be comparable
to an extrapolation of the functions estimated for the `low/hard' state
jets. The normalization may be larger, however, which may suggest a
contribution from some other power source such as black hole spin, for
the transient jets. Finally, we attempt to fit these results together
into a coherent semiquantitative model for the disc-jet coupling in all
black hole X-ray binary systems.

a number of successful predictions regarding galactic dynamics; these
are made without the assumption that dark matter plays a significant
role. MOND requires gravitation to depart from Newtonian theory in the
extragalactic regime where dynamical accelerations are small. So far
relativistic gravitation theories proposed to underpin MOND have either
clashed with the post-Newtonian tests of general relativity, or failed
to provide significant gravitational lensing, or violated hallowed
principles by exhibiting superluminal scalar waves or an a priori vector
field. We develop a relativistic MOND inspired theory which resolves
these problems. In it gravitation is mediated by metric, a scalar, and a
4-vector field, all three dynamical. For a simple choice of its free
function, the theory has a Newtonian limit for nonrelativistic dynamics
with significant acceleration, but a MOND limit when accelerations are
small. We calculate the {$\beta$} and {$\gamma$} parameterized post-Newtonian
coefficients showing them to agree with solar system measurements. The
gravitational light deflection by nonrelativistic systems is governed by
the same potential responsible for dynamics of particles. To the extent
that MOND successfully describes dynamics of a system, the new
theory{\rsquo}s predictions for lensing by that system{\rsquo}s visible
matter will agree as well with observations as general
relativity{\rsquo}s predictions made with a dynamically successful dark
halo model. Cosmological models based on the theory are quite similar to
those based on general relativity; they predict slow evolution of the
scalar field. For a range of initial conditions, this last result makes
it easy to rule out superluminal propagation of metric, scalar, and
vector waves.

dual to an operator in N=4 SYM theory whose conformal dimension can be
computed by diagonalizing a (generalization of) spin 1/2 Heisenberg

corresponding large J limit of the classical

that this agreement extends to the next order and develop a systematic
procedure for computing higher orders in such large angular momentum
expansion. This involves several non-trivial steps. On the string side,
we need to choose a special gauge with a non-diagonal world-sheet metric
which insures that the angular momentum is uniformly distributed along
the string, as indeed is the case on the spin chain side. We need also
to implement an order by order redefinition of the field n_{i}
to get an action linear in the time derivative. On the spin chain side,
it turns out to be crucial to include the effects of integrating out
short wave-length modes. In this way we gain a better understanding of
how (a subsector of) the string sigma model emerges from the dual gauge

 abstract = "{Understanding the formation of stars in galaxies is central to much of
modern astrophysics. However, a quantitative prediction of the star
formation rate and the initial distribution of stellar masses remains
elusive. For several decades it has been thought that the star formation
process is primarily controlled by the interplay between gravity and
magnetostatic support, modulated by neutral-ion drift (known as
ambipolar diffusion in astrophysics). Recently, however, both
observational and numerical work has begun to suggest that supersonic
turbulent flows rather than static magnetic fields control star
formation. To some extent, this represents a return to ideas popular
before the importance of magnetic fields to the interstellar gas was
fully appreciated. This review gives a historical overview of the
successes and problems of both the classical dynamical theory and the
standard theory of magnetostatic support, from both observational and
theoretical perspectives. The outline of a new theory relying on control
by driven supersonic turbulence is then presented. Numerical models
demonstrate that, although supersonic turbulence can provide global
support, it nevertheless produces density enhancements that allow local
collapse. Inefficient, isolated star formation is a hallmark of
turbulent support, while efficient, clustered star formation occurs in
its absence. The consequences of this theory are then explored for both
local star formation and galactic-scale star formation. It suggests that
individual star-forming cores are likely not quasistatic objects, but
dynamically collapsing. Accretion onto these objects varies depending on
the properties of the surrounding turbulent flow; numerical models agree
with observations showing decreasing rates. The initial mass
distribution of stars may also be determined by the turbulent flow.
Molecular clouds appear to be transient objects forming and dissolving
in the larger-scale turbulent flow, or else quickly collapsing into
regions of violent star formation. Global star formation in galaxies
appears to be controlled by the same balance between gravity and
turbulence as small-scale star formation, although modulated by cooling
and differential rotation. The dominant driving mechanism in
star-forming regions of galaxies appears to be supernovae, while
elsewhere coupling of rotation to the gas through magnetic fields or
gravity may be important.

for nuclei abundances, along with the corresponding uncertainties, are
evaluated using a new numerical code, where all nuclear rates usually
considered have been updated using the most recent available data.
Moreover, additional processes neglected in previous calculations have
been included. The combined analysis of CMB and primordial
nucleosynthesis prediction for Deuterium gives an effective number of
relativistic degrees of freedom in good agreement with the simplest
scenario of three nondegenerate neutrinos. Our findings seem to point
out possible systematics affecting ^{4}He mass fraction
measurements, or the effect of exotic physics, like a slightly
degenerate relic neutrino background.

exact treatment of a finite in-medium path length; it includes the case
of a dynamically expanding medium, and it extends to the angular
dependence of the medium-induced gluon radiation pattern. All
calculations are done in the multiple soft scattering approximation
[Baier-Dokshitzer-Mueller-Peign{\'e}-Schiff-Zakharov (BDMPSZ)

approximation]. By comparison, we establish a simple relation between
the transport coefficient, Debye screening mass and opacity, for which
both approximations lead to comparable results. Together with this
paper, a CPU-inexpensive numerical subroutine for calculating quenching
weights is provided electronically. To illustrate its applications, we
discuss the suppression of hadronic transverse momentum spectra in
nucleus-nucleus collisions. Remarkably, the kinematic constraint
resulting from finite in-medium path lengths reduces significantly the
p_{⊥} dependence of the nuclear modification factor, thus
leading to consistency with the data measured at the BNL Relativistic

production in a dense QCD plasma is derived using a reaction operator
formalism. Analytic expressions for the induced inclusive gluon
transverse momentum and light-cone momentum distributions are derived to
all orders in powers of the opacity of the medium for gluons,
N{$\sigma$}_{g}/A_{⊥}=L/{$\lambda$}_{g}. The
reaction operator approach leads to a simple algebraic proof of the
``color triviality'' of single inclusive distributions and leads to a
solvable set of recursion relations. The analytic solution to all orders
in opacity generalizes previous continuum solutions (BDMPS) by allowing
for arbitrary correlated nuclear geometry and evolving screening scales
as well as the inclusion of finite kinematic constraints. The latter is
particularly important because below LHC energies the kinematic
constraints significantly decrease the non-abelian energy loss. Our
solution for the inclusive distribution turns out to have a much simpler
structure than the exclusive (tagged) distribution case that we studied
previously (GLV1). The analytic expressions are also obtained in a form
suitable for numerical implementation in Monte Carlo event generators to
enable more accurate calculations of jet quenching in ultra-relativistic
nuclear collisions. Numerical results illustrating the first three
orders in opacity are compared to the ``self-quenching'' hard radiation
intensity that always accompanies jet production in the vacuum. A
surprising result is that the induced gluon radiation intensity is
dominated by the (quadratic in /L) first order opacity contribution for
realistic geometries and jet energies in nuclear collisions.

were incident on solid targets and produced a strongly relativistic
interaction. The energy content, spectra, and angular patterns of the
photon, electron, and ion radiations have all been diagnosed in a number
of ways, including several novel (to laser physics) nuclear activation
techniques. About 40\%-50\% of the laser energy is converted to broadly
beamed hot electrons. Their beam centroid direction varies from shot to
shot, but the resulting bremsstrahlung beam has a consistent width.
Extraordinarily luminous ion beams (primarily protons) almost precisely
normal to the rear of various targets are seen-up to
3{\times}10^{13} protons with kTion\~{}several MeV representing \~{}6\%
of the laser energy. Ion energies up to at least 55 MeV are observed.
The ions appear to originate from the rear target surfaces. The edge of
the ion beam is very sharp, and collimation increases with ion energy.
At the highest energies, a narrow feature appears in the ion spectra,
and the apparent size of the emitting spot is smaller than the full back
surface area. Any ion emission from the front of the targets is much
less than from the rear and is not sharply beamed. The hot electrons
generate a Debye sheath with electrostatic fields of order MV per
micron, which apparently accelerate the ions.

engine: a black hole of several solar masses accreting matter from a
disk at a rate of 0.01 to 10 M\_solar s\^{}-1. Using a numerical model for
relativistic disk accretion, we have studied steady state accretion at
these high rates. Outside about 10\^{}8 cm, the disk is advection
dominated; energy released by dissipation is carried in by the optically
thick gas, and the disk does not cool. Inside this radius, for accretion
rates greater than about 0.01 M\_solar s\^{}-1 a global state of balanced
power comes to exist between neutrino losses, chiefly pair capture on
nucleons, and dissipation. As a result of these losses, the temperature
is reduced, the density is raised, and the disk scale height is reduced
compared to the advective solution. The sudden onset of neutrino losses
(due to the high temperature dependence) and photodisintegration leads
to an abrupt thinning of the disk that may provide a favorable geometry
for jet production. The inner disk remains optically thin to neutrinos
for accretion rates of up to about 1 M\_solar s\^{}-1. The energy emitted in
neutrinos is less, and in the case of low accretion rates, very much
less, than the maximum efficiency factor for black hole accretion (0.057
for no rotation; 0.42 for extreme Kerr rotation) times the accretion
rate, Mc\^{}2. Neutrino temperatures at the last stable orbit range from 2
MeV (no rotation, slow accretion) to 13 MeV (Kerr geometry, rapid
accretion), and the density ranges from 10\^{}9 to 10\^{}12 g cm\^{}-3. The
efficiency for producing a pair fireball along the rotational axis by
neutrino annihilation is calculated and found to be highly variable and
very sensitive to the accretion rate. For some of the higher accretion
rates studied, it can be several percent or more; for accretion rates
less than 0.05 M\_solar s\^{}-1, it is essentially zero. The efficiency of
the Blandford-Znajek mechanism in extracting rotational energy from the
black hole is also estimated. In light of these results, the viability
of various gamma-ray burst models is discussed, and the sensitivity of
the results to disk viscosity, black hole rotation rate, and black hole
mass is explored. A diverse range of GRB energies seems unavoidable, and
neutrino annihilation in hyperaccreting black hole systems can explain
bursts of up to 10\^{}52 ergs. Larger energies can be inferred for beaming
systems.

Hamiltonians have a layer with a thickness on the order of tens of
meters, over which the density changes rapidly from that of the normal

the two phases. We also investigate the possibility of dense nucleon
matter having an admixture of quark matter, described using the bag

emerged as a promising method for solving problems in the strong

light-cone quantization of gauge theories from two perspectives: as a
calculational tool for representing hadrons as QCD bound states of
relativistic quarks and gluons, and also as a novel method for
simulating quantum field theory on a computer. The light-cone Fock state
expansion of wavefunctions provides a precise definition of the parton
model and a general calculus for hadronic matrix elements. We present
several new applications of light-cone Fock methods, including
calculations of exclusive weak decays of heavy hadrons, and intrinsic
heavy-quark contributions to structure functions. A general
non-perturbative method for numerically solving quantum field theories,
``discretized light-cone quantization'', is outlined and applied to
several gauge theories. This method is invariant under the large class
of light-cone Lorentz transformations, and it can be formulated such
that ultraviolet regularization is independent of the momentum space
discretization. Both the bound-state spectrum and the corresponding
relativistic light-cone wavefunctions can be obtained by matrix
diagonalization and related techniques. We also discuss the construction

results indicate that the r-modes are unstable due to the emission of
gravitational radiation for all rotating perfect fluid stars. This is
interesting, since the previously considered gravitational wave
instability associated with (for example) the f-mode of the star sets in
at a critical rotation rate. Because they are also unstable for the

Seyfert 1 galaxies and two radio-quiet quasars) and four radio-loud
objects (three broad-line radio galaxies and one radio-loud quasar). A
simple power-law continuum absorbed by Galactic material provides a very
poor description of the spectra of most objects. Deviations from the
power-law form are interpreted in terms of X-ray reprocessing/absorption
processes. In particular, at least half of the objects show K-shell
absorption edges of warm oxygen (Ovii and Oviii) characteristic of
optically thin, photoionized material along the line of sight to the
central engine, the so-called warm absorber. The amount and presence of
this absorption are found to depend on either the luminosity or radio
properties of the objects: luminous and/or radio-loud objects are found
to possess less ionized absorption. This ambiguity exists because the
radio-loud objects are also amongst the most luminous of the sample. It
is also found that objects with significant optical reddening display
deep Ovii edges. The converse is true with two possible exceptions (NGC
3783 and NGC 3516). Coupled with other evidence resulting from detailed
study of particular objects, this suggests the existence of dusty warm
plasma. A radiatively driven outflow originating from the molecular
torus is probably the source of this plasma. Rapid variability of the
warm absorber also points to there being another component closer to the
central source and probably situated within the broad-line region (BLR).
Independent evidence for such an optically thin, highly ionized BLR
component comes from detailed optical/UV studies. Spectral features at
energies characteristic of cold iron Kalpha emission are common. Such
emission is expected to arise from the fluorescence of cold iron in
optically thick material when illuminated by the primary X-ray
continuum. Radio-quiet objects have iron emission well described as
originating either from the inner regions of an accretion disc or, in a
small number of cases, from the molecular torus. Two of the radio-loud
objects (3C 120 and 3C 382) have a much broader feature which presents
problems for the relativistic disc model. The presence of radio jets may
be important in forming this spectral feature.

ultraviolet (UV) bump in low-luminosity objects is thermal emission from
a dense medium, very probably an accretion disk, irradiated by the
variable X-ray source. The validity of this model for high-luminosity
radio-quiet AGN is unclear because the relevant UV and X-ray
observations are lacking. The broad-line gas kinematics appears to be
dominated by virialized motions in the gravity field of a black hole,
whose mass can be derived from the observed motions. The ``accretion
disk plus wind'' model explains most of the variability (and other) data
and appears to be the most appropriate model at present. Future
investigations are outlined. In blazars, rapid variability at the
highest energies (gamma-rays) implies that the whole continuum is
relativistically boosted along the line of sight. The general
correlation found between variations in TeV gamma rays and in X rays for
Mrk 421, and between variations in GeV gamma rays and in the
IR--optical--UV bands for 3C 279, two prototype objects, supports models
in which the same population of relativistic electrons radiates the

Various aspects of QCD related to the dynamical and explicit breaking of

spectra and coupling constants of hadrons, flavor mixing in mesons, the
violation of the OZI rule in baryons, and the validity of the chiral

axial anomaly and the current-quark masses plays important roles, and a
realistic evaluation of the strangeness and heavy quark contents of
hadrons is given. Also the problem of elusive scalar mesons is studied
in detail. For a pedagogical reason, we first present an account of
basic ingredients and detailed technical aspects of the NJL model using
simple versions of it.

In part II, the NJL model is applied to the system at finite temperature
(T) and density ({\rhov}) relevant to the early universe, interior of the
neutron stars and the ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions. After a
brief introduction of the field theory at finite temperature, phenomena
associated with the restoration of chiral symmetry in the medium are
examined. The subjects treated here include the quark condensates in the
medium, meson properties at finite T ({\rhov}) and their experimental
implications. A special attemtion is paid to fluctuation phenomena near
the critical temperature, i.e., possible existence of soft modes in the
scalar channel and a jump of the quark-number susceptibility in the
vector channel.

greater than c. The accepted explanation is that clouds of plasma are
ejected in opposite directions from the central source at speeds close
to (but less than) that of light, and that relativistic effects lead to
the apparent superluminal motion^{2}. But the extreme distance
of the objects observed so far introduces many uncertainties into this

apparent superluminal motion ever detected in a source within our own
Galaxy. The optical, infrared and X-ray properties^{4,5} of the
counterpart suggest that the source is either a neutron star or a black
hole that is ejecting matter in a process similar to, but on a smaller
scale than that seen in quasars. Because of its relative proximity, this
superluminal microquasar may offer the best opportunity to gain a
general understanding of relativistic ejections seen elsewhere in the

B1855+09 at 1.4 GHz, with typical accuracies of about 0.8 micrometers
and for PSR B1937 + 21 at both 1.4 and 2.4 GHz, with accuracies around
0.2 micrometers. The pulse arrival times are fitted to a simple model
for each pulsar, yielding high-precision astrometric, rotational, and
orbital parameters, and a diverse range of conclusions. The celestial
coordinates and proper motions of the two pulsars are determined with
uncertainties less than or equal to 0.12 mas and less than or equal to
0.06 mas/year in the reference frame of the DE200 planetary ephemeris.
The annual parallaxes are found to be pi=1.1 +/- 0.3 mas and pi less
than 0.28 mas for PSRs B1855+09 and B1937+21, respectively. The general
relativistic Shapiro delay is measured in the PSR B1855+09 system and

provides a phenomenological limit on the secular change of Newton's
gravitational constant, dot-G/G=(-9 +/- 18) x 10^{-12}/year.
Variations in the dispersion measure of PSR B1937 + 21 indicate that the
spectrum of electron-density fluctuations in the interstellar medi um
has a power-law index beta = 3.874 +/- 0.011, slightly steeper than the
Kolmogorov value of 11/3, and we find no strong evidence for an 'inner
scale' greater than about 2 x 10^{9}cm. In the residual pulse
arrival times for PSR B1937+21 we have observed small systematic trends
not explained by our deterministic timing model. We discuss a number of
possible causes; although the results are not yet conclusive, the most
straightforward interpretation is that the unmodeled noise (a few
microseconds over 8 yr, or Delta t/T approximately equals
10^{-14} is inherent to the pulsar itself. In the present data
set, PSR B1855+09 exhibits no discernible timing noise. With
conventional assumptions we derive a limit Omega _{g}
h^{2} less than 6 x 10^{-8} (95\% confidence) for the
energy density, per logarithmic frequency interval, in a cosmic
background of stochastic gravitational waves. We discuss the feasibility
of establishing a pulsar-based timescale that might be used to test the
stabilities of the best available atomic clocks. In an Appendix, we

 abstract = "{The stability or lack thereof of nonrelativistic fermionic systems to
interactions is studied within the renormalization-group (RG) framework,
in close analogy with the study of critical phenomena using
{\phis}^{4} scalar field theory. A brief introduction to
{\phis}^{4} theory in four dimensions and the path-integral
formulation for fermions is given before turning to the problem at hand.
As for the latter, the following procedure is used. First, the modes on
either side of the Fermi surface within a cutoff {$\Lambda$} are chosen for
study, in analogy with the modes near the origin in {\phis}^{4}
theory, and a path integral is written to describe them. Next, an RG
transformation that eliminates a part of these modes, but preserves the
action of the noninteracting system, is identified. Finally the possible
perturbations of this free-field fixed point are classified as relevant,
irrelevant or marginal. A d=1 warmup calculation involving a system of
fermions shows how, in contrast to mean-field theory, which predicts a
charge-density wave for arbitrarily weak repulsion, and
superconductivity for arbitrarily weak attraction, the
renormalization-group approach correctly yields a scale-invariant system
(Luttinger liquid) by taking into account both instabilities.
Application of the renormalization group in d=2 and 3, for rotationally
invariant Fermi surfaces, automatically leads to Landau's Fermi-liquid
theory, which appears as a fixed point characterized by an effective
mass and a Landau function F, with the only relevant perturbations being
of the superconducting (BCS) type. The functional flow equations for the
BCS couplings are derived and separated into an infinite number of
flows, one for each angular momentum. It is shown that similar results
hold for rotationally noninvariant (but time-reversal-invariant) Fermi
surfaces also, with obvious loss of rotational invariance in the
parametrization of the fixed-point interactions. A study of a nested
Fermi surface shows an additional relevant flow leading to
charge-density-wave formation. It is pointed out that, for small
{$\Lambda$}K_{F}, a 1N expansion emerges, with
N=K_{F}{$\Lambda$}, which explains why one is able to solve the
narrow-cutoff theory. The search for non-Fermi liquids in d=2 using the
RG is discussed. Bringing a variety of phenomena (Landau theory,
charge-density waves, BCS instability, nesting, etc.) under the one
unifying principle of the RG not only allows us to better understand and
unify them, but also paves the way for generalizations and extensions.
The article is pedagogical in nature and is expected to be accessible to
any serious graduate student. On the other hand, its survey of the vast
literature is mostly limited to the RG approach.

scalar-field dominated to agree with dynamical estimates of the density
parameter, {$\Omega$}_{dyn~0.2}, and zero spatial curvature. The
required scalar-field potential is ``nonlinear'' and decreases in
magnitude as the value of the scalar field increases. A special solution
of the field equations which is an attractive, time-dependent, fixed
point is presented. These models are consistent with the classical tests
of gravitation theory. The E{\"o}tv{\"o}s-Dicke measurements strongly
constrain the coupling of the scalar field to light (nongravitational)
fields. Nucleosynthesis proceeds as in the standard hot big-bang model.
In linear perturbation theory the behavior of baryonic perturbations, in
the baryon-dominated epoch, do not differ significantly from the
canonical scenario, while the presence of a substantial amount of
homogeneous scalar-field energy density at low red-shifts inhibits the
growth of perturbations in the baryonic fluid. The energy density in the
scalar field is not appreciably perturbed by nonrelativistic
gravitational fields, either in the radiation-dominated,
matter-dominated, or scalar-field-dominated epochs. On the basis of this
effect, we argue that these models could reconcile the low dynamical
estimates of the mean mass density with the negligibly small spatial
curvature preferred by inflation.

{$\sigma$}\~{} ^{a} _{A} ^{B} and certain

Einstein's theory simply state that {$\sigma$}\~{} ^{a} satisfies the
Gauss law constraint with respect to A_{a} and that the

satisfies certain purely algebraic conditions (involving {$\sigma$}\~{}

the new variables {$\sigma$}\~{} ^{a} and A_{a}. This is in
striking contrast with the situation with traditional variables, where
constraints contain nonpolynomial functions of the three-metric.
Simplification occurs because A_{a} has information about both
the three-metric and its conjugate momentum. In the four-dimensional
space-time picture, A_{a} turns out to be a potential for the
self-dual part of Weyl curvature. An important feature of the new form
of constraints is that it provides a natural embedding of the constraint
surface of the Einstein phase space into that of Yang-Mills phase space.
This embedding provides new tools to analyze a number of issues in both

    month = apr,

    pages = {255-351},
 abstract = "{Powerful extragalactic radio sources comprise two extended regions
containing magnetic field and synchrotron-emitting relativistic
electrons, each linked by a jet to a central compact radio source
located in the nucleus of the associated galaxy. These jets are
collimated streams of plasma that emerge from the nucleus in opposite
directions, along which flow mass, momentum, energy, and magnetic flux.
Methods of using the observations diagnostically to infer the pressures,
densities, and fluid velocities within jets are explained. The jets
terminate in the extended radio components, where they interact strongly
with the surrounding medium through a combination of shock waves and
instabilities. Jets may expand freely, be confined by external gas
pressure, or be pinched by toroidal magnetic fields. Shear flows are
known to be Kelvin-Helmholtz unstable and thus may be responsible for
some of the observed oscillation of jets about their mean directions and
for creating the turbulence and shock waves needed to accelerate the
relativistic electrons. Larger-scale bending may be caused by changes in
the jet axis within the nucleus, gravitational interaction of the radio
galaxy with a companion galaxy, or rapid motion of the source through
dense intergalactic gas. The compact radio sources also exhibit a jet
morphology and contain more direct clues as to the origins of jets; in
particular, the variations sometimes observed imply bulk flows that are
relativistic. It is widely believed that nuclear activity is ultimately
ascribable to gas accreting onto a massive black hole. The accretion can
proceed in several different fashions, depending upon whether or not the
gas has angular momentum and whether or not the radiation emitted is
sufficiently intense to influence the dynamics of the flow. Several
distinct mechanisms for jet production in the context of black holes
have been proposed. (Alternative mechanisms involving dense star
clusters and massive spinning stars are also reviewed.) Supersonic jets
may be collimated along the spin axis of a gas cloud surrounding the
source of the lighter jet gas. Magnetic fields may be crucial in
collimating jets, especially if they are wrapped around the jet by
orbiting gas and can thereby collimate the outflow through the pinch
effect. In fact, the spin energy of the black hole could also be
extracted by magnetic torques, in which case the jet would contain
electrons and positrons and carry a large electromagnetic Poynting flux.
Statistical investigations of active galaxies also furnish valuable
information on their nature and evolutionary behavior. The formation of
particular kinds of sources appears to be correlated with environmental
effects and cosmic epoch. In addition, the brightest compact radio
sources on the sky, which probably involve relativistic motion, may be
intrinsically faint objects beamed in our direction. There is now
compelling evidence for the continuous fueling of extragalactic radio
sources through jets emerging from the nucleus of the associated galaxy.
The morphological classification of radio sources is interpreted in
terms of the powers, speeds, and surroundings of jets. The ratio of the
mass accretion rate to the mass of the hole may determine whether an
active nucleus will be primarily a thermal object like an optical quasar
or a nonthermal object like a radio galaxy. The authors outline a
unified model of nuclear activity and assess what future progress may
stem from observational developments (especially the proposed very long
baseline array), experimental approaches (such as wind tunnel
simulations), and theoretical studies (in particular, large-scale
numerical hydrodynamical computing).

shown to be characterized by two scales, namely the damping mass and the

that in nonrelativistic ones. For massive neutrinos, both scales are of

consideration of the differences in physics of various groups of atoms
is necessary to achieve pseudopotentials with the most desirable

transferability to various systems. Another is the ability to be fitted
with a small set of analytic functions useful with a variety of
wave-function representations. On the basis of these considerations, a
consistent set of pseudopotentials has been developed for the entire
Periodic Table. Relativistic effects are included in a way that enables
the potentials to be used in nonrelativistic formulations. The scheme
used to generate the numerical potentials, the fitting procedure, and
the testing of the fit are discussed. Representative examples of
potentials are shown that display attributes spanning the set. A
complete tabulation of the fitted potentials is given along with a guide

used to construct the expected number/flux density counts for

good agreement with the observations is obtained if the average core

L_{ξ}{\equiv}1/2{$\xi$}{$\epsilon$}_{μνλ}TrA^{μ}[{\part}^{ν}A^{λ}-2/3igA^{ν}A^{λ}]

A^{μ} belong to a Lie algebra (represented here in terms of
matrices), {$\epsilon$}_{μνλ} is the completely
antisymmetric symbol, the coupling g has units [mass]^{1/2}, and
the parameter {$\xi$} has units [mass]. L_{ξ}, related to the
instanton current of four dimensions, is gauge invariant up to a total
divergence and a topological density. (There is a supersymmetric
extension with the same property.) When technical complications can be
ignored, L_{ξ} provides gauge particles with mass without
breaking local symmetry and without introducing auxiliary fields.
Perturbative analysis of models involving L_{ξ} (collectively
called ``{$\xi$} theories'') is complicated by gauge-non-invariant infrared
singularities in gauge-field propagators. Nevertheless, quantized
abelian {$\xi$}-theories (collectively called ``{$\xi$} QED'') do define
gauge-invariant and infrared-finite scattering in perturbation theory.
The consistency of non-abelian {$\xi$} theories is not yet established. The
physics of non-relativistic charges {$\xi$} QED is, in its gross features,
the same as that of the Aharanov-Bohm effect - the static field of a
point charge is a non-trivial pure gauge at large distances. (We argue
that in spite of the long-range fields, propagation of charges at large
times is free; so that in {$\xi$} QED there should be no unexpected
subtleties in the axiomatic definition of scattering amplitudes.)
Compatibility of gauge invariance and mass in three dimensions is
related to the existence of massive spinning representations of the
Poincar{\'e} algebra with only one polarization per momentum. The
massive spin-one photon of {$\xi$} QED is such a particle. (There is in
fact a massive unitary representation of the three-dimensional
Poincar{\'e} algebra with only one polarization for spin equal to any
real number, integral multiple of one-half or otherwise. It is possible
that particles with such an anomalous spin are present in some field
theories.) L_{ξ} is invariant under the discrete
transformation C but not under T, nor under any reflection P in a single
spatial axis. L_{ξ} is invariant under PCT.

magnitude less than the expected number of neutron stars and black holes
in binary systems. It is shown in the paper that the main condition for
the appearance of X-ray source in a binary system including relativistic
star is that the size of the normal component must be close to size of
its critical Roche lobe. In the case of accretion of the stellar wind
matter in detached binary system the specific angular momentum of the
matter captured by the relativistic star is small. Therefore the
accreting disk is not formed around relativistic star. Consequently, a
black hole in detached binary system can not be strong X-ray source (no
matter how strong the stellar wind might be). In this case the accretion
is spherically-symmetric and black hole is the source of hard X-ray and
y-ray radiation. Young neutron star in detached system is ejecting
pulsar, radiating in X-ray spectral band, like the Crab pulsar. Its
radioemission is absorbed in stellar wind plasma due to free-free
processes. Deceleration of the pulsar rotation and connected decrease of
its luminosity makes possible the penetration of the ambient plasma
inside light cylinder. This may lead to the switching off of the pulsar
mechanism. However rapidly rotating magnetosphere of the neutron star
throws away the falling matter, preventing the accretion. The rotation,
consequently, continues to decelerate. Only after sufficient
deceleration of neutron star rotation the accretion becomes possible and
neutron star will be the X-ray source. However the estimates show that
the deceleration time up to this stage exceeds the evolutionary time of
the normal component. Only in the extremely close binaries having
anomalously strong accreting matter flow it is possible for the
magnetized neutron star to convert into the X-ray sources. For the same
reason old single pulsars with strong magnetic field never become the
sources of ultra-violet and soft X-ray radiation. Key words: black holes
and neutron stars accretion X-ray sources pulsars

approximations of a very short photon mean free path before plasma
recombination, and a very long mean free path after, are inadequate. We
present here results of the direct integration of the collision equation

the complicated regime of plasma recombination. Starting from an assumed
initial power spectrum well before recombination, we obtain a final
spectrum of density perturbations after recombination. The calculations
are carried out for several general-relativity models and one
scalar-tensor model. One can identify two characteristic masses in the
final power spectrum: one is the mass within the Hubble radius ct at
recombination, and the other results from the linear dissipation of the
perturbations prior to recombination. Conceivably the first of these
numbers is associated with the great rich clusters of galaxies, the
second with the large galaxies. We compute also the expected residual
irregularity in the radiation from the primeval fireball. If we assume
that (1) the rich clusters formed from an initially adiabatic
perturbation and (2) the fireball radiation has not been seriously
perturbed after the epoch of recombination of the primeval plasma, then
with an angular resolution of t minute of arc the rms fluctuation in

 abstract = "{We present in this paper the initial installment of a quantitative
exploration of one particular pulsar model. We first make plausible and
then assume that the seat of the pulsar phenomenon is a rotating neutron
star having a dipolar magnetic field which is not parallel to the
rotation axis. We then show that such stars may be expected to emit
large amounts (1050\_1052 ergs) of magnetic-dipole and gravitational-
quadrupole radiation, that these energy losses are inevitably associated
with losses of angular momentum and increases in the rotation periods,
and that the emitted low-frequency magnetic-dipole radiation is
extremely efficient at accelerating charged particles to relativistic
energies. An explicit expression for the period as a function of time
allows us to calculate the age of the Crab Nebula (with 20 percent
accuracy) and to predict the so far unobserved second derivative of the
period (d2P/dt2). We also de- termine the luminosity of the nebula and
the highest-energy electrons presently being injected into it- both
numbers found to be in good agreement with independent observations. In
extreme cases the ac- celeration mechanism can produce protons with
energies up to m\~{}c2(e2/Gm\~{})'/3 or 1021 eV, which is somewhat in excess
of the most energetic cosmic rays yet observed. The theory predicts a
relation be- tween period, F, and rate of change of period, dP/dt 3 X
10'5/P(sec), which is well observed, in the mean, for pulsars. Finally,
after determining the magnetic decay time to be about 4 million years,
we predict that few pulsars should be found with periods in excess of
1.5 seconds, also in good accord with observations. We do not discuss
the origin of the pulses themselves

 abstract = "{Spin-0 fields of arbitrary mass and massless fields of arbitrary spin
are considered. The equations governing the fields are the covariant
generalizations of the special-relativistic free-field equations. The
metric, which is not quantized, is that of a universe with an expanding
(or contracting) Euclidean 3-space. The spin-0 field of arbitrary mass
is quantized in the expanding universe by the canonical procedure. The
quantization is consistent with the time development dictated by the
equation of motion only when the boson commutation relations are
imposed. This consistency requirement provides a new proof of the
connection between spin and statistics. We show that the particle number
is an adiabatic invariant, but not a strict constant of the motion. We
obtain an expression for the average particle density as a function of
the time, and show that particle creation occurs in pairs. The canonical
creation and annihilation operators corresponding to physical particles
during the expansion are specified. Thus, we do not use an S-matrix
approach. We show that in a universe with flat 3-space containing only
massless particles in equilibrium, there will be precisely no creation
of massless particles as a result of the expansion, provided the
Einstein field equations without the cosmological term are correct.
Furthermore, in a dust-filled universe with flat 3-space there will be
precisely no creation of massive spin-0 particles in the limit of
infinite mass, again provided that the Einstein field equations are
correct. Conversely, without assuming any particular equations, such as
the Einstein equations, as governing the expansion of the universe, we
obtain the familiar Friedmann expansions for the radiation-filled and
the dust-filled universes with flat 3-space. We only make a very general
and natural hypothesis connecting the particle creation rate with the
macroscopic expansion of the universe. In one derivation, we assume that
in an expansion of the universe in which a particular type of particle
is predominant, the type of expansion approached after a long time will
be such as to minimize the average creation rate of that particle. In
another derivation, we use the assumption that the reaction of the
particle creation back on the gravitational field will modify the
expansion in such a way as to reduce, if possible, the creation rate.
This connection between the particle creation and the Einstein equations
is surprising because the Einstein equations themselves played no part
at all in the derivation of the equations governing the particle
creation. Finally, on the basis of a so-called infinite-mass
approximation, we argue that in the present predominantly dust-filled
universe, only massless particles of zero spin might possibly be
produced in significant amounts by the present expansion. In this
connection, we show that massless particles of arbitrary nonzero spin,
such as photons or gravitons, are not created by the expansion,
regardless of its form.

the number of massless particles in a theory of this type is determined,
and the possibility of having a broken non-Abelian gauge symmetry with
no massless particles whatever is established. A secondary purpose is to
investigate the relationship between the radiation-gauge and
Lorentz-gauge formalisms. The Abelian-gauge case is reexamined, in order
to show that, contrary to some previous assertions, the Lorentz-gauge
formalism, properly handled, is perfectly consistent, and leads to
physical conclusions identical with those reached using the radiation

systems to obtain a practical theory of three-particle states. Each of
the two-particle subsystems is assumed to be dominated by a finite
number of bound states and resonances. We then obtain two sets of
equations. One expresses processes with three final particles in terms
of unstable-particle scattering. It generalizes and justifies the isobar
model. The other is a set of coupled Lippmann-Schwinger equations for
the scattering of bound states and unstable particles. The potentials in
these scattering equations for composite particles are nonlocal and
energy-dependent, and become complex above the three-particle threshold.
They are expressed in terms of the wave functions of the two-particle
bound states and resonances-there are no new arbitrary constants. The
solution satisfies three-particle unitarity. Unstable particles are not
approximated by stable ones. The theory applies especially to
''overlapping'' final-state interactions. The equations are given in
detail for the 3N and N{$\pi$}{$\pi$} systems in the static limit. In the
latter case, the nucleon is treated as an N{$\pi$} bound state. The
N{$\pi$}{$\pi$} equations are solved approximately in closed form, giving
analogs of the Chew-Low effective-range formula, for the coupled N{$\pi$}
and N^{*}{$\pi$} systems. This predicts large inelasticity in the
P_{11} state, in agreement with experiment. Detailed solutions
will be given in subsequent papers. If all elementary particles are
treated as bound states of themselves, our approach gives the basis of a
complete dynamical theory of strong interactions.

400 extragalactic nebulae for which Holetschek has determined total
visual magnitudes. The list is complete for the brighter nebulae in the
northern sky and is representative to 12.5 mag. or fainter. The
classification employed is based on the forms of the photographic
images. About 3 per cent are irregular, but the remaining nebulae fall
into a sequence of type forms characterized by rotational symmetry about
dominating nuclei. The sequence is composed of two sections, the
elliptical nebulae and the spirals, which merge into each other.
Luminosity relations. - The distribution of magnitudes appears to be
uniform throughout the sequence. For each type or stage in the sequence,
the total magnitudes are related to the logarithms of the maximum
diameters by the formula, m_{T} = C - 5 log d, where C varies
progressively from type to type, indicating a variation in diameter for
a given magnitude or vice versa. By applying corrections to C, the
nebulae can be reduced to a standard type and then a single formula
expresses the relation for all nebulae from the Magellanic Clouds to the
faintest that can be classified. When the minor diameter is used, the
value of C is approximately constant throughout the entire sequence. The
coefficient of log d corresponds with the inverse-square law, which
suggests that the nebulae are all of the same order of absolute
luminosity and that apparent magnitudes are measures of distance. This
hypothesis is supported by similar results for the nuclear magnitudes
and the magnitudes of the brightest stars involved, and by the small
range in luminosities among nebulae whose distances are already known.
Distances and absolute dimensions. - The mean absolute visual magnitude,
as derived from the nebulae whose distances are known, is -15.2. The
statistical expression for the distance in parsecs is then log D = 4.04
+ 0.2 m_{T}. where m_{T} is the total apparent
magnitude. This leads to mean values for absolute dimensions at various
stages in the sequence of types. Masses appear to be of the order of
2.6x10^{8} M_{sun}. Distribution and density of space. -
To apparent magnitude about 16.7, corresponding to an exposure of one
hour on fast plates with the 60-inch reflector, the numbers of nebulae
to various limits of total magnitude vary directly with the volumes of
space represented by the limits. This indicates an approximately uniform
density of space, of the order of one nebula per 10^{17} cubic
parsecs or 1.5x10^{-31} in C.G.S. units. The corresponding
radius of curvature of the finite universe of general relativity is of
the order of 2.7x10^{10} parsecs, or about 600 times the
distance at which normal nebulae can be detected with the 100-inch
reflector.

of neutron star masses, however, has hitherto been too narrow to rule

delay is a general-relativistic increase in light travel time through
the curved space-time near a massive body. For highly inclined (nearly
edge-on) binary millisecond radio pulsar systems, this effect allows us
to infer the masses of both the neutron star and its binary companion to
high precision. Here we present radio timing observations of the binary
millisecond pulsar J1614-2230 that show a strong Shapiro delay
signature. We calculate the pulsar mass to be
(1.97+/-0.04)M_{solar}, which rules out almost all currently
proposed hyperon or boson condensate equations of state

also use strong lensing clusters to identify a population of very low
luminosity, high-redshift dropout galaxies. We correct the observed
distributions for both selection biases and photometric scatter. We find
that the UV-continuum slope of the most luminous galaxies is
substantially redder at z \~{} 2-4 than it is at z \~{} 5-6 (from \~{}-2.4
at z \~{} 6 to \~{}-1.5 at z \~{} 2). Lower luminosity galaxies are also
found to be bluer than higher luminosity galaxies at z \~{} 2.5 and z \~{} 4.
We do not find a large number of galaxies with {$\beta$}'s as red as
-1 in our dropout selections at z \~{} 4, and particularly at z gsim
5, even though such sources could be readily selected from our data (and
also from Balmer Break Galaxy searches at z \~{} 4). This suggests that
star-forming galaxies at z gsim 5 almost universally have very blue
UV-continuum slopes, and that there are not likely to be a substantial
number of dust-obscured galaxies at z gsim 5 that are missed in
''dropout'' searches. Using the same relation between UV-continuum slope
and dust extinction as has been found to be appropriate at both z \~{} 0
and z \~{} 2, we estimate the average dust extinction of galaxies as a
function of redshift and UV luminosity in a consistent way. As expected,
we find that the estimated dust extinction increases substantially with
cosmic time for the most UV luminous galaxies, but remains small (lsim2
times) at all times for lower luminosity galaxies. Because these same
lower luminosity galaxies dominate the luminosity density in the UV
continuum, the overall dust extinction correction remains modest at all
redshifts and the evolution of this correction with redshift is only
modest. We include the contribution from ultra-luminous IR galaxies in
our SFR density estimates at z \~{} 2-6, but find that they contribute only
\~{}20\% of the total at z \~{} 2.5 and lsim10\% at z gsim 4.

with results from our FLAMES/UVES spectra and from previous studies
within the project, we obtained a total sample of 1958 stars in 19
clusters, the largest and most homogeneous database of this kind to
date. The programme clusters cover a range in metallicity from [Fe/H] =
-2.4 dex to [Fe/H] = -0.4 dex, with a wide variety of global parameters
(morphology of the horizontal branch, mass, concentration, etc.). For
all clusters we find the Na-O anticorrelation, the classical signature
of the operation of proton-capture reactions in H-burning at high
temperature in a previous generation of more massive stars that are now
extinct. Using quantitative criteria (from the morphology and extension
of the Na-O anticorrelation), we can define three different components
of the stellar population in GCs. We separate a primordial component (P)
of first-generation stars, and two components of second-generation
stars, that we name intermediate (I) and extreme (E) populations from
their different chemical composition. The P component is present in all
clusters, and its fraction is almost constant at about one third. The I
component represents the bulk of the cluster population. On the other
hand, E component is not present in all clusters, and it is more
conspicuous in some (but not in all) of the most massive clusters. We
discuss the fractions and spatial distributions of these components in
our sample and in two additional clusters (M 3 = NGC 5272 and M 13 =
NGC6205) with large sets of stars analysed in the literature. We also
find that the slope of the anti-correlation (defined by the minimum O
and maximum Na abundances) changes from cluster-to-cluster, a change
that is represented well by a bilinear relation on cluster metallicity
and luminosity. This second dependence suggests a correlation between
average mass of polluters and cluster mass.

Survey-Chandra Deep Field South surveys, all having very high-quality
optical to mid-infrared data. This sample, unique in that it combines
data from surveys with a large range of depths and areas in a
self-consistent way, allowed us to (1) minimize the uncertainty due to
cosmic variance and empirically quantify its contribution to the total
error budget; (2) simultaneously probe the high-mass end and the
low-mass end (down to \~{}0.05 times the characteristic stellar mass) of
the SMF with good statistics; and (3) empirically derive the
redshift-dependent completeness limits in stellar mass. We provide, for
the first time, a comprehensive analysis of random and systematic
uncertainties affecting the derived SMFs, including the effect of
metallicity, extinction law, stellar population synthesis model, and
initial mass function. We find that the mass density evolves by a factor
of \~{}17^{+7} _{-10} since z = 4.0, mostly driven by
a change in the normalization {$\Phi$}^{sstarf}. If only random
errors are taken into account, we find evidence for mass-dependent
evolution, with the low-mass end evolving more rapidly than the
high-mass end. However, we show that this result is no longer robust
when systematic uncertainties due to the SED-modeling assumptions are
taken into account. Another significant uncertainty is the contribution
to the overall stellar mass density of galaxies below our mass limit;
future studies with WFC3 will provide better constraints on the SMF at
masses below 10^{10} M _{sun} at z{\gt}2. Taking our
results at face value, we find that they are in conflict with
semianalytic models of galaxy formation. The models predict SMFs that
are in general too steep, with too many low-mass galaxies and too few
high-mass galaxies. The discrepancy at the high-mass end is susceptible
to uncertainties in the models and the data, but the discrepancy at the
low-mass end may be more difficult to explain.

several spiral arms. The Perseus spiral arm has a pitch angle of 16{\deg}
{\plusmn} 3{\deg}, which favors four rather than two spiral arms for the
Galaxy. Combining positions, distances, proper motions, and radial
velocities yields complete three-dimensional kinematic information. We
find that star-forming regions on average are orbiting the Galaxy {\ap}15

fitting the measurements to a model of the Galaxy, we estimate the

{$\Theta$}_{0}/R _{0} can be determined to higher accuracy

0.9 km s^{-1} kpc^{-1}, in good
agreement with the angular rotation rate determined from the proper
motion of Sgr A*. The data favor a rotation curve for the Galaxy
that is nearly flat or slightly rising with Galactocentric distance.
Kinematic distances are generally too large, sometimes by factors
greater than 2; they can be brought into better agreement with the
trigonometric parallaxes by increasing {$\Theta$}_{0}/R

s^{-1} kpc^{-1} to a value near
30 km s^{-1} kpc^{-1}. We offer a
''revised'' prescription for calculating kinematic distances and their
uncertainties, as well as a new approach for defining Galactic

{$\Theta$}_{0}/R _{0}, when coupled with direct estimates
of R _{0}, provide evidence that the rotation curve of the Milky

matter halos of these two dominant Local Group galaxy are comparably
massive.

histories of galaxies are now commonly estimated via stellar population
synthesis (SPS) techniques. SPS relies on stellar evolution calculations
from the main sequence to stellar death, stellar spectral libraries,
phenomenological dust models, and stellar initial mass functions (IMFs)
to translate the evolution of a multimetallicity, multi-age set of stars
into a prediction for the time-evolution of the integrated light from
that set of stars. Each of these necessary inputs carries significant
uncertainties that have until now received little systematic attention.
The present work is the first in a series that explores the impact of
uncertainties in key phases of stellar evolution and the IMF on the
derived physical properties of galaxies and the expected luminosity
evolution for a passively evolving set of stars. A Monte Carlo Markov
Chain approach is taken to fit near-UV through near-IR photometry of a
representative sample of low- and high-redshift galaxies with this new
SPS model. Significant results include the following. (1) Including
uncertainties in stellar evolution, stellar masses at z \~{} 0 carry errors
of \~{}0.3 dex at 95\% CL with little dependence on luminosity or color,
while at z \~{} 2, the masses of bright red galaxies are uncertain at the
\~{}0.6 dex level. (2) Either current stellar evolution models, current
observational stellar libraries, or both, do not adequately characterize
the metallicity-dependence of the thermally pulsating AGB phase. (3)
Conservative estimates on the uncertainty of the slope of the IMF in the
solar neighborhood imply that luminosity evolution per unit redshift is
uncertain at the \~{}0.4 mag level in the K band, which is a substantial
source of uncertainty for interpreting the evolution of galaxy
populations across time. Any possible evolution in the IMF, as suggested
by several independent lines of evidence, will only exacerbate this
problem. (4) Assuming a distribution of stellar metallicities within a
galaxy, rather than a fixed value as is usually assumed, can yield
important differences when considering bands blueward of V, but is not a
concern for redder bands. Spectroscopic information may alleviate some
of these concerns, though uncertainties in the stellar spectral
libraries and the importance of nonsolar abundance ratios have not yet
been systematically investigated in the SPS context.

supernova (SN) progenitor stars. In doing so we compile all SNe

and determine the relative rates of each subtype from literature
studies. The core-collapse SNe break down into 59 per cent II-P and 29
per cent Ib/c, with the remainder being IIb (5 per cent), IIn (4 per
cent) and II-L (3 per cent). There have been 20 II-P SNe with
high-quality optical or near-infrared pre-explosion images that allow a
meaningful search for the progenitor stars. In five cases they are
clearly red supergiants, one case is unconstrained, two fall on compact
coeval star clusters and the other twelve have no progenitor detected.
We review and update all the available data for the host galaxies and SN
environments (distance, metallicity and extinction) and determine masses
and upper mass estimates for these 20 progenitor stars using the STARS
stellar evolutionary code and a single consistent homogeneous method. A
maximum likelihood calculation suggests that the minimum stellar mass
for a Type II-P to form is m_{min} =
8.5^{+1}_{-1.5}M_{solar} and the maximum mass
for II-P progenitors is m_{max} = 16.5 +/- 1.5M_{solar},
assuming a Salpeter initial mass function holds for the progenitor
population (in the range {$\Gamma$} = -1.35^{+0.3}_{-0.7}).
The minimum mass is consistent with current estimates for the upper
limit to white dwarf progenitor masses, but the maximum mass does not
appear consistent with massive star populations in Local Group galaxies.
Red supergiants in the Local Group have masses up to 25M_{solar}
and the minimum mass to produce a Wolf-Rayet star in single star
evolution (between solar and LMC metallicity) is similarly
25-30M_{solar}. The reason we have not detected any high-mass
red supergiant progenitors above 17M_{solar} is unclear, but we
estimate that it is statistically significant at 2.4{$\sigma$} confidence.
Two simple reasons for this could be that we have systematically
underestimated the progenitor masses due to dust extinction or that
stars between 17-25M_{solar} produce other kinds of SNe which
are not II-P. We discuss these possibilities and find that neither
provides a satisfactory solution. We term this discrepancy the `red
supergiant problem' and speculate that these stars could have core
masses high enough to form black holes and SNe which are too faint to
have been detected. We compare the ^{56}Ni masses ejected in the
SNe to the progenitor mass estimates and find that low-luminosity SNe
with low ^{56}Ni production are most likely to arise from
explosions of low-mass progenitors near the mass threshold that can
produce a core-collapse.

how halo masses, galaxy stellar masses, and star formation rates are
related, and how these relations evolve with time. The relation between
halo mass and galaxy stellar mass is determined by matching the observed
spatial abundance of galaxies to the expected spatial abundance of halos
at multiple epochs, i.e., more massive galaxies are assigned to more
massive halos at each epoch. This ''abundance matching'' technique has
been shown previously to reproduce the observed luminosity and scale
dependence of galaxy clustering over a range of epochs. Halos at
different epochs are connected by halo mass accretion histories
estimated from N-body simulations. The halo-galaxy connection at fixed
epochs in conjunction with the connection between halos across time
provides a connection between observed galaxies across time. With
approximations for the impact of merging and accretion on the growth of
galaxies, one can then directly infer the star formation histories of
galaxies as a function of stellar and halo mass. This model is tuned to
match both the observed evolution of the stellar mass function and the
normalization of the observed star formation rate (SFR)-stellar mass
relation to z \~{} 1. The data demands, for example, that the star
formation rate density is dominated by galaxies with M _{star}
{\ap} 10^{10.0-10.5} M _{sun} from 0 {\lt} z {\lt} 1, and
that such galaxies over these epochs reside in halos with M
_{vir} {\ap} 10^{11.5-12.5} M _{sun}. The
SFR-halo mass relation is approximately Gaussian over the range 0 {\lt} z
{\lt} 1 with a mildly evolving mean and normalization. This model is then
used to shed light on a number of issues, including (1) a clarification
of ''downsizing'', (2) the lack of a sharp characteristic halo mass at
which star formation is truncated, and (3) the dominance of star
formation over merging to the stellar buildup of galaxies with M

IRAC and MIPS instruments for five large, nearby molecular clouds. Three
of the clouds were also mapped in dust continuum emission at 1.1 mm, and
optical spectroscopy has been obtained for some clouds. This paper
combines information drawn from studies of individual clouds into a
combined and updated statistical analysis of star-formation rates and
efficiencies, numbers and lifetimes for spectral energy distribution
(SED) classes, and clustering properties. Current star-formation
efficiencies range from 3\% to 6\%; if star formation continues at current
rates for 10 Myr, efficiencies could reach 15-30\%. Star-formation rates
and rates per unit area vary from cloud to cloud; taken together, the
five clouds are producing about 260 M _{sun} of stars per Myr.
The star-formation surface density is more than an order of magnitude
larger than would be predicted from the Kennicutt relation used in
extragalactic studies, reflecting the fact that those relations apply to
larger scales, where more diffuse matter is included in the gas surface
density. Measured against the dense gas probed by the maps of dust
continuum emission, the efficiencies are much higher, with stellar
masses similar to masses of dense gas, and the current stock of dense
cores would be exhausted in 1.8 Myr on average. Nonetheless, star
formation is still slow compared to that expected in a free-fall time,
even in the dense cores. The derived lifetime for the Class I phase is
0.54 Myr, considerably longer than some estimates. Similarly, the
lifetime for the Class 0 SED class, 0.16 Myr, with the notable exception
of the Ophiuchus cloud, is longer than early estimates. If photometry is
corrected for estimated extinction before calculating class indicators,
the lifetimes drop to 0.44 Myr for Class I and to 0.10 for Class 0.
These lifetimes assume a continuous flow through the Class II phase and
should be considered median lifetimes or half-lives. Star formation is
highly concentrated to regions of high extinction, and the youngest
objects are very strongly associated with dense cores. The great
majority (90\%) of young stars lie within loose clusters with at least 35
members and a stellar density of 1 M _{sun}
pc^{-3}. Accretion at the sound speed from an isothermal
sphere over the lifetime derived for the Class I phase could build a
star of about 0.25 M _{sun}, given an efficiency of 0.3.
Building larger mass stars by using higher mass accretion rates could be
problematic, as our data confirm and aggravate the ''luminosity problem''
for protostars. At a given T _{bol}, the values for L
_{bol} are mostly less than predicted by standard infall models
and scatter over several orders of magnitude. These results strongly
suggest that accretion is time variable, with prolonged periods of very
low accretion. Based on a very simple model and this sample of sources,
half the mass of a star would be accreted during only 7\% of the Class I
lifetime, as represented by the eight most luminous objects.

 abstract = "{We review and discuss horizontal branch (HB) stars in a broad
astrophysical context, including both variable and non-variable stars. A
reassessment of the Oosterhoff dichotomy is presented, which provides
unprecedented detail regarding its origin and systematics. We show that
the Oosterhoff dichotomy and the distribution of globular clusters in
the HB morphology-metallicity plane both exclude, with high statistical
significance, the possibility that the Galactic halo may have formed
from the accretion of dwarf galaxies resembling present-day Milky Way
satellites such as Fornax, Sagittarius, and the LMC{\mdash}an argument
which, due to its strong reliance on the ancient RR Lyrae stars, is
essentially independent of the chemical evolution of these systems after
the very earliest epochs in the Galaxy{\rsquo}s history. Convenient
analytical fits to isochrones in the HB type-[Fe/H] plane are also
provided. In this sense, a rediscussion of the second-parameter problem
is also presented, focusing on the cases of NGC 288/NGC 362, M13/M3, the
extreme outer-halo globular clusters with predominantly red HBs, and the
metal-rich globular clusters NGC 6388 and NGC 6441. The recently revived
possibility that the helium abundance may play an important role as a
second parameter is also addressed, and possible constraints on this
scenario discussed. We critically discuss the possibility that the
observed properties of HB stars in NGC 6388 and NGC 6441 might be
accounted for if these clusters possess a relatively minor population of
helium-enriched stars. A technique is proposed to estimate the HB types
of extragalactic globular clusters on the basis of integrated far-UV
photometry. The importance of bright type II Cepheids as tracers of
faint blue HB stars in distant systems is also emphasized. The
relationship between the absolute V magnitude of the HB at the RR Lyrae
level and metallicity, as obtained on the basis of trigonometric
parallax measurements for the star RR Lyr, is also revisited. Taking
into due account the evolutionary status of RR Lyr, the derived relation
implies a true distance modulus to the LMC of
(m-M)_{0}=18.44{\plusmn}0.11. Techniques providing
discrepant slopes and zero points for the M _{ V
}(RRL)-[Fe/H] relation are briefly discussed. We provide a
convenient analytical fit to theoretical model predictions for the
period change rates of RR Lyrae stars in globular clusters, and compare
the model results with the available data. Finally, the conductive
opacities used in evolutionary calculations of low-mass stars are also
investigated.

measured by the dE/dx method in the STAR (solenoidal tracker at the BNL
Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider) time projection chamber are reported
for pp and d+Au collisions at s_{NN}=200 GeV and for Au+Au
collisions at 62.4, 130, and 200 GeV. Average transverse momenta, total
particle production, particle yield ratios, strangeness, and baryon
production rates are investigated as a function of the collision system
and centrality. The transverse momentum spectra are found to be flatter
for heavy particles than for light particles in all collision systems;
the effect is more prominent for more central collisions. The extracted
average transverse momentum of each particle species follows a trend
determined by the total charged-particle multiplicity density. The
Bjorken energy density estimate is at least several GeV/fm^{3}
for a formation time less than 1 fm/c. A significantly larger net-baryon
density and a stronger increase of the net-baryon density with
centrality are found in Au+Au collisions at 62.4 GeV than at the two
higher energies. Antibaryon production relative to total particle
multiplicity is found to be constant over centrality, but increases with
the collision energy. Strangeness production relative to total particle
multiplicity is similar at the three measured RHIC energies. Relative
strangeness production increases quickly with centrality in peripheral
Au+Au collisions, to a value about 50\% above the pp value, and remains
rather constant in more central collisions. Bulk freeze-out properties
are extracted from thermal equilibrium model and hydrodynamics-motivated
blast-wave model fits to the data. Resonance decays are found to have
little effect on the extracted kinetic freeze-out parameters because of
the transverse momentum range of our measurements. The extracted
chemical freeze-out temperature is constant, independent of collision
system or centrality; its value is close to the predicted
phase-transition temperature, suggesting that chemical freeze-out
happens in the vicinity of hadronization and the chemical freeze-out
temperature is universal despite the vastly different initial conditions
in the collision systems. The extracted kinetic freeze-out temperature,
while similar to the chemical freeze-out temperature in pp, d+Au, and
peripheral Au+Au collisions, drops significantly with centrality in
Au+Au collisions, whereas the extracted transverse radial flow velocity
increases rapidly with centrality. There appears to be a prolonged
period of particle elastic scatterings from chemical to kinetic
freeze-out in central Au+Au collisions. The bulk properties extracted at
chemical and kinetic freeze-out are observed to evolve smoothly over the
measured energy range, collision systems, and collision centralities.

(reaching \~{}3 mJy at 70 {$\mu$}m) obtained with Spitzer in the Great
Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS) and Far Infrared Deep
Extragalactic Legacy survey (FIDEL) fields to derive the evolution of
the rest-frame 15 {$\mu$}m, 35 {$\mu$}m, and total infrared luminosity
functions of galaxies spanning z{\lt}1.3. We thereby quantify the
fractional contribution of infrared luminous galaxies to the comoving
star formation rate density over this redshift range. In comparison with
previous studies, the present one takes advantage of deep 70 {$\mu$}m
observations that provide a more robust infrared luminosity indicator
than 24 {$\mu$}m affected by the emission of PAHs at high redshift
(z{\tilde}1), and we use several independent fields to control cosmic
variance.  <BR />Methods: We used a new extraction technique based on
the well-determined positions of galaxies at shorter wavelengths to
extract the 24 and 70 {$\mu$}m flux densities of galaxies. It is found that
sources separated by a minimum of 0.5 {\times} FWHM are deblended by this
technique, which facilitates multi-wavelength associations of
counterparts. Using a combination of photometric and spectroscopic
redshifts that exist for \~{}80\% of the sources in our sample, we are able
to estimate the rest-frame luminosities of galaxies at 15 {$\mu$}m and 35
{$\mu$}m. By complementing direct detections with a careful stacking
analysis, we measured the mid- and far-infrared luminosity functions of
galaxies over a factor \~{}100 in luminosity
(10^{11}\~{}L_{ȯ} {\lt}{\tilde} L\_IR {\lt}{\tilde}
10^{13}\~{}L_{ȯ}) at z{\lt}1.3. A stacking analysis was
performed to validate the bolometric corrections and to compute comoving
star-formation rate densities in three redshift bins 0.4{\lt}z{\lt}0.7,
0.7{\lt}z{\lt}1.0 and, 1.0{\lt}z{\lt}1.3.  <BR />Results: We find that the
average infrared spectral energy distribution of galaxies over the last
2/3 of the cosmic time is consistent with that of local galaxies,
although individual sources do present significant scatter. We also
measured both the bright and faint ends of the infrared luminosity
functions and find no evidence for a change in the slope of the double
power law used to characterize the luminosity function. The redshift
evolution of infrared luminous galaxies is consistent with pure
luminosity evolution proportional to (1+z)^{3.6±0.4} up
to z{\tilde}1.3. We do not find evidence of differential evolution
between LIRGs and ULIRGs up to z{\tilde}1.3, in contrast with previous
claims. The comoving number density of infrared luminous galaxies has
increased by a factor of {\tilde}100 between 0{\lt}z{\lt}1. By z{\tilde}1.0,
LIRGs produce half of the total comoving infrared luminosity density.

{\lt}= 3.4. Our sample includes {\gt}2000 spectroscopic redshifts and
{\ap}31000 LBGs in 31 spatially independent fields over a total area of
3261 arcmin^{2}. These data allow us to select galaxies to
0.07L* and 0.10L* at z \~{} 2 and z \~{} 3, respectively. A maximum-likelihood
analysis indicates steep values of {$\alpha$}(z = 2) = -1.73 {\plusmn}
0.07 and {$\alpha$}(z = 3) = -1.73 {\plusmn} 0.13. This result is
robust to luminosity-dependent systematics in the Ly{$\alpha$} equivalent
width and reddening distributions, and is similar to the steep values
advocated at z gsim 4, and implies that {\ap}93\% of the unobscured UV
luminosity density at z \~{} 2-3 arises from sub-L* galaxies. With a
realistic luminosity-dependent reddening distribution, faint to
moderately luminous galaxies account for gsim70\% and gsim25\% of the
bolometric luminosity density and present-day stellar mass density,
respectively, when integrated over 1.9 {\lt}= z {\lt} 3.4. We find a
factor of 8-9 increase in the star-formation rate density between z \~{} 6
and z \~{} 2, due to both a brightening of L* and an increasing dust
correction proceeding to lower redshifts. Combining the UV LF with
stellar mass estimates suggests a relatively steep low-mass slope of the
stellar mass function at high redshift. The previously observed
discrepancy between the integral of the star-formation history and
stellar mass density measurements at z \~{} 2 may be reconciled by invoking
a luminosity-dependent reddening correction to the star-formation
history combined with an accounting for the stellar mass contributed by
UV-faint galaxies. The steep and relatively constant faint-end slope of
the UV LF at z gsim 2 contrasts with the shallower slope inferred
locally, suggesting that the evolution in the faint-end slope may be
dictated simply by the availability of low-mass halos capable of
supporting star formation at z lsim 2.

formation rate surface density, {$\Sigma$}_{SFR}, and gas surface
density, {$\Sigma$}_{gas}, at sub-kpc resolution in a sample of 18
nearby galaxies. We use high-resolution H I data from The H I Nearby
Galaxy Survey, CO data from HERACLES and the BIMA Survey of Nearby
Galaxies, 24 {$\mu$}m data from the Spitzer Space Telescope, and UV data
from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer. We target seven spiral galaxies and
11 late-type/dwarf galaxies and investigate how the star formation law
differs between the H_{2} dominated centers of spiral galaxies,
their H I dominated outskirts and the H I rich late-type/dwarf galaxies.
We find that a Schmidt-type power law with index N = 1.0 {\plusmn} 0.2
relates {$\Sigma$}_{SFR} and {$\Sigma$}_{H2} across our sample
of spiral galaxies, i.e., that H_{2} forms stars at a constant
efficiency in spirals. The average molecular gas depletion time is \~{}2
{\times} 10^{9} years. The range of {$\Sigma$}_{H2} over
which we measure this relation is \~{}3-50 M _{sun}
pc^{-2}, significantly lower than in starburst
environments. We find the same results when performing a pixel-by-pixel
analysis, averaging in radial bins, or when varying the star formation
tracer used. We interpret the linear relation and constant depletion
time as evidence that stars are forming in giant molecular clouds with
approximately uniform properties and that {$\Sigma$}_{H2} may be
more a measure of the filling fraction of giant molecular clouds than
changing conditions in the molecular gas. The relationship between total
gas surface density ({$\Sigma$}_{gas}) and {$\Sigma$}_{SFR}
varies dramatically among and within spiral galaxies. Most galaxies show
little or no correlation between {$\Sigma$}_{HI} and
{$\Sigma$}_{SFR}. As a result, the star formation efficiency (SFE),
{$\Sigma$}_{SFR}/{$\Sigma$}_{gas}, varies strongly across our
sample and within individual galaxies. We show that this variation is
systematic and consistent with the SFE being set by local environmental
factors: in spirals the SFE is a clear function of radius, while the
dwarf galaxies in our sample display SFEs similar to those found in the
outer optical disks of the spirals. We attribute the similarity to
common environments (low density, low metallicity, H I dominated) and
argue that shear (which is typically absent in dwarfs) cannot drive the
SFE. In addition to a molecular Schmidt law, the other general feature
of our sample is a sharp saturation of H I surface densities at
{$\Sigma$}_{HI} {\ap} 9 M _{sun} pc^{-2} in
both the spiral and dwarf galaxies. In the case of the spirals, we
observe gas in excess of this limit to be molecular.

function of the free fall and orbital timescales, midplane gas pressure,
stability of the gas disk to collapse (including the effects of stars),
the ability of perturbations to grow despite shear, and the ability of a
cold phase to form. In spirals, the SFE of H_{2} alone is nearly
constant at (5.25 {\plusmn} 2.5) {\times} 10^{-10}

H I, however, the SFE decreases with increasing radius in both spiral

with scale length 0.2r _{25}-0.25r _{25}. We interpret
this decline as a strong dependence of giant molecular cloud (GMC)
formation on environment. The ratio of molecular-to-atomic gas appears
to be a smooth function of radius, stellar surface density, and pressure
spanning from the H_{2}-dominated to H I-dominated ISM. The
radial decline in SFE is too steep to be reproduced only by increases in
the free-fall time or orbital time. Thresholds for large-scale
instability suggest that our disks are stable or marginally stable and
do not show a clear link to the declining SFE. We suggest that ISM
physics below the scales that we observe{\mdash}phase balance in the H I,
H_{2} formation and destruction, and stellar
feedback{\mdash}governs the formation of GMCs from H I.

these dSphs is similar to the MW halo at the metal-poor end. We also
demonstrate that the luminosity-metallicity relation previously seen in
more luminous dSph galaxies (M_{V}=-13.4 to -8.8) extends
smoothly down to an absolute magnitude of M_{V}=-3.7. The
discovery of extremely metal-poor stars in dSphs lends support to the

To interpret these distributions, we compare them to matched mock
observations drawn from two different cosmological galaxy formation
simulations designed to resemble the Milky Way. This procedure results
in an estimate of the Milky Way's circular velocity curve to \~{}60 kpc,
which is found to be slightly falling from the adopted value of 220 km
s^{-1} at the Sun's location, and implies M({\lt}60
kpc)=(4.0+/-0.7){\times}10^{11} M_{solar}. The radial
dependence of V_{cir}(r), derived in statistically independent
bins, is found to be consistent with the expectations from an NFW dark
matter halo with the established stellar mass components at its center.
If we assume that an NFW halo profile of characteristic concentration
holds, we can use the observations to estimate the virial mass of the
Milky Way's dark matter halo,
M_{vir}=1.0^{+0.3}_{-0.2}{\times}10^{12}
M_{solar}, which is lower than many previous estimates. We have
checked that the particulars of the cosmological simulations are
unlikely to introduce systematics larger than the statistical
uncertainties. This estimate implies that nearly 40\% of the baryons
within the virial radius of the Milky Way's dark matter halo reside in
the stellar components of our Galaxy. A value for M_{vir} of

We show that the choice of metallicity calibration has a significant

The absolute metallicity scale (y-intercept) varies up to
{$\Delta$}[log(O/H)]=0.7 dex, depending on the calibration used, and the
change in shape is substantial. These results indicate that it is
critical to use the same metallicity calibration when comparing
different luminosity-metallicity or M-Z relations. We present new
metallicity conversions that allow metallicities that have been derived
using different strong-line calibrations to be converted to the same
base calibration. These conversions facilitate comparisons between
different samples, particularly comparisons between galaxies at
different redshifts for which different suites of emission lines are
available. Our new conversions successfully remove the large 0.7 dex
discrepancies between the metallicity calibrations, and we reach
agreement in the M-Z relation to within 0.03 dex on average. We
investigate the effect of AGN classification and aperture covering

M_{*}-SFR is observed to be fairly tight with a slope close to
unity from z \~{} 0 -{\gt} 2, and it evolves downwards roughly independently
of M_{*}. Simulations of galaxy formation reproduce these
trends, broadly independent of modelling details, owing to the generic
dominance of smooth and steady cold accretion in these systems. In
contrast, the observed amplitude of the M_{*}-SFR relation
evolves markedly differently than in models, indicating either that
stellar mass assembly is poorly understood or that observations have
been misinterpreted. Stated in terms of a star formation activity
parameter {$\alpha$}_{sf} {\equiv}
(M_{*}/SFR)/(t_{Hubble}-1Gyr), models predict a constant
{$\alpha$}_{sf} \~{} 1 out to redshifts z \~{} 4+, while the observed
M_{*}-SFR relation indicates that {$\alpha$}_{sf} increases
by approximately three times from z \~{} 2 until today. The low
{$\alpha$}_{sf} (i.e. rapid star formation) at high z not only
conflicts with models, but also difficult to reconcile with other
observations of high-z galaxies, such as the small scatter in
M_{*}-SFR, the slow evolution of star-forming galaxies at z \~{}
2-4 and the modest passive fractions in mass-selected samples.
Systematic biases could significantly affect measurements of
M_{*} and SFR, but detailed considerations suggest that none are
obvious candidates to reconcile the discrepancy. A speculative solution
is considered in which the stellar initial mass function (IMF) evolves
towards more high-mass star formation at earlier epochs. Following
Larson, a model is investigated in which the characteristic mass where
the IMF turns over increases with redshift. Population synthesis models
are used to show that the observed and predicted M_{*}-SFR
evolution may be brought into broad agreement if out to z \~{} 2. Such IMF
evolution matches recent observations of cosmic stellar mass growth, and
the resulting z = 0 cumulative IMF is similar to the `paunchy' IMF
favoured by Fardal et al. to reconcile the observed cosmic star
formation history with present-day fossil light measures.

method for computing the LFs takes into account a number of systematic
effects, including photometric scatter, Ly{$\alpha$} line perturbations to
the observed optical colors of galaxies, and contaminants. Taking into
account the latter, we find no evidence for an excess of UV-bright
galaxies over what was inferred in early z\~{}3 LBG studies. The UV LF
appears to undergo little evolution between z\~{}4 and z\~{}2. Corrected for
extinction, the UV luminosity density (LD) at z\~{}2 is at least as large

anchored by extensive spectroscopy on the infrared and bolometric LFs

galaxies, indicates that galaxies with
L_{bol}{\lt}10^{12} L_{solar} account for \~{}80\% of
the bolometric LD and SFRD at z\~{}2-3. This suggests that previous
estimates of the faint end of the L_{bol} LF may have
underestimated the steepness of the faint-end slope at
L_{bol}{\lt}10^{12} L_{solar}. Our
multiwavelength constraints on the global SFRD indicate that
approximately one-third of the present-day stellar mass density was
formed in subultraluminous galaxies between redshifts z=1.9-3.4.

million stars detected by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and map
their three-dimensional number density distribution in the Galaxy. The
currently available data sample the distance range from 100 pc to 20 kpc
and cover 6500 deg^{2} of sky, mostly at high Galactic latitudes
(|b|{\gt}25). These stellar number density maps allow an investigation of
the Galactic structure with no a priori assumptions about the functional
form of its components. The data show strong evidence for a Galaxy
consisting of an oblate halo, a disk component, and a number of
localized overdensities. The number density distribution of stars as
traced by M dwarfs in the solar neighborhood (D{\lt}2 kpc) is well fit by
two exponential disks (the thin and thick disk) with scale heights and
lengths, bias corrected for an assumed 35\% binary fraction, of
H_{1}=300 pc and L_{1}=2600 pc, and H_{2}=900 pc
and L_{2}=3600 pc, and local thick-to-thin disk density
normalization
{$\rho$}_{thick}(R_{solar})/{$\rho$}_{thin}(R_{solar})=12\%.
We use the stars near main-sequence turnoff to measure the shape of the
Galactic halo. We find a strong preference for oblate halo models, with
best-fit axis ratio c/a=0.64, {$\rho$}_{H}\~{}r^{-2.8}
power-law profile, and the local halo-to-thin disk normalization of
0.5\%. Based on a series of Monte Carlo simulations, we estimate the
errors of derived model parameters not to be larger than \~{}20\% for the
disk scales and \~{}10\% for the density normalization, with largest
contributions to error coming from the uncertainty in calibration of the
photometric parallax relation and poorly constrained binary fraction.
While generally consistent with the above model, the measured density
distribution shows a number of statistically significant localized
deviations. In addition to known features, such as the Monoceros stream,
we detect two overdensities in the thick disk region at cylindrical
galactocentric radii and heights (R,Z)\~{}(6.5,1.5) kpc and (R,Z)\~{}(9.5,0.8)
kpc and a remarkable density enhancement in the halo covering over 1000
deg^{2} of sky toward the constellation of Virgo, at distances
of \~{}6-20 kpc. Compared to counts in a region symmetric with respect to
the l=0^{deg} line and with the same Galactic latitude, the
Virgo overdensity is responsible for a factor of 2 number density excess
and may be a nearby tidal stream or a low-surface brightness dwarf
galaxy merging with the Milky Way. The u-g color distribution of stars
associated with it implies metallicity lower than that of thick disk
stars and consistent with the halo metallicity distribution. After
removal of the resolved overdensities, the remaining data are consistent
with a smooth density distribution; we detect no evidence of further
unresolved clumpy substructure at scales ranging from \~{}50 pc in the disk
to \~{}1-2 kpc in the halo.

density profiles, stellar orbits and stellar metallicities (abundances
of elements heavier than helium). The inner halo has a modest net
prograde rotation, whereas the outer halo exhibits a net retrograde
rotation and a peak metallicity one-third that of the inner halo. These
properties indicate that the individual halo components probably formed
in fundamentally different ways, through successive dissipational
(inner) and dissipationless (outer) mergers and tidal disruption of
proto-Galactic clumps.

(ultraviolet) and SDSS photometry to a library of dust-attenuated
population synthesis models. For star-forming galaxies, our UV-based
SFRs compare remarkably well with those from SDSS-measured emission
lines (H{$\alpha$}). Deviations from perfect agreement are shown to be due
to differences in the dust attenuation estimates. In contrast to
H{$\alpha$} measurements, UV provides reliable SFRs for galaxies with weak
H{$\alpha$}, and where H{$\alpha$} is contaminated with AGN emission (1/2 of
the sample). Using full-SED SFRs, we calibrate a simple prescription
that uses GALEX far- and near-UV magnitudes to produce dust-corrected
SFRs for normal star-forming galaxies. The specific SFR is considered as
a function of stellar mass for (1) star-forming galaxies with no AGNs,
(2) those hosting an AGN, and (3) galaxies without H{$\alpha$} emission. We
find that the three have distinct star formation histories, with AGNs
lying intermediate between the star-forming and the quiescent galaxies.
Star-forming galaxies without an AGN lie on a relatively narrow linear
sequence. Remarkably, galaxies hosting a strong AGN appear to represent
the massive continuation of this sequence. On the other hand, weak AGNs,
while also massive, have lower SFRs, sometimes extending to the realm of
quiescent galaxies. We propose an evolutionary sequence for massive
galaxies that smoothly connects normal star-forming galaxies to
quiescent galaxies via strong and weak AGNs. We confirm that some
galaxies with no H{$\alpha$} show signs of star formation in the UV. We
derive a cosmic star formation density at z=0.1 with significantly
smaller total error than previous measurements.

based on a linear combination of H{$\alpha$} emission-line and 24 {$\mu$}m
continuum luminosities, which provides reliable extinction-corrected
ionizing fluxes and SFR densities over a wide range of dust
attenuations. The combination of these extinction-corrected SFR
densities with aperture synthesis H I and CO maps has allowed us to
probe the form of the spatially resolved star formation law on scales of
0.5-2 kpc. We find that the resolved SFR versus gas surface density
relation is well represented by a Schmidt power law, which is similar in
form and dispersion to the disk-averaged Schmidt law. We observe a
comparably strong correlation of the SFR surface density with the
molecular gas surface density, but no significant correlation with the
surface density of atomic gas. The best-fitting slope of the Schmidt law
varies from N=1.37 to 1.56, with zero point and slope that change
systematically with the spatial sampling scale. We tentatively attribute
these variations to the effects of areal sampling and averaging of a
nonlinear intrinsic star formation law. Our data can also be fitted by
an alternative parameterization of the SFR surface density in terms of
the ratio of gas surface density to local dynamical time, but with a
considerable dispersion.

reasons for their wide dispersion. We argue that the results reported

significant role in reionizing the universe. Finally, recent search
results for galaxies at z\~{}7-8 are used to extend our estimates of the

shown in a companion paper. There is a tight and roughly linear
correlation between stellar mass and SFR for 24 {$\mu$}m-detected galaxies.
For a given mass, the SFR at z=2 was larger by a factor of \~{}4 and \~{}30

Typical ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) at z=2 are relatively

submillimeter-selected galaxies. ULIRGs are the common mode of star
formation in massive galaxies at z=2, and the high duty cycle suggests
that major mergers are not the dominant trigger for this activity.
Current galaxy formation models underpredict the normalization of the

formation{\mdash}turbulence, magnetic fields, and self-gravity{\mdash}are
highly nonlinear and multidimensional. Physical arguments are used to
identify and explain the features and scalings involved in star

giant molecular clouds (GMCs) and their substructures. Important
problems include how GMCs form and evolve, what determines the star
formation rate (SFR), and what determines the initial mass function

drawn from the SINGS sample and cover a range of morphologies and a

starburst galaxies and LIRGs are also included in the analysis. Both the
stellar continuum-subtracted 8 {$\mu$}m emission and the 24 {$\mu$}m emission
correlate with the extinction-corrected Pa{$\alpha$} line emission,
although neither relationship is linear. Simple models of stellar
populations and dust extinction and emission are able to reproduce the
observed nonlinear trend of the 24 {$\mu$}m emission versus number of
ionizing photons, including the modest deficiency of 24 {$\mu$}m emission
in the low-metallicity regions, which results from a combination of
decreasing dust opacity and dust temperature at low luminosities.
Conversely, the trend of the 8 {$\mu$}m emission as a function of the
number of ionizing photons is not well reproduced by the same models.
The 8 {$\mu$}m emission is contributed, in larger measure than the 24 {$\mu$}m
emission, by dust heated by nonionizing stellar populations, in addition
to the ionizing ones, in agreement with previous findings. Two SFR
calibrations, one using the 24 {$\mu$}m emission and the other using a
combination of the 24 {$\mu$}m and H{$\alpha$} luminosities (Kennicutt and

 abstract = "{The DEEP2 and COMBO-17 surveys are compared to study luminosity
functions of red and blue galaxies to z\~{}1. The two surveys have
different methods and sensitivities, but nevertheless results agree.
After z\~{}1, M^{*}_{B} has dimmed by 1.2-1.3 mag for all
colors of galaxies, {\phis}^{*} for blue galaxies has hardly
changed, and {\phis}^{*} for red galaxies has at least doubled
(our formal value is \~{}0.5 dex). Luminosity density j_{B} has
fallen by 0.6 dex for blue galaxies but has remained nearly constant for
red galaxies. These results imply that the number and total stellar mass
of blue galaxies have been substantially constant since z\~{}1, whereas
those of red galaxies (near L^{*}) have been significantly
rising. To explain the new red galaxies, a ``mixed'' scenario is
proposed in which star formation in blue cloud galaxies is quenched,
causing them to migrate to the red sequence, where they merge further in
a small number of stellar mergers. This mixed scenario matches the local
boxy-disky transition for nearby ellipticals, as well as red sequence
stellar population scaling laws such as the color-magnitude and
Mg-{$\sigma$} relations (which are explained as fossil relics from blue
progenitors). Blue galaxies enter the red sequence via different
quenching modes, each of which peaks at a different characteristic mass
and time. The red sequence therefore likely builds up in different ways
at different times and masses, and the concept of a single process that
is ``downsizing'' (or upsizing) probably does not apply. Our claim in
this paper of a rise in the number of red galaxies applies to galaxies
near L^{*}. Accurate counts of brighter galaxies on the steep
part of the Schechter function require more accurate photometry than is
currently available.

Deep Survey, GOODS, at z{\tilde}1.   <BR />Methods: We use ultradeep
imaging at 24 {$\mu$}m with the MIPS camera onboard $\{$Spitzer$\}$ to determine
the contribution of obscured light to the SFR of galaxies over the
redshift range 0.8{\le} z {\le}1.2. Accurate galaxy densities are measured
thanks to the large sample of  1200 spectroscopic redshifts with high (
70\%) spectroscopic completeness. Morphology and stellar masses are
derived from deep HST-ACS imaging, supplemented by ground based imaging
programs and photometry from the IRAC camera onboard $\{$Spitzer$\}$.   <BR />Results: We show that the star formation-density relation observed
locally was reversed at z{\tilde} 1: the average SFR of an individual
galaxy increased with local galaxy density when the universe was less
than half its present age. Hierarchical galaxy formation models
(simulated lightcones from the Millennium model) predicted such a
reversal to occur only at earlier epochs (z{\gt}2) and at a lower level.
We present a remarkable structure at z{\tilde} 1.016, containing X-ray
traced galaxy concentrations, which will eventually merge into a
Virgo-like cluster. This structure illustrates how the individual SFR of
galaxies increases with density and shows that it is the  1-2 Mpc scale
that affects most the star formation in galaxies at z{\tilde}1. The SFR
of z{\tilde}1 galaxies is found to correlate with stellar mass suggesting
that mass plays a role in the observed star formation-density trend.
However the specific SFR (=SFR/M_{star}) decreases with stellar
mass while it increases with galaxy density, which implies that the
environment does directly affect the star formation activity of
galaxies. Major mergers do not appear to be the unique or even major
cause for this effect since nearly half (46\%) of the luminous infrared
galaxies (LIRGs) at z{\tilde} 1 present the HST-ACS morphology of
spirals, while only a third present a clear signature of major mergers.
The remaining galaxies are divided into compact (9\%) and irregular (14\%)
galaxies. Moreover, the specific SFR of major mergers is only marginally
stronger than that of spirals.   <BR />Conclusions: These findings
constrain the influence of the growth of large-scale structures on the
star formation history of galaxies. Reproducing the SFR-density relation
at z{\tilde}1 is a new challenge for models, requiring a correct balance
between mass assembly through mergers and in-situ star formation at
early epochs.

logM_{*}. The range of log(SFR) remains constant to z{\gt}1,
while the MS as a whole moves to higher SFR as z increases. The range of
the SFR along the MS constrains the amplitude of episodic variations of
SF and the effect of mergers on the SFR. Typical galaxies spend
\~{}67\%(95\%) of their lifetime since z=1 within a factor of {\lt}\~{}2(4) of
their average SFR at a given M_{*} and z. The dominant mode of
the evolution of SF since z\~{}1 is apparently a gradual decline of the
average SFR in most individual galaxies, not a decreasing frequency of
starburst episodes, or a decreasing factor by which SFRs are enhanced in
starbursts. LIRGs at z\~{}1 seem to mostly reflect the high SFR typical for
massive galaxies at that epoch. The smooth MS may reflect that the same
set of few physical processes governs SF prior to additional quenching
processes. A gradual process like gas exhaustion may play a dominant
role.

PAH emission to the total infrared power is found to peak near 10\% and

bands. A peculiar PAH emission spectrum with markedly diminished 5-8
{$\mu$}m features arises among the sample solely in systems with relatively
hard radiation fields harboring low-luminosity AGNs. The AGNs may modify
the emitting grain distribution and provide the direct excitation source
of the unusual PAH emission, which cautions against using absolute PAH
strength to estimate star formation rates in systems harboring active
nuclei. Alternatively, the low star formation intensity often associated
with weak AGNs may affect the spectrum. The effect of variations in the
mid-infrared spectrum on broadband infrared surveys is modeled and
points to more than a factor of 2 uncertainty in results that assume a
fixed PAH emission spectrum, for redshifts z=0-2.5.

stellar objects (YSOs), covering a wide range of stellar masses (from

envelope infall stage to the late disk-only stage). The grid consists of
20,000 YSO models, with spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and
polarization spectra computed at 10 viewing angles for each model,
resulting in a total of 200,000 SEDs. We have made a careful assessment
of the theoretical and observational constraints on the physical
conditions of disks and envelopes in YSOs and have attempted to fully
span the corresponding regions in parameter space. These models are
publicly available on a dedicated Web server. In this paper we summarize
the main features of our models, as well as the range of parameters
explored. Having a large grid covering reasonable regions of parameter
space allows us to shed light on many trends in near- and mid-IR
observations of YSOs (such as changes in the spectral indices and colors
of their SEDs), linking them with physical parameters (such as disk and
infalling envelope parameters). In particular, we examine the dependence
of the spectral indices of the model SEDs on envelope accretion rate and
disk mass. In addition, we show variations of spectral indices with
stellar temperature, disk inner radius, and disk flaring power for a
subset of disk-only models. We also examine how changing the wavelength
range of data used to calculate spectral indices affects their values.
We show sample color-color plots of the entire grid as well as simulated
clusters at various distances with typical Spitzer sensitivities. We
find that young embedded sources generally occupy a large region of
color-color space due to inclination and stellar temperature effects.
Disk sources occupy a smaller region of color-color space but overlap
substantially with the region occupied by embedded sources, especially
in the near- and mid-IR. We identify regions in color-color space where
our models indicate that only sources at a given evolutionary stage
should lie. We find that, while near-IR (such as JHK) and mid-IR (such
as IRAC) fluxes are useful in discriminating between stars and YSOs, and
are useful for identifying very young sources, the addition of longer
wavelength data such as MIPS 24 {$\mu$}m is extremely valuable for
determining the evolutionary stage of YSOs.

fit these data with simple analytical forms and derive conservative
uncertainties. Since the z{\lt}\~{}1 SFH data are quite precise, we
investigate the sequence of assumptions and corrections that together
affect the SFH normalization to test their accuracy, both in this
redshift range and beyond. As lower limits on this normalization, we
consider the evolution in stellar and metal mass densities, and
supernova rate density, finding it unlikely that the SFH normalization
is much lower than indicated by our direct fit. As a corresponding upper
limit on the SFH normalization, we consider the Super-Kamiokande limit
on the electron antineutrino ({$\nu$}_{e}) flux from past
core-collapse supernovae, which applies primarily to z{\lt}\~{}1. We find
consistency with the SFH only if the neutrino temperatures from
supernova events are relatively modest. Constraints on the assumed
initial mass function (IMF) also become apparent. The traditional
Salpeter IMF, assumed for convenience by many authors, is known to be a
poor representation at low stellar masses ({\lt}\~{}1 M_{solar}),
and we show that recently favored IMFs are also constrained. In
particular, somewhat shallow, or top-heavy, IMFs may be preferred,
although they cannot be too top-heavy. To resolve the outstanding
issues, improved data are called for on the supernova rate density
evolution, the ranges of stellar masses leading to core-collapse and
type Ia supernovae, and the antineutrino and neutrino backgrounds from

pattern in which the sites of active star formation shift from high-mass
galaxies at early times to lower mass systems at later epochs. We
identify a mass limit, M_{Q}, above which star formation appears
to be quenched and show that the physical mechanisms responsible for
downsizing can thus be empirically quantified by charting the evolution
in this threshold mass. We find that M_{Q} decreases with time
by a factor of \~{}3 across our redshift range according to
M_{Q}\~{}(1+z)^{3.5}. To further constrain possible
quenching mechanisms, we investigate how downsizing depends on local
galaxy environment using the projected third-nearest-neighbor statistic
D_{p,3}. For the majority of galaxies near the median density,
there is no significant correlation between downsizing and environment.
However, a trend is observed in the comparison between environments that
are more than 3 times overdense or underdense relative to the median.
Here, downsizing appears accelerated in overdense regions that host
higher numbers of massive, early-type galaxies as compared to the
underdense regions. Our results significantly constrain recent
suggestions for the origin of downsizing and indicate that the process
for quenching star formation must, primarily, be internally driven.

stellar mass are ruled out with {\gt}99\% confidence. Our analysis is
based on 100 spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia, plus 24 photometrically
classified events, all from the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) and
distributed over 0.2{\lt}z{\lt}0.75. We estimate stellar masses and SFRs
for the SN Ia host galaxies by fitting their broadband spectral energy
distributions with the galaxy spectral synthesis code P{\'E}GASE.2.
We show that the SN Ia rate per unit mass is proportional to the
specific SFR of the parent galaxies-more vigorously star-forming
galaxies host more SNe Ia per unit stellar mass, broadly equivalent to
the trend of increasing SN Ia rate in later type galaxies seen in the
local universe. Following earlier suggestions for a simple
``two-component'' model approximating the SN Ia rate, we find bivariate
linear dependencies of the SN Ia rate on both the stellar masses and the
mean SFRs of the host systems. We find that the SN Ia rate can be well
represented as the sum of 5.3+/-1.1{\times}10^{-14} SNe
yr^{-1} M_{solar}^{-1} and
3.9+/-0.7{\times}10^{-4} SNe yr^{-1} (M_{solar}

dependence of distant SN Ia light-curve shapes on star formation in the
host galaxy, similar to trends observed locally. Passive galaxies, with
no star formation, preferentially host faster declining/dimmer SNe Ia,
while brighter events are found in systems with ongoing star formation.

formation in which feedback due to active galactic nuclei (AGN) is
assumed to quench cooling flows in massive haloes. This mechanism
naturally creates a break in the local galaxy luminosity function at
bright magnitudes. The model is implemented within the Millennium N-body
simulation. The accurate dark matter merger trees and large number of
realizations of the galaxy formation process enabled by this simulation
result in highly accurate statistics. After adjusting the values of the
physical parameters in the model by reference to the properties of the
local galaxy population, we investigate the evolution of the K-band
luminosity and galaxy stellar mass functions. We calculate the
volume-averaged star formation rate density of the Universe as a
function of redshift and the way in which this is apportioned amongst
galaxies of different mass. The model robustly predicts a substantial
population of massive galaxies out to redshift z \~{} 5 and a star
formation rate density which rises at least out to z \~{} 2 in objects of
all masses. Although observational data on these properties have been
cited as evidence for `antihierarchical' galaxy formation, we find that
when AGN feedback is taken into account, the fundamentally hierarchical
CDM model provides a very good match to these observations.

dynamical mass is \~{}2 times larger than the average stellar mass, and the
two agree to within a factor of several for most objects. However, \~{}15\%
of the sample has M_{dyn}{\gt}{\gt}M_{*}. These objects
are best fit by young stellar populations and tend to have high H{$\alpha$}
equivalent widths, W_{Hα}{\gt}\~{}200 {\AA}, suggesting that
they are young starbursts with large gas masses. Rest-frame optical
luminosity and velocity dispersion are correlated with 4 {$\sigma$}
significance. Using the local empirical correlation between star
formation rate per unit area and gas surface density, we estimate the
mass of the gas associated with star formation and find a mean gas
fraction of \~{}50\% and a strong decrease in gas fraction with increasing
stellar mass. The masses of gas and stars combined are considerably
better correlated with the dynamical masses than are the stellar masses
alone, and agree to within a factor of 3 for 85\% of the sample. The
combination of kinematic measurements, estimates of gas masses, and
stellar population properties suggest that the factor of \~{}500 range in
stellar mass across the sample cannot be fully explained by intrinsic
differences in the total masses of the galaxies, which vary by a factor
of \~{}40 the remaining variation is due to the evolution of the stellar
population and the conversion of gas into stars.

Several of these OB stars appear to be helium- and nitrogen-rich. Almost
all of the \~{}=80 massive stars now known in the central parsec (central

sharp inner edges (R\~{}=1^{''}) and surface density profiles that
scale as R^{-2}. We do not detect any OB stars outside the
central 0.5 pc. The majority of the stars in the clockwise system appear
to be on almost circular orbits, whereas most of those in the
``counterclockwise'' disk appear to be on eccentric orbits. Based on its
stellar surface density distribution and dynamics, we propose that IRS
13E is an extremely dense cluster

dense gas accretion disks for the two stellar disks. This conclusion is
very clear for the clockwise disk and highly plausible for the

important source of information about the geometry and contents of the
Universe. Even so, only a small fraction of the information available in
the CMB has been extracted to date. Planck, the third space CMB mission
after COBE and WMAP, is designed to extract essentially all of the
information in the CMB temperature anisotropies. Planck will also
measure to high accuracy the polarization of CMB anisotropies, which
encodes not only a wealth of cosmological information but also provides
a unique probe of the thermal history of the Universe during the time
when the first stars and galaxies formed. Polarization measurements may
also detect the signature of a stochastic background of gravitational
waves generated during inflation, 10\^{}(-35) s after the Big Bang. This
book describes the expected scientific output of the Planck mission,
both cosmological and non-cosmological. Chapter 1 summarizes the
experimental concept and the operation of the satellite. Chapter 2
covers the core cosmological science of the mission, describing the
measurements that Planck will make, what we expect to learn from them
about the geometry and contents of the Universe and about fundamental
physics, and the combination of CMB data with other data to provide
additional insights. Although the primary goal of Planck is cosmology,
it will survey the whole sky with an unprecedented combination of
frequency coverage, angular resolution, and sensitivity, providing data
valuable for a broad range of astrophysics. Chapters 3, 4, and 5

galaxies more massive than the Small Magellanic Cloud throughout a

first paper we supplement previous treatments of the growth and activity
of central black holes with a new model for `radio' feedback from those
active galactic nuclei that lie at the centre of a quasi-static
X-ray-emitting atmosphere in a galaxy group or cluster. We show that for
energetically and observationally plausible parameters such a model can
simultaneously explain: (i) the low observed mass drop-out rate in
cooling flows; (ii) the exponential cut-off at the bright end of the
galaxy luminosity function; and (iii) the fact that the most massive
galaxies tend to be bulge-dominated systems in clusters and to contain
systematically older stars than lower mass galaxies. This success occurs
because static hot atmospheres form only in the most massive structures,
and radio feedback (in contrast, for example, to supernova or starburst
feedback) can suppress further cooling and star formation without itself
requiring star formation. We discuss possible physical models that might
explain the accretion rate scalings required for our phenomenological
`radio mode' model to be successful.

energy and entropy in regions free of dissipation, while allowing for
fully adaptive smoothing lengths. Gravitational forces are computed with
a hierarchical multipole expansion, which can optionally be applied in
the form of a TreePM algorithm, where only short-range forces are
computed with the `tree' method while long-range forces are determined
with Fourier techniques. Time integration is based on a quasi-symplectic
scheme where long-range and short-range forces can be integrated with
different time-steps. Individual and adaptive short-range time-steps may
also be employed. The domain decomposition used in the parallelization
algorithm is based on a space-filling curve, resulting in high
flexibility and tree force errors that do not depend on the way the
domains are cut. The code is efficient in terms of memory consumption
and required communication bandwidth. It has been used to compute the
first cosmological N-body simulation with more than 10^{10} dark
matter particles, reaching a homogeneous spatial dynamic range of
10^{5} per dimension in a three-dimensional box. It has also
been used to carry out very large cosmological SPH simulations that
account for radiative cooling and star formation, reaching total
particle numbers of more than 250 million. We present the algorithms
used by the code and discuss their accuracy and performance using a
number of test problems. GADGET-2 is publicly released to the research

the evolution of light and dark matter in accreted satellites. This
distinction is essential to our ability to produce a realistic stellar
halo, with mass and density profile much like that of our own Galaxy,
and a surviving satellite population that matches the observed number
counts and structural parameter distributions of the satellite galaxies
of the Milky Way. Our accreted stellar halos have density profiles that

power laws at r{\gt}\~{}30 kpc with {$\rho$}\~{}r^{-α},

have median accretion times of \~{}9 Gyr in the past, while surviving
satellite systems have median accretion times of \~{}5 Gyr in the past.

We briefly discuss the expected spatial structure and phase-space

the evolution of the comoving infrared (IR) energy density of the
universe up to z\~{}1. Using published ancillary optical data, we first
obtain a nearly complete redshift determination for the 24 {$\mu$}m objects
associated with R{\lt}\~{}24 mag counterparts at z{\lt}\~{}1. These sources
represent \~{}55\%-60\% of the total MIPS 24 {$\mu$}m population with
f_{24μm}{\gt}\~{}80 {$\mu$}Jy, the rest of the sample likely lying
at higher redshifts. We then determine an estimate of their total IR
luminosities using various libraries of IR spectral energy
distributions. We find that the 24 {$\mu$}m population at 0.5{\lt}\~{}z{\lt}\~{}1
is dominated by ``luminous infrared galaxies'' (i.e., 10^{11}
L_{solar}{\lt}=L_{IR}{\lt}=10^{12}
L_{solar}), the counterparts of which appear to be also luminous
at optical wavelengths and tend to be more massive than the majority of
optically selected galaxies. A significant number of fainter sources
(5{\times}10^{10}
L_{solar}{\lt}\~{}L_{IR}{\lt}=10^{11}
L_{solar}) are also detected at similar distances. We finally
derive 15 {$\mu$}m and total IR luminosity functions (LFs) up to z\~{}1. In
agreement with the previous results from the Infrared Space Observatory
(ISO) and SCUBA and as expected from the MIPS source number counts, we
find very strong evolution of the contribution of the IR-selected
population with look-back time. Pure evolution in density is firmly
excluded by the data, but we find considerable degeneracy between strict
evolution in luminosity and a combination of increases in both density
and luminosity
[L^{*}_{IR}\~{}(1+z)^{3.2<SUP>+0.7}_{-0.2}</SUP>,
{\phis}^{*}_{IR}\~{}(1+z)^{0.7<SUP>+0.2}_{-0.6}</SUP>].
A significant steepening of the faint-end slope of the IR luminosity
function is also unlikely, as it would overproduce the faint 24 {$\mu$}m
source number counts. Our results imply that the comoving IR energy
density of the universe evolves as (1+z)^{3.9+/-0.4} up to z\~{}1
and that galaxies luminous in the infrared (i.e.,
L_{IR}{\gt}=10^{11} L_{solar}) are responsible
for 70\%+/-15\% of this energy density at z\~{}1. Taking into account the
contribution of the UV luminosity evolving as (1+z)^{~2.5}, we
infer that these IR-luminous sources dominate the star-forming activity
beyond z\~{}0.7. The uncertainties affecting these conclusions are largely
dominated by the errors in the k-corrections used to convert 24 {$\mu$}m
fluxes into luminosities.

years of nucleus nucleus collision studies at RHIC, with emphasis on
results from the STAR experiment, and we assess their interpretation and
comparison to theory. The theory-experiment comparison suggests that
central Au{\thinsp}+{\thinsp}Au collisions at RHIC produce dense, rapidly
thermalizing matter characterized by: (1) initial energy densities above
the critical values predicted by lattice QCD for establishment of a
quark gluon plasma (QGP); (2) nearly ideal fluid flow, marked by
constituent interactions of very short mean free path, established most
probably at a stage preceding hadron formation; and (3) opacity to jets.
Many of the observations are consistent with models incorporating QGP
formation in the early collision stages, and have not found ready
explanation in a hadronic framework. However, the measurements
themselves do not yet establish unequivocal evidence for a transition to
this new form of matter. The theoretical treatment of the collision
evolution, despite impressive successes, invokes a suite of distinct
models, degrees of freedom and assumptions of as yet unknown
quantitative consequence. We pose a set of important open questions, and
suggest additional measurements, at least some of which should be
addressed in order to establish a compelling basis to conclude
definitively that thermalized, deconfined quark gluon matter has been
produced at RHIC.

and black hole (BH) accretion into simulations of isolated and merging
galaxies. At present, the details of these processes cannot be resolved
in simulations on galactic scales. Our basic approach therefore involves
forming coarse-grained representations of the properties of the
interstellar medium (ISM) and BH accretion starting from basic physical
assumptions, so that the impact of these effects can be included on
resolved scales. We illustrate our method using a multiphase description
of star-forming gas. Feedback from star formation pressurizes highly
overdense gas, altering its effective equation of state (EOS). We show
that this allows the construction of stable galaxy models with much
larger gas fractions than possible in earlier numerical work. We extend
the model by including a treatment of gas accretion onto central
supermassive BHs in galaxies. Assuming thermal coupling of a small
fraction of the bolometric luminosity of accreting BHs to the
surrounding gas, we show how this feedback regulates the growth of BHs.
In gas-rich mergers of galaxies, we observe a complex interplay between
starbursts and central active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity when the
tidal interaction triggers intense nuclear inflows of gas. Once an
accreting supermassive BH has grown to a critical size, feedback
terminates its further growth and expels gas from the central region in
a powerful quasar-driven wind. Our simulation methodology is therefore
able to address the coupled processes of gas dynamics, star formation
and BH accretion during the formation of galaxies.

limiting magnitude of K\~{}16, 9 of 10 stars in the central 0.4'', and 13 of
17 stars out to 0.7'' from the central black hole have spectral
properties of B0-B9 main-sequence stars. Based on the 2.1127 {$\mu$}m He I
line width, all brighter early-type stars have normal rotation
velocities, similar to solar neighborhood stars. We combine the new
radial velocities with SHARP/NACO astrometry to derive improved
three-dimensional stellar orbits for six of these ``S stars'' in the
central 0.5''. Their orientations in space appear random. Their orbital
planes are not co-aligned with those of the two disks of massive young
stars 1''-10'' from Sgr A*. We can thus exclude the hypothesis that the S
stars as a group inhabit the inner regions of these disks. They also
cannot have been located/formed in these disks and then migrated inward
within their planes. From the combination of their normal rotation and
random orbital orientations, we conclude that the S stars were most
likely brought into the central light-month by strong individual
scattering events. The updated estimate of distance to the Galactic
center from the S2 orbit fit is R_{0}=7.62+/-0.32 kpc, resulting
in a central mass value of (3.61+/-0.32){\times}10^{6}
M_{solar}. We happened to catch two smaller flaring events from
Sgr A* during our spectral observations. The 1.7-2.45 {$\mu$}m spectral
energy distributions of these flares are fit by a featureless, ``red''
power law of spectral index {$\alpha$}^{'}=-4+/-1
(S_{ν}\~{}{$\nu$}^{α<SUP>'}</SUP>). The observed
spectral slope is in good agreement with synchrotron models in which the
infrared emission comes from accelerated, nonthermal, high-energy
electrons in a radiatively inefficient accretion flow in the central
R\~{}10R_{S} region.

At z\~{}0.7, nearly 40\% of intermediate- and high-mass galaxies (with

undergoing a period of intense star formation above their past-averaged
SFR. In contrast, less than 1\% of equally massive galaxies in the local

undisturbed galaxies dominate the total infrared luminosity density and
SFR density: at z\~{}0.7, more than half of the intensely star-forming

carbon and nitrogen with respect to iron, suggesting a similar origin of
the abundance patterns. The unexpectedly low Li and high Sr abundances
of HE1327-2326, however, challenge existing theoretical understanding:
no model predicts the high Sr abundance or provides a Li depletion

reviewed, focusing on the regime of low temperatures and
{\ldquo}moderate{\rdquo} densities, which is not accessible by
perturbative QCD. Central issue is the interplay between chiral symmetry
restoration and the formation of color superconducting phases. In order
to lay a solid ground for this analysis, we begin with a rather detailed
discussion of two- and three-flavor NJL models and their phase
structure, neglecting the possibility of diquark pairing in a first
step. An important aspect of this part is a comparison with the MIT bag
model. The NJL model is also applied to investigate the possibility of
absolutely stable strange quark matter. In the next step the formalism
is extended to include diquark condensates. We discuss the role and
mutual influence of several conventional and less conventional quark
antiquark and diquark condensates. As a particularly interesting
example, we analyze a spin-1 diquark condensate as a possible pairing
channel for those quarks which are left over from the standard spin-0
condensate. For three-flavor systems, we find that a self-consistent
calculation of the strange quark mass, together with the diquark
condensates, is crucial for a realistic description of the 2SC CFL phase
transition. We also study the effect of neutrality constraints which are
of relevance for compact stars. Both, homogeneous and mixed, neutral
phases are constructed. Although neutrality constraints generally tend
to disfavor the 2SC phase we find that this phase is again stabilized by
the large values of the dynamical strange quark mass which follow from
the self-consistent treatment. Finally, we combine our solutions with
existing hadronic equations of state to investigate the existence of
quark matter cores in neutron stars.

massive as a billion solar masses powered quasars. Supermassive black
holes are found at the centres of most galaxies today, where their
masses are related to the velocity dispersions of stars in their host
galaxies and hence to the mass of the central bulge of the galaxy. This
suggests a link between the growth of the black holes and their host
galaxies, which has indeed been assumed for a number of years. But the
origin of the observed relation between black hole mass and stellar
velocity dispersion, and its connection with the evolution of galaxies,
have remained unclear. Here we report simulations that simultaneously
follow star formation and the growth of black holes during galaxy-galaxy
collisions. We find that, in addition to generating a burst of star
formation, a merger leads to strong inflows that feed gas to the
supermassive black hole and thereby power the quasar. The energy
released by the quasar expels enough gas to quench both star formation
and further black hole growth. This determines the lifetime of the
quasar phase (approaching 100million years) and explains the
relationship between the black hole mass and the stellar velocity
dispersion.

obtained with the W. M. Keck I 10 m telescope. Within 0.4'' of the
Galaxy's central dark mass, 17 proper-motion stars, with K magnitudes
ranging from 14.0 to 16.8, are identified, and 10 of these are new
detections (six were also independently discovered by others). In this
sample, three newly identified (S0-16, S0-19, and S0-20) and four
previously known (S0-1, S0-2, S0-4, and S0-5) sources have measured
proper motions that reveal orbital solutions. Orbits are derived
simultaneously so that they jointly constrain the central dark object's
properties: its mass, its position, and, for the first time using
orbits, its motion on the plane of the sky. This analysis pinpoints the
Galaxy's central dark mass to within 1.3 mas (10 AU) and limits its
proper motion to 1.5+/-0.5 mas yr^{-1} (or equivalently 60+/-20
km s^{-1}) with respect to the central stellar cluster. This
localization of the central dark mass is consistent with our derivation
of the position of the radio source Sgr A* in the infrared reference
frame (+/-10 mas) but with an uncertainty that is a factor of 8 times
smaller, which greatly facilitates searches for near-infrared
counterparts to the central black hole. Consequently, one previous claim
for such a counterpart can now be ascribed to a close stellar passage in
1996. Furthermore, we can place a conservative upper limit of 15.5 mag
on any steady state counterpart emission. The estimated central dark
mass from orbital motions is

the estimated mass, is now the limiting source of uncertainty in the
absolute mass. For stars in this sample, the closest approach is
achieved by S0-16, which came within a mere 45 AU
(=0.0002pc=600R_{s}) at a velocity of 12,000 km s^{-1}.
This increases the inferred dark mass density by 4 orders of magnitude
compared to earlier analyses based on velocity and acceleration vectors,
making the Milky Way the strongest existing case for a supermassive
black hole at the center of a normal-type galaxy. Well-determined
orbital parameters for these seven Sgr A* cluster stars also provide new
constraints on how these apparently massive, young ({\lt}10 Myr) stars
formed in a region that seems to be hostile to star formation. Unlike
the more distant He I emission line stars-another population of young
stars in the Galactic center-that appear to have coplanar orbits, the
Sgr A* cluster stars have orbital properties (eccentricities, angular
momentum vectors, and apoapse directions) that are consistent with an
isotropic distribution. Therefore, many of the mechanisms proposed for
the formation of the He I stars, such as formation from a preexisting
disk, are unlikely solutions for the Sgr A* cluster stars.
Unfortunately, alternative theories for producing young stars, or old
stars that look young, in close proximity to a central supermassive
black hole are all also somewhat problematic. Understanding the apparent
youth of stars in the Sgr A* cluster, as well as the more distant He I
emission line stars, has now become one of the major outstanding issues
in the study of the Galactic center.

 abstract = "{A simple two-color selection based on B-, z-, and K-band photometry is
proposed for culling galaxies at 1.4{\lt}\~{}z{\lt}\~{}2.5 in K-selected samples
and classifying them as star-forming or passive systems. The method is
calibrated on the highly complete spectroscopic redshift database of the
K20 survey, verified with simulations and tested on other data sets.
Requiring BzK=(z-K)_{AB}-(B-z)_{AB}{\gt}-0.2 allows us to
select actively star-forming galaxies at z{\gt}\~{}1.4, independently of
their dust reddening. On the other hand, objects with BzK{\lt}-0.2 and
(z-K)_{AB}{\gt}2.5 colors include passively evolving galaxies at
z{\gt}\~{}1.4, often with spheroidal morphologies. Simple recipes to
estimate the reddening, star formation rates (SFRs), and masses of
BzK-selected galaxies are derived and are calibrated on K{\lt}20
galaxies. These K{\lt}20 galaxies have typical stellar masses of
\~{}10^{11} M_{solar} and sky and volume densities of \~{}1
arcmin^{-2} and \~{}10^{-4} Mpc^{-3}, respectively.
Based on their UV (reddening-corrected), X-ray, and radio luminosities,
the BzK-selected star-forming galaxies with K{\lt}20 turn out to have
average SFR\~{}200 M_{solar} yr^{-1} and median reddening
E(B-V)\~{}0.4. This SFR is a factor of 10 higher than that of z\~{}1 dusty
extremely red objects, and a factor of 3 higher than found for z\~{}2
UV-selected galaxies, both at similar K limits. Besides missing the
passively evolving galaxies, the UV selection appears to miss some
relevant fraction of the z\~{}2 star-forming galaxies with K{\lt}20, and
hence of the (obscured) SFR density at this redshift. The high SFRs and
masses add to other existing evidence that these z=2 star-forming
galaxies may be among the precursors of z=0 early-type galaxies. A
V/V_{max} test suggests that such a population may be increasing
in number density with increasing redshift. Theoretical models cannot
reproduce simultaneously the space density of both passively evolving
and highly star-forming galaxies at z=2. In view of Spitzer Space
Telescope observations, an analogous technique based on RJL photometry
is proposed to complement the BzK selection and to identify massive
galaxies at 2.5{\lt}\~{}z{\lt}\~{}4.0. By selecting passively evolving galaxies
as well as actively star-forming galaxies (including strongly
dust-reddened ones), these color criteria should help in completing the
census of the stellar mass and of the SFR density at high redshift.

Some recent analyses of z\~{}6 photometric dropouts are suggestive of a

the extent of dust obscuration at such high redshifts. In less than a
decade, numerous measurements of galaxy SFR density spanning z=0 to as
high as z\~{}6 have rapidly broadened our understanding of galaxy
evolution, and a summary of existing SFR density measurements is
presented here. This global star formation history compilation is found
to be consistent to within factors of about 3 over essentially the
entire range 0{\lt}z{\lt}\~{}6, and it can be used to constrain the evolution
of the luminosity function (LF) for star-forming galaxies. The LF
evolution for star-forming galaxies has been previously explored using
optical source counts, as well as radio source counts at 1.4 GHz, and a
well-known degeneracy between luminosity evolution [L\~{}(1+z)^{Q}]

Survey to study how structure, star formation and nuclear activity
depend on local density and on stellar mass. Local density is estimated
by counting galaxies above a fixed absolute magnitude limit within
cylinders 2 Mpc in projected radius and +/-500 km s^{-1} in
depth. The stellar mass distribution of galaxies shifts by almost a
factor of two towards higher masses between low- and high-density
regions. At fixed stellar mass both star formation and nuclear activity
depend strongly on local density, while structural parameters such as
size and concentration are almost independent of it. Only for low-mass
galaxies (M_{*} {\lt} 3 {\times} 10^{10}
M_{solar}, where M_{*}= stellar mass) do we find a weak
shift towards greater concentration and compactness in the
highest-density regions. The galaxy property most sensitive to
environment is specific star formation rate (SFR). For galaxies with
stellar masses in the range 10^{10}-3 {\times} 10^{10}
M_{solar}, the median SFR/M_{*} decreases by more than a
factor of 10 as the population shifts from predominantly star-forming at
low densities to predominantly inactive at high densities. This decrease
is less marked, but still significant, for high-mass galaxies. Galaxy
properties that are associated with star formation correlate strongly
with local density. At fixed stellar mass twice as many galaxies host
active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with strong [OIII] emission in low-density
regions as in high. Massive galaxies in low-density environments also
contain more dust. To gain insight into the processes that shut down
star formation, we analyse correlations between spectroscopic indicators
that probe the star formation history (SFH) on different time-scales:
the {$\lambda$}4000 break strength, the Balmer-absorption index
H{$\delta$}_{A}, and the specific SFR/M_{*}. The
correlations between these indicators do not depend on environment,
suggesting that the decrease in star formation activity in dense
environments occurs over long ({\gt}1-Gyr) time-scales. Since structure
does not depend on environment for galaxies with masses greater than 3
{\times} 10^{10} M_{solar}, the trends in recent SFH,
dust and nuclear activity in these systems cannot be driven by processes
that alter structure, for example mergers or harassment. The SFH-density
correlation is strongest for small-scale estimates of local density. We
see no evidence that star formation history depends on environment more
than 1 Mpc from a galaxy. Finally, we highlight a striking similarity
between the changes in the galaxy population as a function of density
and as a function of redshift. We use mock catalogues derived from
N-body simulations to explain how this may be understood.

study the distribution of star formation as a function of various

low-redshift Universe takes place in moderately massive galaxies
(10^{10}-10^{11} M_{solar}), typically in high
surface brightness disc galaxies. Roughly 15 per cent of all star
formation takes place in galaxies that show some sign of an active
nucleus. About 20 per cent occurs in starburst galaxies. By focusing on
the SFR per unit mass we show that the present to past average SFR, the
Scalo b-parameter, is almost constant over almost three orders of

the star formation history of the Universe. For the concordance
cosmology the present-day Universe is forming stars at at least 1/3 of
its past average rate. For an exponentially declining cosmic star
formation history this corresponds to a time-scale of
7^{+0.7}_{-1.5} Gyr. In agreement with other work we
find a correlation between b and morphological type, as well as a tight
correlation between the 4000-{\AA}break (D4000) and b. We discuss how
D4000 can be used to estimate b parameters for high-redshift galaxies.

 abstract = "{In the framework of the ESO Large Programme ``First Stars'', very
high-quality spectra of some 70 very metal-poor dwarfs and giants were
obtained with the ESO VLT and UVES spectrograph. These stars are likely
to have descended from the first generation(s) of stars formed after the
Big Bang, and their detailed composition provides constraints on issues
such as the nature of the first supernovae, the efficiency of mixing
processes in the early Galaxy, the formation and evolution of the halo
of the Galaxy, and the possible sources of reionization of the Universe.
This paper presents the abundance analysis of an homogeneous sample of
35 giants selected from the HK survey of Beers et al. ($\backslash$cite$\{$BPS92$\}$,
$\backslash$cite$\{$Be99$\}$), emphasizing stars of extremely low metallicity: 30 of our
35 stars are in the range -4.1 {\lt}[Fe/H]{\lt} -2.7, and 22 stars have
[Fe/H] {\lt} -3.0. Our new VLT/UVES spectra, at a resolving power of
R{\tilde}45 000 and with signal-to-noise ratios of 100-200 per pixel over
the wavelength range 330-1000 nm, are greatly superior to those of the
classic studies of McWilliam et al. ($\backslash$cite$\{$MPS95$\}$) and Ryan et al.
($\backslash$cite$\{$RNB96$\}$).

The immediate objective of the work is to determine precise,
comprehensive, and homogeneous element abundances for this large sample
of the most metal-poor giants presently known. In the analysis we
combine the spectral line modeling code ``Turbospectrum'' with OSMARCS
model atmospheres, which treat continuum scattering correctly and thus
allow proper interpretation of the blue regions of the spectra, where
scattering becomes important relative to continuous absorption ({$\lambda$}
{\lt} 400 nm). We obtain detailed information on the trends of elemental
abundance ratios and the star-to-star scatter around those trends,
enabling us to separate the relative contributions of cosmic scatter and
observational/analysis errors.

Abundances of 17 elements from C to Zn have been measured in all stars,
including K and Zn, which have not previously been detected in stars
with [Fe/H] {\lt} -3.0. Among the key results, we discuss the oxygen
abundance (from the forbidden [OI] line), the different and sometimes
complex trends of the abundance ratios with metallicity, the very tight
relationship between the abundances of certain elements (e.g., Fe and
Cr), and the high [Zn/Fe] ratio in the most metal-poor stars. Within the
error bars, the trends of the abundance ratios with metallicity are
consistent with those found in earlier literature, but in many cases the
scatter around the average trends is much smaller than found in earlier
studies, which were limited to lower-quality spectra. We find that the
cosmic scatter in several element ratios may be as low as 0.05 dex.

The evolution of the abundance trends and scatter with declining
metallicity provides strong constraints on the yields of the first
supernovae and their mixing into the early ISM. The abundance ratios
found in our sample do not match the predicted yields from
pair-instability hypernovae, but are consistent with element production
by supernovae with progenitor masses up to 100 M_{ȯ}.

versions of the ones presented in our previous work. However, we also
present parameters for 18 stars with planets not previously published,
and a compilation of stellar parameters for the remaining 4 planet-hosts
for which we could not obtain a spectrum. A comparison of our stellar
parameters with values of T_{eff}, log g, and [Fe/H] available
in the literature shows a remarkable agreement. In particular, our
spectroscopic log g values are now very close to trigonometric log g
estimates based on Hipparcos parallaxes. The derived [Fe/H] values are
then used to confirm the previously known result that planets are more
prevalent around metal-rich stars. Furthermore, we confirm that the
frequency of planets is a strongly rising function of the stellar
metallicity, at least for stars with [Fe/H] {\gt} 0. While only about 3\%
of the solar metallicity stars in the CORALIE planet search sample were
found to be orbited by a planet, this number increases to more than 25\%
for stars with [Fe/H] above +0.3. Curiously, our results also suggest
that these percentages might remain relatively constant for values of
[Fe/H] lower than about solar, increasing then linearly with the mass
fraction of heavy elements. These results are discussed in the context
of the theories of planetary formation.

modern astrophysics. However, a quantitative prediction of the star
formation rate and the initial distribution of stellar masses remains
elusive. For several decades it has been thought that the star formation
process is primarily controlled by the interplay between gravity and
magnetostatic support, modulated by neutral-ion drift (known as
ambipolar diffusion in astrophysics). Recently, however, both
observational and numerical work has begun to suggest that supersonic
turbulent flows rather than static magnetic fields control star
formation. To some extent, this represents a return to ideas popular
before the importance of magnetic fields to the interstellar gas was
fully appreciated. This review gives a historical overview of the
successes and problems of both the classical dynamical theory and the
standard theory of magnetostatic support, from both observational and
theoretical perspectives. The outline of a new theory relying on control
by driven supersonic turbulence is then presented. Numerical models
demonstrate that, although supersonic turbulence can provide global
support, it nevertheless produces density enhancements that allow local
collapse. Inefficient, isolated star formation is a hallmark of
turbulent support, while efficient, clustered star formation occurs in
its absence. The consequences of this theory are then explored for both
local star formation and galactic-scale star formation. It suggests that
individual star-forming cores are likely not quasistatic objects, but
dynamically collapsing. Accretion onto these objects varies depending on
the properties of the surrounding turbulent flow; numerical models agree
with observations showing decreasing rates. The initial mass
distribution of stars may also be determined by the turbulent flow.
Molecular clouds appear to be transient objects forming and dissolving
in the larger-scale turbulent flow, or else quickly collapsing into
regions of violent star formation. Global star formation in galaxies
appears to be controlled by the same balance between gravity and
turbulence as small-scale star formation, although modulated by cooling
and differential rotation. The dominant driving mechanism in
star-forming regions of galaxies appears to be supernovae, while
elsewhere coupling of rotation to the gas through magnetic fields or
gravity may be important.

pulsing stars on the asymptotic giant branch. The latter is supported by
observations of surface brightness fluctuations in nearby stellar
populations. We show that this model reproduces well the observed
optical and near-infrared colour-magnitude diagrams of Galactic star
clusters of various ages and metallicities. Stochastic fluctuations in
the numbers of stars in different evolutionary phases can account for
the full range of observed integrated colours of star clusters in the
Magellanic Clouds. The model reproduces in detail typical galaxy spectra
from the Early Data Release (EDR) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey

physical parameters such as the star formation history, metallicity and
dust content of galaxies. Our model is the first to enable accurate
studies of absorption-line strengths in galaxies containing stars over
the full range of ages. Using the highest-quality spectra of the SDSS
EDR, we show that this model can reproduce simultaneously the observed
strengths of those Lick indices that do not depend strongly on element
abundance ratios. The interpretation of such indices with our model
should be particularly useful for constraining the star formation
histories and metallicities of galaxies.

on the Very Large Telescope at the European Southern Observatory,
Chile), as well as new proper-motion data of the nuclear star cluster of
the Milky Way. The surface density distribution of faint (H{\lt}=20,
K_{s}{\lt}=19) stars peaks within 0.2'' of the black hole
candidate Sgr A*. The radial density distribution of this stellar
``cusp'' follows a power law of exponent {$\alpha$}\~{}1.3-1.4. The K-band
luminosity function of the overall nuclear stellar cluster (within
9^{''} of Sgr A*) resembles that of the large-scale Galactic
bulge but shows an excess of stars at K_{s}{\lt}=14. It fits
population synthesis models of an old, metal-rich stellar population
with a contribution from young, early, and late-type stars at the bright
end. In contrast, the cusp within {\lt}=1.5'' of Sgr A* appears to have a
featureless luminosity function, suggesting that old, low-mass,
horizontal-branch/red-clump stars are lacking. Likewise, there appear to
be fewer late-type giants. The innermost cusp also contains a group of
moderately bright, early-type stars that are tightly bound to the black
hole. We interpret these results as evidence that the stellar properties
change significantly from the outer cluster ({\gt}=a few arcseconds) to
the dense innermost region around the black hole. We find that most of
the massive early-type stars at distances of 1''-10'' from Sgr A* are
located in two rotating and geometrically thin disks. These disks are
inclined at large angles and counterrotate with respect to each other.
Their stellar content is essentially the same, indicating that they
formed at the same time. We conclude that of the possible formation
scenarios for these massive stars the most probable one is that 5-8
million years ago two clouds fell into the center, collided, were shock
compressed, and then formed two rotating (accretion) disks orbiting the
central black hole. For the OB stars in the central arcsecond, on the
other hand, a stellar merger model is the most appealing explanation.
These stars may thus be ``super-blue stragglers,'' formed and
``rejuvenated'' through mergers of lower mass stars in the very dense
({\gt}=10^{8} M_{solar} pc^{-3}) environment of
the cusp. The ``collider model'' also accounts for the lack of giants
within the central few arcseconds. The star closest to Sgr A* in 2002,
S2, exhibits a 3.8 {$\mu$}m excess. We propose that the mid-IR emission
comes either from the accretion flow around the black hole itself or
from dust in the accretion flow that is heated by the ultraviolet
emission of S2.

 abstract = "{We review recent determinations of the present-day mass function (PDMF)
and initial mass function (IMF) in various components of the
Galaxy-disk, spheroid, young, and globular clusters-and in conditions
characteristic of early star formation. As a general feature, the IMF is
found to depend weakly on the environment and to be well described by a
power-law form for m{\gt}\~{}1 M_{solar} and a lognormal form below,
except possibly for early star formation conditions. The disk IMF for
single objects has a characteristic mass around m_{c}\~{}0.08
M_{solar} and a variance in logarithmic mass {$\sigma$}\~{}0.7,
whereas the IMF for multiple systems has m_{c}\~{}0.2
M_{solar} and {$\sigma$}\~{}0.6. The extension of the single MF into
the brown dwarf regime is in good agreement with present estimates of L-
and T-dwarf densities and yields a disk brown dwarf number density
comparable to the stellar one, n_{BD}\~{}n_{*}\~{}0.1
pc^{-3}. The IMF of young clusters is found to be consistent
with the disk field IMF, providing the same correction for unresolved
binaries, confirming the fact that young star clusters and disk field
stars represent the same stellar population. Dynamical effects, yielding
depletion of the lowest mass objects, are found to become consequential
for ages {\gt}\~{}130 Myr. The spheroid IMF relies on much less robust
grounds. The large metallicity spread in the local subdwarf photometric
sample, in particular, remains puzzling. Recent observations suggest
that there is a continuous kinematic shear between the thick-disk
population, present in local samples, and the genuine spheroid one. This
enables us to derive only an upper limit for the spheroid mass density
and IMF. Within all the uncertainties, the latter is found to be similar
to the one derived for globular clusters and is well represented also by
a lognormal form with a characteristic mass slightly larger than for the
disk, m_{c}\~{}0.2-0.3 M_{solar}, excluding a significant
population of brown dwarfs in globular clusters and in the spheroid. The
IMF characteristic of early star formation at large redshift remains
undetermined, but different observational constraints suggest that it
does not extend below \~{}1 M_{solar}. These results suggest a
characteristic mass for star formation that decreases with time, from
conditions prevailing at large redshift to conditions characteristic of
the spheroid (or thick disk) to present-day conditions. These
conclusions, however, remain speculative, given the large uncertainties
in the spheroid and early star IMF determinations.

These IMFs allow a reasonably robust determination of the Galactic
present-day and initial stellar and brown dwarf contents. They also have
important galactic implications beyond the Milky Way in yielding more
accurate mass-to-light ratio determinations. The mass-to-light ratios
obtained with the disk and the spheroid IMF yield values 1.8-1.4 times
smaller than for a Salpeter IMF, respectively, in agreement with various
recent dynamical determinations. This general IMF determination is
examined in the context of star formation theory. None of the theories
based on a Jeans-type mechanism, where fragmentation is due only to
gravity, can fulfill all the observational constraints on star formation
and predict a large number of substellar objects. On the other hand,
recent numerical simulations of compressible turbulence, in particular
in super-Alfv{\'e}nic conditions, seem to reproduce both
qualitatively and quantitatively the stellar and substellar IMF and thus
provide an appealing theoretical foundation. In this picture, star
formation is induced by the dissipation of large-scale turbulence to
smaller scales through radiative MHD shocks, producing filamentary
structures. These shocks produce local nonequilibrium structures with
large density contrasts, which collapse eventually in gravitationally
bound objects under the combined influence of turbulence and gravity.
The concept of a single Jeans mass is replaced by a distribution of
local Jeans masses, representative of the lognormal probability density
function of the turbulent gas. Objects below the mean thermal Jeans mass
still have a possibility to collapse, although with a decreasing
probability.

{\times} 10^{10} M_{solar}. Lower-mass galaxies have
young stellar populations, low surface mass densities and the low

strongly correlated with surface mass density than with stellar mass. A
significant fraction of the lowest-mass galaxies in our sample have
experienced recent starbursts. At given stellar mass, the sizes of
low-mass galaxies are lognormally distributed with dispersion
{$\sigma$}(lnR_{50}) \~{} 0.5, in excellent agreement with the idea
that they form with little angular momentum loss through cooling and
condensation in a gravitationally dominant dark matter halo. Their
median stellar surface mass density scales with stellar mass as
{$\mu$}_{*}\~{}M^{0.54}_{*}, suggesting that the
stellar mass of a disc galaxy is proportional to the three halves power
of its halo mass. All of this suggests that the efficiency of the
conversion of baryons into stars in low-mass galaxies increases in
proportion to halo mass, perhaps as a result of supernova feedback
processes. At stellar masses above 3 {\times} 10^{10}

with old stellar populations, high surface mass densities and the high

constant. This suggests that the star formation efficiency decreases in
the highest-mass haloes, and that little star formation occurs in
massive galaxies after they have assembled.

to star formation theories, given the strong tidal forces that prevail
over all distances reached by S0-2 in its current orbit (130-1900 AU)
and the difficulty in migrating this star inward during its lifetime
from farther out where tidal forces should no longer preclude star
formation. The radial velocity measurements (z{\gt}=-510+/-40

formation to resolve the fragmentation process down to the opacity
limit. The simulation follows the collapse and fragmentation of a
large-scale turbulent molecular cloud to form a stellar cluster and,
simultaneously, the formation of circumstellar discs and binary stars.
This large range of scales enables us to predict a wide variety of
stellar properties for comparison with observations.

The calculation clearly demonstrates that star formation is a
highly-dynamic and chaotic process. Star formation occurs in localized
bursts within the cloud via the fragmentation both of dense molecular
cloud cores and of massive circumstellar discs. Star-disc encounters
form binaries and truncate discs. Stellar encounters disrupt bound
multiple systems. We find that the observed statistical properties of
stars are a natural consequence of star formation in such a dynamical
environment. The cloud produces roughly equal numbers of stars and brown
dwarfs, with masses down to the opacity limit for fragmentation (\~{}5
Jupiter masses). The initial mass function is consistent with a Salpeter
slope ({$\Gamma$}=-1.35) above 0.5 M_{solar}, a roughly flat
distribution ({$\Gamma$}= 0) in the range 0.006-0.5 M_{solar}, and
a sharp cut-off below \~{}0.005 M_{solar}. This is consistent with
recent observational surveys. The brown dwarfs form by the dynamical
ejection of low-mass fragments from dynamically unstable multiple
systems before the fragments have been able to accrete to stellar
masses. Close binary systems (with separations {\lt}\~{}10 au) are not
formed by fragmentation in situ. Rather, they are produced by hardening
of initially wider multiple systems through a combination of dynamical
encounters, gas accretion, and/or the interaction with circumbinary and
circumtriple discs. Finally, we find that the majority of circumstellar
discs have radii less than 20 au due to truncation in dynamical
encounters. This is consistent with observations of the Orion Trapezium
cluster and implies that most stars and brown dwarfs do not form large
planetary systems.

 abstract = "{We present a model for star formation and supernova feedback that
describes the multiphase structure of star-forming gas on scales that
are typically not resolved in cosmological simulations. Our approach
includes radiative heating and cooling, the growth of cold clouds
embedded in an ambient hot medium, star formation in these clouds,
feedback from supernovae in the form of thermal heating and cloud
evaporation, galactic winds and outflows, and metal enrichment.
Implemented using smoothed particle hydrodynamics, our scheme is a
significantly modified and extended version of the grid-based method of
Yepes et al., and enables us to achieve a high dynamic range in
simulations of structure formation.

We discuss properties of the feedback model in detail and show that it
predicts a self-regulated, quiescent mode of star formation, which, in
particular, stabilizes the star-forming gaseous layers of disc galaxies.
The parametrization of this mode can be reduced to a single free
quantity that determines the overall time-scale for star formation. We
fix this parameter numerically to match the observed rates of star
formation in local disc galaxies. When normalized in this manner,
cosmological simulations employing our model nevertheless overproduce
the observed cosmic abundance of stellar material. We are thus motivated
to extend our feedback model to include galactic winds associated with
star formation.

Using small-scale simulations of individual star-forming disc galaxies,
we show that these winds produce either galactic fountains or outflows,
depending on the depth of the gravitational potential. In low-mass
haloes, winds can greatly suppress the overall efficiency of star
formation. When incorporated into cosmological simulations, our combined
model for star formation and winds predicts a cosmic star formation
density that is consistent with observations, provided that the winds
are sufficiently energetic. Moreover, outflows from galaxies in these
simulations drive chemical enrichment of the intergalactic medium - in
principle, accounting for the presence of metals in the Lyman {$\alpha$}
forest.

 abstract = "{We present in this paper a detailed analysis of the effect of
environment on the star formation activity of galaxies within the Early
Data Release (EDR) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We have used
the H{$\alpha$} emission line to derive the star formation rate (SFR) for
each galaxy within a volume-limited sample of 8598 galaxies with
0.05{\lt}=z{\lt}=0.095 and M(r^{*}){\lt}=-20.45. We find that the
SFR of galaxies is strongly correlated with the local (projected) galaxy
density, and thus we present here a density-SFR relation that is
analogous to the density-morphology relation. The effect of density on
the SFR of galaxies is seen in three ways. First, the overall
distribution of SFRs is shifted to lower values in dense environments
compared with the field population. Second, the effect is most
noticeable for the strongly star-forming galaxies (H{$\alpha$} EW{\gt}5
{\AA}) in the 75th percentile of the SFR distribution. Third, there is
a ``break'' (or characteristic density) in the density-SFR relation at a
local galaxy density of \~{}1 h^{-2}_{75} Mpc^{-2}.
To understand this break further, we have studied the SFR of galaxies as
a function of clustercentric radius from 17 clusters and groups
objectively selected from the SDSS EDR data. The distribution of SFRs of
cluster galaxies begins to change, compared with the field population,
at a clustercentric radius of 3-4 virial radii (at the {\gt}1 {$\sigma$}
statistical significance), which is consistent with the characteristic
break in density that we observe in the density-SFR relation. This
effect with clustercentric radius is again most noticeable for the most
strongly star-forming galaxies. Our tests suggest that the
density-morphology relation alone is unlikely to explain the density-SFR
relation we observe. For example, we have used the (inverse)
concentration index of SDSS galaxies to classify late-type galaxies and
show that the distribution of the star-forming (EW H{$\alpha$}{\gt}5
{\AA}) late-type galaxies is different in dense regions (within 2
virial radii) compared with similar galaxies in the field. However, at
present, we are unable to make definitive statements about the
independence of the density-morphology and density-SFR relation. We have
tested our work against potential systematic uncertainties including
stellar absorption, reddening, SDSS survey strategy, SDSS analysis
pipelines, and aperture bias. Our observations are in qualitative
agreement with recent simulations of hierarchical galaxy formation that
predict a decrease in the SFR of galaxies within the virial radius. Our
results are in agreement with recent 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey results
as well as consistent with previous observations of a decrease in the
SFR of galaxies in the cores of distant clusters. Taken together, these
works demonstrate that the decrease in SFR of galaxies in dense
environments is a universal phenomenon over a wide range in density
(from 0.08 to 10 h^{-2}_{75} Mpc^{ -2}) and
redshift (out to z\~{}=0.5).

explained as the consequence of supersonic turbulence. Supersonic
turbulence fragments MCs into dense sheets, filaments, and cores and
large low-density ``voids,'' via the action of highly radiative shocks.
We refer to this process as turbulent fragmentation. In this work we
derive the mass distribution of gravitationally unstable cores generated
by the process of turbulent fragmentation. The mass distribution above 1
M_{solar} depends primarily on the power spectrum of the
turbulent flow and on the jump conditions for isothermal shocks in a
magnetized gas. For a power spectrum index {$\beta$}=1.74, consistent with
Larson's velocity dispersion-size relation as well as with new numerical
and analytic results on supersonic turbulence, we obtain a power-law
mass distribution of dense cores with a slope equal to
3/(4-{$\beta$})=1.33, consistent with the slope of the stellar initial mass
function (IMF). Below 1 M_{solar}, the mass distribution
flattens and turns around at a fraction of 1 M_{solar}, as
observed for the stellar IMF in a number of stellar clusters, because
only the densest cores are gravitationally unstable. The mass
distribution at low masses is determined by the probability distribution
of the gas density, which is known to be approximately lognormal for an
isothermal turbulent gas. The intermittent nature of the turbulent
density distribution is thus responsible for the existence of a
significant number of small collapsing cores, even of substellar mass.
Since turbulent fragmentation is unavoidable in supersonically turbulent
molecular clouds, and given the success of the present model in
predicting the observed shape of the stellar IMF, we conclude that
turbulent fragmentation is essential to the origin of the stellar IMF.

they assemble via hierarchical merging, primordial gas cools through
ro-vibrational lines of hydrogen molecules and sinks to the center of
the dark matter potential well. The high-redshift analog of a molecular
cloud is formed. As the dense, central parts of the cold gas cloud
become self-gravitating, a dense core of \~{}100 M_{solar} (where
M_{solar} is the mass of the Sun) undergoes rapid contraction.
At particle number densities greater than 10^{9} per cubic
centimeter, a 1 M_{solar} protostellar core becomes fully
molecular as a result of three-body H_{2} formation. Contrary to
analytical expectations, this process does not lead to renewed
fragmentation and only one star is formed. The calculation is stopped
when optical depth effects become important, leaving the final mass of
the fully formed star somewhat uncertain. At this stage the protostar is
accreting material very rapidly (\~{}10^{-2} M_{solar}
year^{-1}). Radiative feedback from the star will not only halt
its growth but also inhibit the formation of other stars in the same
pregalactic object (at least until the first star ends its life,

explore the physics of primordial star formation by means of
three-dimensional simulations of the dark matter and gas components,
using smoothed particle hydrodynamics, under a wide range of initial
conditions, including the initial spin, the total mass of the halo, the
redshift of virialization, the power spectrum of the DM fluctuations,
the presence of HD cooling, and the number of particles employed in the
simulation. We find characteristic values for the temperature, T\~{}a few
100 K, and the density, n\~{}10^{3}-10^{4} cm^{-3},
characterizing the gas at the end of the initial free-fall phase. These
values are rather insensitive to the initial conditions. The
corresponding Jeans mass is M_{J}\~{}10^{3}
M_{solar}. The existence of these characteristic values has a
robust explanation in the microphysics of H_{2} cooling,
connected to the minimum temperature that can be reached with the
H_{2} coolant, and to the critical density at which the
transition takes place between levels being populated according to
non-LTE (NLTE), and according to LTE. In all cases, the gas
dissipatively settles into an irregular, central configuration that has
a filamentary and knotty appearance. The fluid regions with the highest
densities are the first to undergo runaway collapse due to gravitational
instability, and to form clumps with initial masses \~{}10^{3}
M_{solar}, close to the characteristic Jeans scale. These
results suggest that the first stars might have been quite massive,
possibly even very massive with M_{*}{\gt}\~{}100 M_{solar}.
After a gas element has undergone runaway collapse, and has reached
densities in excess of 10^{8} cm^{-3}, a sink particle
is created. This procedure allows us to follow the evolution of the
overall system beyond the point where the first nonlinear region would
otherwise force the calculation to a halt. These later evolutionary
stages, during which the clumps grow in mass due to accretion and
merging with other clumps, are quite sensitive to the initial
conditions. The key process in building up very massive clumps, with
masses up to a few times 10^{4} M_{solar}, is merging
between clumps. Since the merging rate sensitively depends on the
density of the gas, halos with the highest degree of central
concentration are able to assemble the most massive clumps. Among these
are halos with a low spin ({$\lambda$}\~{}=0.01), and with DM fluctuations
imprinted according to a white-noise spectrum.

evolutionary models provide satisfactory fits to the CIRB and the number
counts. The degeneracy in the range of models cannot be broken by
current observations. However, the different evolutionary models yield
approximately the same comoving number density of infrared luminous
galaxies as a function of redshift. Since the spectrum of the cosmic
background at {$\lambda$}{\gt}200 {$\mu$}m is quite sensitive to the evolution
at high redshift, i.e., z{\gt}1, all models that fit the counts require a
flattening at z\~{}0.8 to avoid overproducing the CIRB. About 80\% of the
140 {$\mu$}m CIRB is produced at 0{\lt}z{\lt}1.5, while only about 30\% of the
850 {$\mu$}m background is produced within the same redshift range. The
nature of the evolution is then translated into a measure of the
dust-enshrouded star formation rate (SFR) density as a function of
redshift and compared with estimates from rest-frame optical/ultraviolet
surveys. The dust-enshrouded SFR density appears to peak at z=0.8+/-0.1,

trace the evolution at z{\gt}2 and a drop-off in the dust-enshrouded SFR

However, a comparison with the infrared luminosity function derived from
extinction-corrected rest-frame optical/ultraviolet observations of the

Keck telescope and the Very Large Telescope augmented with data from the
literature for an additional four objects, we reach the following main
conclusions. The rest-frame optical properties of LBGs at the bright end
of the luminosity function are remarkably uniform, their spectra are
dominated by emission lines, [O III] is always stronger than H{$\beta$} and
[O II], and projected velocity dispersions are between 50 and 115 km
s^{-1}. Contrary to expectations, the star formation rates
deduced from the H{$\beta$} luminosity are on average no larger than those
implied by the stellar continuum at 1500 {\AA} presumably any
differential extinction between rest-frame optical and UV wavelengths is
small compared to the relative uncertainties in the calibrations of
these two star formation tracers. For the galaxies in our sample, the
abundance of oxygen can only be determined to within 1 order of
magnitude without recourse to other emission lines ([N II] and
H{$\alpha$}), which are generally not available. Even so, it seems well
established that LBGs are the most metal-enriched structures at z\~{}=3,
apart from quasi-stellar objects, with abundances greater than about
1/10 solar and generally higher than those of damped Ly{$\alpha$} systems
at the same epoch. They are also significantly overluminous for their
metallicities; this is probably an indication that their mass-to-light
ratios are low compared to present-day galaxies. At face value, the
measured velocity dispersions imply virial masses of about
10^{10} M_{solar} within half-light radii of 2.5 kpc.
The corresponding mass-to-light ratios, M/L\~{}0.15 in solar units, are
indicative of stellar populations with ages between 10^{8} and
10^{9} yr, consistent with the UV-optical spectral energy
distributions. However, we are unable to establish conclusively whether
or not the widths of the emission lines reflect the motions of the H II
regions within the gravitational potential of the galaxies, even though
in two cases we see hints of rotation curves. All 19 LBGs observed show
evidence for galactic-scale superwinds; such outflows have important
consequences for regulating star formation, distributing metals over
large volumes, and allowing Lyman continuum photons to escape and ionize
the intergalactic medium. Based on data obtained at the European

evolution models to argue that there are substantial variations in

to factors of between 3 and 7 in the optical and factors of 2 in the
near-infrared. Our models show a strong correlation between stellar M/L
and the optical colors of the integrated stellar populations. Under the
assumption of a universal spiral galaxy initial mass function (IMF),
relative trends in model stellar M/L with color are robust to
uncertainties in stellar population and galaxy evolution modeling,
including the effects of modest bursts of star formation. Errors in the
dust-reddening estimates do not strongly affect the final derived
stellar masses of a stellar population. We examine the observed maximum
disk stellar M/L ratios of a sample of spiral galaxies with accurate
rotation curves and optical and near-infrared luminosity profiles. From
these observed maximum disk M/L ratios we conclude that a Salpeter IMF
has too many low-mass stars per unit luminosity but that an IMF similar
to the Salpeter IMF at the high-mass end with less low-mass stars
(giving stellar M/L ratios 30\% lower than the Salpeter value) is
consistent with the maximum disk constraints. Trends in observed maximum
disk stellar M/L ratios with color provide a good match to the predicted
model relation, suggesting that the spiral galaxy stellar IMF is
universal and that a fraction of (particularly high surface brightness)
spiral galaxies may be close to maximum disk. We apply the model trends
in stellar M/L ratio with color to the Tully-Fisher (T-F) relation. We
find that the stellar mass T-F relation is relatively steep, has modest
scatter, and is independent of the passband and color used to derive the
stellar masses, again lending support for a universal IMF. The
difference in slope between the optical (especially blue) and
near-infrared T-F relations is due to the combined effects of dust
attenuation and stellar M/L variations with galaxy mass. Assuming the
Hubble Space Telescope Key Project distance to the Ursa Major Cluster
and neglecting the (uncertain) molecular gas fraction, we find that the
baryonic T-F relation takes the form M_{baryon}\~{}V^{3.5}
(with random and systematic 1 {$\sigma$} slope errors of \~{}0.2 each) when
using a bisector fit and rotation velocities derived from the flat part
of the rotation curve. Since we have normalized the stellar M/L ratios
to be as high as can possibly be allowed by maximum disk constraints,
the slope of the baryonic T-F relation will be somewhat shallower than
3.5 if all disks are substantially submaximal.

smaller than those derived from other approximations. This new law shows
several advantages: it represents well the intensity distribution, the
flux is conserved with high accuracy and it permits the use of a single
law for the whole HR Diagram since the bi-parametric laws are only
marginally valid in certain ranges of effective temperatures. The
limb-darkening coefficients are computed for the 12 commonly used
photometric bands u v b y U B V R I J H K. Bolometric and monochromatic
calculations are also available. The computations are presented for 19
metallicities ranging from 10^{-5} up to 10^{+1} solar
abundances, with log g varying between 0 and 5.0 and effective
temperatures between 2000 K-50000 K. Results for microturbulent
velocities of 0, 1, 2, 4, 8 km/s are also available. With this set of
data it was possible to investigate, for the first time, the influence
of such parameters in the limb-darkening. Limb-brightening, instead of
limb-darkening, was detected for some models. It is shown that the
limb-darkening coefficients derived using the Flux Conservation Method
(FCM) do not describe very well the intensity distribution, mainly near
the border of the disk. On the contrary, the present coefficients, based
on the LSM, represent very well the function I({$\mu$}) at any part of the
disk for any filter or wavelength, log g, effective temperature,
metallicity and microturbulent velocity. The results are presented in 46
tables for the 12 filters (bolometric) and can be retrieved from the
CDS. Due to the size of the remaining tables, mainly the monochromatic,
these are available only on request (CD ROMs). Tables 1-47 are available
in electronic form at the CDS via anonymous ftp to cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr

down their cooling. Comparison is made in optical and infrared
color-magnitude diagrams with recent late-M and L dwarf observations.
The saturation in optical colors and the very red near-infrared colors
of these objects are well explained by the onset of dust formation in
the atmosphere. Comparison of the faintest presently observed L dwarfs
with these dusty evolutionary models suggests that dynamical processes
such as turbulent diffusion and gravitational settling are taking place
near the photosphere. As the effective temperature decreases below
T_{eff}\~{}1300-1400 K, the colors of these objects move to very
blue near-infrared colors, a consequence of the ongoing methane
absorption in the infrared. We suggest the possibility of a brown dwarf
dearth in J, H, and K color-magnitude diagrams around this temperature.

Observatory (ISO) ISOPHOT. Five of the eight galaxies are detected in
both wave bands, and these data are used, in conjunction with IRAS
archival photometry, to model the dust emission at {$\lambda$}{\gt}\~{}40
{$\mu$}m. The FIR spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are best fitted by a
combination of two modified Planck functions, with T\~{}40-55 K (warm dust)
and T\~{}20-23 K (cool dust) and with a dust emissivity index {$\epsilon$}=2.
The cool dust can be a major contributor to the FIR emission of
starburst galaxies, representing up to 60\% of the total flux. This
component is heated not only by the general interstellar radiation
field, but also by the starburst itself. The cool dust mass is up to
\~{}150 times larger than the warm dust mass, bringing the gas-to-dust
ratios of the starbursts in our sample close to Milky Way values, once
rescaled for the appropriate metallicity. The ratio between the total
dust FIR emission in the range 1-1000 {$\mu$}m and the IRAS FIR emission in
the range 40-120 {$\mu$}m is \~{}1.75, with small variations from galaxy to
galaxy. This ratio is about 40\% larger than previously inferred from
data at millimeter wavelengths. Although the galaxies in our sample are
generally classified as ``UV bright,'' for four of them the UV energy
emerging shortward of 0.2 {$\mu$}m is less than 15\% of the FIR energy. On
average, about 30\% of the bolometric flux is coming out in the
UV-to-near-IR wavelength range; the rest is emitted in the FIR. Energy
balance calculations show that the FIR emission predicted by the dust
reddening of the UV-to-near-IR stellar emission is within a factor of \~{}2
of the observed value in individual galaxies and within 20\% when
averaged over a large sample. If our sample of local starbursts is
representative of high-redshift (z{\gt}\~{}1), UV-bright, star-forming
galaxies, these galaxies' FIR emission will be generally undetected in
submillimeter surveys, unless (1) their bolometric luminosity is
comparable to or larger than that of ultraluminous FIR galaxies and (2)
their FIR SED contains a cool dust component. Based on observations with

populations of local elliptical galaxies as determined from their
integrated spectra. The goal of the series is to determine the star
formation and chemical evolution histories of present-day elliptical
galaxies. The primary galaxy sample analyzed is that of Gonz{\'a}lez,
which consists of 39 elliptical galaxies drawn primarily from the local
field and nearby groups, plus the bulge of Messier 31. Single-burst
stellar population (SSP)-equivalent ages, metallicities, and abundance
ratios are derived from H{$\beta$}, Mg b, and {\lt}Fe{\gt} line strengths
using an extension of the Worthey models that incorporates nonsolar
line-strength ``response functions'' by Tripicco {\amp} Bell. These
functions account for changes in the Lick/IDS indices caused by nonsolar
abundance ratios, allowing us to correct the Worthey models for the
enhancements of Mg and other {$\alpha$}-like elements relative to the
Fe-peak elements. SSP-equivalent ages of the Gonz{\'a}lez elliptical
galaxies are found to vary widely, 1.5 Gyr{\lt}\~{}t{\lt}\~{}18 Gyr, while
metallicities [Z/H] and enhancement ratios [E/Fe] are strongly peaked
around {\lt}[Z/H]{\gt}=+0.26 and {\lt}[E/Fe]{\gt}=+0.20 (in an aperture of
radius r_{e}/8). The enhancement ratios [E/Fe] are milder than
previous estimates because of the application of nonsolar abundance
corrections to both Mg b and {\lt}Fe{\gt} for the first time. While [E/Fe]
is usually greater than zero, it is not the ``E'' elements that are
actually enhanced but rather the Fe-peak elements that are depressed;
this serves not only to weaken {\lt}Fe{\gt} but also to strengthen Mg b,
accounting for the overall generally mild enhancements. Based on index
strengths from the Lick/IDS galaxy library (Trager et al.), C is not
depressed with Fe but rather seems to be on a par with other elements
such as Mg in the E group. Gradients in stellar populations within
galaxies are found to be mild, with SSP-equivalent age increasing by
25\%, metallicity decreasing by {\lt}[Z/H]{\gt}=0.20 dex, and [E/Fe]
remaining nearly constant out to an aperture of radius r_{e}/2
for nearly all systems. Our ages have an overall zero-point uncertainty
of at least \~{}25\% because of uncertainties in the stellar evolution
prescription, the oxygen abundance, the effect of [E/Fe]{\ne}0 on the
isochrones, and other unknowns. However, the relative age rankings of
stellar populations should be largely unaffected by these errors. In
particular, the large spread in ages appears to be real and cannot be
explained by contamination of H{$\beta$} by blue stragglers or
hot horizontal-branch stars, or by fill-in of H{$\beta$} by
emission. Correlations between these derived SSP-equivalent parameters
and other galaxy observables will be discussed in future papers.

 abstract = "{The Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 of the Hubble Space Telescope has been
used to obtain high-resolution images of NGC 4038/4039 that go roughly 3
mag deeper in V than previous observations made during cycle 2. These
new images allow us to measure the luminosity functions (LFs) of
clusters and stars over a range of 8 mag (-14{\lt}M\_V{\lt}-6). To first
order, the LF is a power law, with exponent {$\alpha$}=-2.12+/-0.04.
However, using a variety of different techniques to decouple the cluster
and stellar LFs, which overlap in the range -9{\lt}\~{}M\_V{\lt}\~{}-6, we find
an apparent bend in the young cluster LF at approximately M\_V=-10.4.
Brightward of this magnitude the LF has a power-law exponent
{$\alpha$}=-2.6+/-0.2, while faintward the slope is {$\alpha$}=-1.7+/-0.2. The
bend corresponds to a mass \~{}1x10\^{}5 M\_solar, only slightly lower than the
characteristic mass of globular clusters in the Milky Way (\~{}2x10\^{}5
M\_solar). It is currently not feasible to determine the cluster LF
fainter than M\_V\~{}-8, where individual stars are likely to dominate. The
stellar LF in the range -9{\lt}M\_V{\lt}-6 is much steeper, with
{$\alpha$}=-2.9+/-0.1, and is dominated by young red and blue supergiants.
The star clusters of the Antennae appear slightly resolved, with median
effective radii of 4+/-1 pc, similar to or perhaps slightly larger than
those of globular clusters in our Galaxy. However, the radial extents of
some of the very young clusters (ages less than 10 Myr) are much larger
than those of old globular clusters (e.g., the outer radius of knot S
exceeds 450 pc). This may indicate that the tidal forces from the
galaxies have not had time to remove some of the outer stars from the
young clusters. A combination of the UBVI colors, H{$\alpha$} morphology,
and Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph (GHRS) spectra enables us to
age date the clusters in different regions of the Antennae. Star
clusters around the edge of the dust overlap region appear to be the
youngest, with ages {\lt}\~{}5 Myr, while clusters in the western loop
appear to be 5-10 Myr old. Many star clusters in the northeastern star
formation region appear to be \~{}100 Myr old, with an LF in V that has
shifted faintward by \~{}1.0 mag relative to the younger (0-20 Myr)
clusters that dominate over most of the rest of the galaxy. A third
cluster population consists of intermediate-age clusters (\~{}500 Myr) that
probably formed during the initial encounter responsible for ejecting
the tails. A handful of old globular clusters from the progenitor
galaxies are also identified. Most of these lie around NGC 4039, where
the lower background facilitates their detection. Age estimates derived
from GHRS spectroscopy yield 3+/-1 Myr for knot K (just south of the
nucleus of NGC 4038) and 7+/-1 Myr for knot S in the western loop, in
good agreement with ages derived from the UBVI colors. Effective gas
outflow velocities from knots S and K are estimated to be about 25-30 km
s\^{}-1, based on the above cluster ages and the sizes of the surrounding
H{$\alpha$} bubbles. However, the measured widths of the interstellar
absorption lines suggest dispersion velocities of \~{}400 km s\^{}-1 along the
lines of sight to knots S and K.

an apparent magnitude of I\_AB=25.0. Spectroscopic redshifts in the range
3.61{\lt}=z{\lt}=4.81 have been obtained for 48 of these galaxies; their
median redshift is {\lt}z{\gt}=4.13. Selecting these galaxies in a manner
entirely analogous to our large survey for Lyman-break galaxies at
smaller redshift (2.7{\lt}\~{}z{\lt}\~{}3.4) allows a relatively clean
differential comparison between the populations and integrated
luminosity density at these two cosmic epochs. Over the same range of UV
luminosity, the spectroscopic properties of the galaxy samples at z\~{}4
and z\~{}3 are indistinguishable, as are the luminosity function shapes and
the total integrated UV luminosity densities
[rho\_UV(z=3)/rho\_UV(z=4)=1.1+/-0.3]. We see no evidence at these bright
magnitudes for the steep decline in the star formation density inferred
from fainter photometric Lyman-break galaxies in the Hubble deep field
(HDF). The HDF provides the only existing data on Lyman-break galaxy
number densities at fainter magnitudes. We have reanalyzed the z\~{}3 and
z\~{}4 Lyman-break galaxies in the HDF using our improved knowledge of the
spectral energy distributions of these galaxies, and we find, like
previous authors, that faint Lyman-break galaxies appear to be rarer at
z\~{}4 than z\~{}3. This might signal a large change in the faint-end slope of
the Lyman-break galaxy luminosity function between redshifts z\~{}3 and
z\~{}4, or, more likely, be due to significant variance in the number
counts within the small volumes probed by the HDF at high redshifts
(\~{}160 times smaller than the ground-based surveys discussed here). If
the true luminosity density at z\~{}4 is somewhat higher than implied by
the HDF, as our ground-based sample suggests, then the emissivity of
star formation as a function of redshift would appear essentially
constant for all z{\gt}1 once internally consistent corrections for dust
are made. This suggests that there may be no obvious peak in star
formation activity and that the onset of substantial star formation in
galaxies might occur at z{\gt}\~{}4.5.

to identify a significant population of dust-enshrouded starburst

poststarburst population. We present the differences between the field

morphological properties of the distant cluster galaxies, exploring the

 abstract = "{We present a review of nucleosynthesis in AGB stars outlining the
development of theoretical models and their relationship to
observations. We focus on the new high resolution codes with improved
opacities, which recently succeeded in accounting for the third
dredge-up. This opens the possibility of understanding low luminosity C
stars (enriched in s-elements) as the normal outcome of AGB evolution,
characterized by production of 12C and neutron-rich nuclei in the He
intershell and by mass loss from strong stellar winds. Neutron captures
in AGB stars are driven by two reactions: 13C([{$\alpha$}],n)16O, which
provides the bulk of the neutron flux at low neutron densities (Nn
[{\lt}=] 107 n/cm3), and 22Ne([{$\alpha$}],n)25Mg, which is mildly activated
at higher temperatures and mainly affects the production of s-nuclei
depending on reaction branchings. The first reaction is now known to
occur in the radiative interpulse phase, immediately below the region
previously homogenized by third dredge-up. The second reaction occurs
during the convective thermal pulses. The resulting nucleosynthesis
phenomena are rather complex and rule out any analytical approximation
(exponential distribution of neutron fluences). Nucleosynthesis in AGB
stars, modeled at different metallicities, account for several
observational constraints, coming from a wide spectrum of sources:
evolved red giants rich in s-elements, unevolved stars at different
metallicities, presolar grains recovered from meteorites, and the
abundances of s-process isotopes in the solar system. In particular, a
good reproduction of the solar system main component is obtained as a
result of Galactic chemical evolution that mixes the outputs of AGB
stars of different stellar generations, born with different
metallicities and producing different patterns of s-process nuclei. The
main solar s-process pattern is thus not considered to be the result of
a standard archetypal s-process occurring in all stars. Concerning the
13C neutron source, its synthesis requires penetration of small amounts
of protons below the convective envelope, where they are captured by the
abundant 12C forming a 13C-rich pocket. This penetration cannot be
modeled in current evolutionary codes, but is treated as a free
parameter. Future hydrodynamical studies of time dependent mixing will
be required to attack this problem. Evidence of other insufficiencies in
the current mixing algorithms is common throughout the evolution of low
and intermediate mass stars, as is shown by the inadequacy of stellar
models in reproducing the observations of CNO isotopes in red giants and
in circumstellar dust grains. These observations require some
circulation of matter between the bottom of convective envelopes and
regions close to the H-burning shell (cool bottom processing). AGB stars
are also discussed in the light of their possible contribution to the
inventory of short-lived radioactivities that were found to be alive in
the early solar system. We show that the pollution of the protosolar
nebula by a close-by AGB star may account for concordant abundances of
26Al, 41Ca, 60Fe, and 107Pd. The AGB star must have undergone a very
small neutron exposure, and be of small initial mass ([Image]). There is
a shortage of 26Al in such models, that however remains within the large
uncertainties of crucial reaction rates. The net 26Al production problem
requires further investigation.

total area of \~{} 480 arcmin(2) , corresponding to \~{} 1 pc(2) at a distance
of 160 pc, and includes the DCO() +$\}$+ dense cores Oph-A, Oph-B1, Oph-B2,
Oph-C, Oph-D, Oph-E, and Oph-F. Our mosaic is sensitive to features down
to N\_H2 \~{} 10(22) cm(-2) in column density. It is consistent with, but
goes significantly deeper than, previous dust continuum studies of the
cloud. For the first time, compact circumstellar dusty structures around
young stellar objects are detected simultaneously with more extended
emission from the dense cores and the ambient cloud. Thus, it becomes
possible to directly study the genetic link between dense cores and
young stars. The diffuse cloud emission is itself fragmented in at least
58 small-scale, starless clumps harboring no infrared or radio continuum
sources in their centers. Most of these starless fragments are probably
gravitationally bound and pre-stellar in nature. Nineteen of them
exhibit a relatively flat inner intensity profile, indicating they are
not as centrally condensed as the envelopes seen around the embedded
(Class I and Class 0) protostars of the cloud. Ten other clumps appear
to be sharply peaked, however, and may represent candidate `isothermal
protostars', i.e., collapsing cloud fragments which have not yet
developed a central hydrostatic core. The \~{} 6 000 AU fragmentation
sizescale estimated from our rho Oph 1.3 mm mosaic is consistent with
the typical Jeans length in the DCO() +$\}$+ cores and is at least five
times smaller than the diameter of isolated dense cores in the Taurus
cloud. In agreement with this short lengthscale for fragmentation, the
circumstellar envelopes surrounding rho Oph Class I and Class 0
protostars are observed to have finite sizes and to be significantly
more compact than their Taurus counterparts. The measured frequency
distribution of pre-stellar clump masses is relatively shallow below \~{}
0.5 M\_sun , being consistent with Delta N/Delta m \~{} m(-1.5) , but
steepens to Delta N/Delta m \~{} m(-2.5) above \~{} 0.5 M\_sun . This is
reminiscent of the stellar initial mass function (IMF), suggesting the
clumps we detect may be the direct progenitors of individual stars. Our
observations therefore support theoretical scenarios in which
gravitational fragmentation plays a key role in determining the stellar
mass scale and the IMF. Finally, the presence of several remarkable
alignments of young stars and starless clumps in the 1.3 mm dust
continuum mosaic supports the idea that various external agents, such as
a slow shock wave originating in the Sco OB2 association, have induced
core fragmentation and star formation in at least part of the cloud.

High-redshift galaxies may, however, emit most of their energy at
submillimetre wavelengths, if they contain substantial amounts of dust
that absorbs the starlight and reradiates it as far-infrared light. Here
we report a deep survey of a blank region of sky, performed at
submillimetre wavelengths (450 and 850{$\mu$}m). We detect luminous sources
in the 850-{$\mu$}m band which, if they have similar spectra to
low-redshift ultraluminous infrared galaxies and are primarily powered
by star formation, must each be converting more than 100 solar masses of
gas per year into stars: this is larger than themaximum star-formation
rates inferred for most optically selected galaxies. The total amount of
star formation at high redshifts is essentially fixed by the level of
background light, but where the peak activity occurs at submillimetre
wavelengths is not yet well established. However, the background light
inferred from the sources that we have detected is already comparable to
that from the optically selected sources. Establishing the main epoch of
star formation will therefore require a combination of optical and

have been interpreted as indicating that the peak of star formation

formation takes place in dense clouds, and is often hidden at optical
wavelengths because of extinction by dust in the clouds. Here we report
a deep submillimetre-wavelength survey of the Hubble Deep Field; these
wavelengths trace directly the emission from dust that has been warmed
by massive star-formation activity. The combined radiation of the five
most significant detections accounts for 30-50 per cent of the
previously unresolved background emission in this area. Four of these
sources appear to be galaxies in the redshift range 2{\lt} z {\lt} 4,
which, assuming these objects have properties comparable to local
dust-enshrouded starburst galaxies, implies a star-formation rate during

Instead, the central core of the cluster accretes from the surrounding

intermediate-mass stars that have formed through accretion on to
low-mass protostars. Once a sufficiently massive star has formed to
expel the remaining gas, the cluster expands in accordance with this
loss of mass, halting further collisions. This process implies a
critical stellar density for the formation of massive stars, and a high
rate of binaries formed by tidal capture.

tracing the evolution with cosmic time of the galaxy luminosity density,
as determined from several deep spectroscopic samples and the Hubble
Deep Field (HDF) imaging survey. In a q0 = 0.5, h50 = 1 cosmology, the
global spectrophotometric properties of field galaxies can be well
fitted by a simple stellar evolution model, defined by a time-dependent
star formation rate (SFR) per unit comoving volume and a universal
initial mass function (IMF) extending from 0.1 to 125 M{\.o}. While a
Salpeter IMF with a modest amount of dust reddening or a somewhat
steeper mass function, phi (m) \~{} m-2.7, can both reproduce the data
reasonably well, a Scalo IMF produces too much long-wavelength light and
is unable to match the observed mean galaxy colors. In the best-fit
models, the global SFR rises sharply, by about an order of magnitude,
from a redshift of zero to a peak value at z \~{} 1.5 in the range
0.12-0.17 M{\.o} yr-1 Mpc-3, to fall again at higher redshifts. After
integrating the inferred star formation rate over cosmic time, we find a

types. The models are able to account for the entire background light
recorded in the galaxy counts down to the very faint magnitude levels
probed by the HDF. Since only \~{}20\% of the current stellar content of
galaxies is produced at z {\gt} 2, a rather low cosmic metallicity is
expected at these early times, in good agreement with the observed
enrichment history of the damped Ly alpha systems. The biggest
uncertainty is represented by the poorly constrained amount of starlight
that was absorbed by dust and reradiated in the IR at early epochs. A
''monolithic collapse'' model, where half of the present-day stars formed
at z {\gt} 2.5 and were shrouded by dust, can be made consistent with the
global history of light, but overpredicts the metal mass density at high
redshifts as sampled by quasi-stellar object absorbers.

fireball rather than a clean one. A specific speculative example of such

We demonstrate that incorporating the near-infrared data reduces the

required to remove systematic uncertainties within the redshift range 1

evolution of the comoving ultraviolet (2800 A) luminosity density
(presumed to be proportional to the global star formation rate) from a
redshift of z = 0.5 to z = 2. We find that the global star formation
rate increases rapidly with redshift, rising by a factor of 12 from a
redshift of zero to a peak at z \~{} 1.5. For redshifts beyond 1.5, it
decreases monotonically. Our measures of the star formation rate are
consistent with those found by Lilly et al. from the Canada-France
Redshift Survey at z {\lt} 1 and by Madau et al. from Lyman break
galaxies at z {\gt} 2, and they bridge the redshift gap between those two
samples. The overall star formation or metal enrichment rate history is
consistent with the theoretical models of White and Frenk and the
predictions of Pei and Fall based on the evolving H I content of Ly
alpha QSO absorption line systems.

    pages = {1733-1768},
 abstract = "{We report on the first phase of a study of the stellar population
comprising the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC). Approximately 50\% of the \~{}
3500 stars identified to date within \~{} 2.5 pc of the namesake Trapezium
stars are optically visible, and in this paper we focus on that sample
with I {\lt} 17.5 mag. The large number and number density
(n_{peak} {\gt} 10(4) pc(-3) ) of stars, the wide range in
stellar mass ( \~{} 0.1-50 M\_{\.o}), and the extreme youth ({\lt} 1-2 Myr)
of the stellar population, make the ONC the best site for investigating:
1) the detailed shape of a truly ``initial'' mass spectrum; 2) the
apparent age spread in a region thought to have undergone triggered star
formation; 3) the time sequence of star formation as a function of
stellar mass; and 4) trends of all of the above with cluster radius.
Nearly 60\% of the \~{} 1600 optical stars have sufficient data
(spectroscopy and photometry) for placement on a theoretical HR diagram;
this subsample is unbiased with respect to apparent brightness or
cluster radius, complete down to \~{} 1 M\_{\.o}, and representative of the
total optical sample below \~{} 1 M\_{\.o} for the age and extinction
ranges characteristic of the cluster. Comparison of the derived HR
diagram with traditional pre-main sequence evolutionary calculations
shows a trend of increasing stellar age with increasing stellar mass. To
avoid the implication of earlier characteristic formation times for
higher-mass stars than for lower-mass stars, refinement of early
evolutionary theory in a manner similar to the birthline hypothesis of
Palla {\amp} Stahler (1993), is required. Subject to uncertainties in the
tracks and isochrones, we can still investigate stellar mass and age
distributions in the ONC. We find the ONC as a whole to be characterized
by a mass spectrum which is not grossly inconsistent with ``standard''
stellar mass spectra. In particular, although there are structural
differences between the detailed ONC mass spectrum and various models
constructed from solar neighborhood data, the observed mass spectrum
appears to a peak at \~{} 0.2 M\_{\.o} and to fall off rapidly towards
lower masses; several substellar objects are present. The abundance of
low-mass stars relative to high-mass stars suggests that there is no
bi-modal star formation mode; somewhat ironically, the ONC probably
contains fractionally more low-mass stars than the solar neighborhood
since the population not yet located on the HR diagram is dominated by
sub-solar-mass stars. Nonetheless, the ONC mass spectrum is biased
towards higher-mass stars within the innermost cluster radii
(r_{projected} {\lt} 0.3 pc). We find the ONC as a whole to be
characterized by a mean age of {\lt} 1 Myr and an age spread which is
probably less than 2 Myr, but also by a bias towards younger stars at
smaller projected cluster radii. Although the most massive stars and the
youngest stars are found preferentially towards the center of the ONC it
does not follow that the most massive stars are the youngest stars. A
lower limit to the total cluster mass in stars is M_{stars} \~{}
900 M\_{\.o} (probably a factor of {\lt} 2 underestimate). A lower limit
to the recent star formation rate is \~{} 10(-4) M\_{\.o} yr(-1) . All
observational data in this study as well as stellar parameters derived
from them are available in electronic format.

surprisingly elusive in field galaxy redshift surveys; quantification of
their surface densities and morphologies is crucial for determining how
and when galaxies formed. The Hubble Deep Field (HDF) observations offer
the opportunity to exploit the ubiquitous effect of intergalactic
absorption and obtain useful statistical constraints on the redshift
distribution of galaxies to considerably fainter limits than the current
spectroscopic limits. We model the HI cosmic opacity as a function of
redshift, including scattering in resonant lines of the Lyman series and
Lyman continuum absorption, and use stellar population synthesis models
with a wide variety of ages, metallicities, dust contents and redshifts
to derive colour selection criteria that provide a robust separation

relatively small IUE aperture, the galaxy stellar populations are well

can be applied to the classification of high- redshift galaxies and to
the identification of the host galaxies of quasars. The templates
predict that observed magnitudes from traditional ground-based
photometric surveys can be uniquely interpreted. For example, U, B, and
I magnitudes uniquely determine both the redshift and the morphological
type of a galaxy. The template spectra are also used to calculate
K-corrections for galaxies as a function of morphological type and
redshift, up to z = 2. These improved K-corrections are not sufficient
to explain the excess counts in faint blue galaxies. A subset of our

density is approximately half that of luminous (L {\gt}\~{} L*) present-day
galaxies. Our sample of z {\gt} 3 galaxies is large enough that we can
begin to detail the spectroscopic characteristics of the population as a
whole. The spectra of the z {\gt} 3 galaxies are remarkably similar to
those of nearby star-forming galaxies, the dominant features being
strong low-ionization interstellar absorption lines and high-ionization
stellar lines, often with P Cygni profiles characteristic of Wolf-Rayet

We assign approximate mass scales to the galaxies using the strengths of
the heavily saturated interstellar features and find that, if the line
widths are dominated by gravitational motions within the galaxies, the
implied velocity dispersions are 180 km s-1 {\lt}= sigma {\lt}= 320 km

8.5 h\^{}$\{$-2$\}$_{50} M{\.o} yr-1 being typical. Together with the
morphological properties of the z {\gt} 3 galaxy population, which we
discuss in a companion paper, all of these findings strongly suggest
that we have identified the high-redshift counterparts of the spheroid

with the Hubble Space Telescope using the Faint Object Camera. The
galaxies range in morphology from blue compact dwarfs to ultraluminous
merging far-infrared galaxies. Our data combined with new and archival
UV spectroscopy and far-infrared fluxes allow us to dissect the anatomy
of starbursts in terms of the distributions of stars, star clusters, and
dust. The overall morphology of starbursts is highly irregular, even
after excluding compact sources (clusters and resolved stars). The
irregularity is seen both in the isophotes and the surface brightness
profiles. In most cases the latter cannot be characterized by either
exponential or R\^{}0.25\^{} profiles. Most (7/9) starbursts are found to have
similar intrinsic effective surface brightnesses, suggesting that a
negative feedback mechanism is setting an upper limit to the star
formation rate per unit area. Assuming a continuous star formation rate
and a Salpeter [ApJ, 121,161(1955)] IMF slope, this surface brightness
corresponds to an areal star formation rate of 0.7 M\_sun\_ kpc\^{}-2\^{} yr\^{}-1\^{}
in stars in the mass range of 5-100 M\_sun\_. All starbursts in our sample
contaIn UV bright star clusters indicating that cluster formation is an
important mode of star formation in starbursts. On average about 20\% of
the UV luminosity comes from these clusters. The clusters with M\_220\_
{\lt}- 14 mag, or super star clusters (SSC) are preferentially found at
the very heart of starbursts; over 90\% of the SSCs are found where the
underlying surface brightness is within 1.5 mag arcsec\^{}-2\^{} of its peak
value. The size of the SSCs in the nearest host galaxies are consistent
with those of Galactic globular clusters. Our size estimates of more
distant SSCs are likely to be contaminated by neighboring clusters and
the underlying peaked high surface brightness background. The luminosity
function of SSCs is well represented by a power law [{\phis}(L) is
proportional to L^{alpha}\^{}] with a slope {$\alpha$} \~{} -2. We find a
strong correlation between the far-infrared excess and the UV spectral
slope for our sample and other starbursts with archival data. The
correlation is in the sense that as the UV color becomes redder, more
far-infrared flux is observed relative to the UV flux. The correlation
is well modeled by a geometry where much of their dust is in a
foreground screen near to the starburst, but not by a geometry of
well-mixed stars and dust. Some starbursts have noticeable dust lanes,
or completely obscured ionizing sources, indicating that the foreground
screen is not uniform but must have some patchiness. Nevertheless, the
reddened UV colors observed even in these cases indicates that the
foreground screen has a high covering factor and can account for a
significant fraction of the far-infrared flux.

m spectra and extract forbidden line profiles uncontaminated by
terrestrial night-sky emission, photospheric absorption lines, and

The veiling fluxes combined with existing infrared photometry allow us
to estimate reddenings and stellar luminosities for the first time for
heavily veiled stars. The new estimates of the stellar luminosities of
these objects indicate that the stars with the highest accretion rates
are the youngest in the sample.  There is a one-to-one correspondence
between forbidden line emission, veiling, and near-infrared color
excess among the stars in our sample; all disks around young stars

{$\lambda$}5577, - [S II] {$\lambda$}6731, and [N II] {$\lambda$}6583 represent
a range of critical densities from 10^{4} to 10^{8}
cm^{-3}.  We have determined luminosities and line ratios for
the two distinct velocity components in each of these forbidden
lines. The high-velocity component resembles a dense stellar jet but
requires more than a single shock to account for the observed line
ratios. Luminosities of the high-velocity component indicate mass-loss
rates of 10^{-8} to 10^{-10} M_{sun}
yr^{-1} for most stars and disk accretion rates derived from
the veiling fluxes are 10^{-6} to 10^{-8}
M_{sun} yr^{-1}. The mass outflow rates and mass
accretion rates are correlated. The ratio of mass outflow rate to the
mass accretion rate depends upon how the forbidden line luminosities
are interpreted but is probably {\tilde}0.01 for most classical T Tauri
stars.

The low-velocity component originates in a region of higher density
than the high-velocity component and is characterized by a small
negative radial velocity ({\tilde}-5 km s^{-1}), possibly
associated with a disk wind or magnetic accretion columns. The
velocity shifts are largest for forbidden lines with the lowest
critical density, suggesting that the low-velocity component
accelerates away from the surface of the disk. If the low-velocity
component arises on the surface of a disk in Keplerian rotation, then
the observed profiles imply a disk surface brightness which decreases
as {\tilde}r^{-2.2}.

 abstract = "{We describe new optically thin solutions for rotating accretion flows
around black holes and neutron stars. These solutions are advection
dominated, so that most of the viscously dissipated energy is advected
radially with the flow. We model the accreting gas as a
two-temperature plasma and include cooling by bremsstrahlung,
synchrotron, and Comptonization. We obtain electron temperatures
T_{e} 10^{8.5}-10^{10} K.

The new solutions are present only for mass accretion rates
M^{ṡ}_{crit} less than a critical rate A
crit which we calculate as a function of radius R and viscosity
parameter {$\alpha$}. For M^{ṡ} {\lt}
M^{ṡ}_{crit} we show that there are three
equilibrium branches of solutions. One of the branches corresponds to
a cool optically thick flow which is the well-known thin disk solution
of Shakura {\amp} Sunyaev Another branch corresponds to a hot optically
thin flow, discovered originally by Shapiro, Lightman, {\amp} Eardley
(SLE).  This solution is thermally unstable. The third branch
corresponds to our new advection-dominated solution. This solution is
hotter and more optically thin than the SLE solution but is viscously
and thermally stable. It is related to the ion torus model of Rees et
al. and may potentially explain the hard X-ray and {$\gamma$}-ray
emission from X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei.

For M^{ṡ} {\lt}
M^{ṡ}_{crit}, our work suggests that an
accretion flow can choose between two distinct states, namely, the
thin disk solution and the new advection-dominated solution, both of
which are apparently stable. We argue that, in certain circumstances,
it is only the latter solution that is truly stable, and that a thin
disk will spontaneously evaporate and convert itself into an
advection-dominated flow. Even for
M^{ṡ}_{crit} we suggest that a thin disk
may evaporate partially so that a fraction of the accretion occurs via
an advection-dominated hot corona. If these ideas are correct, then
optically thin advection-dominated flows must be very widespread,
possibly the most common form of sub-Eddington accretion in black
holes.

Our calculations indicate that advection-dominated accretion on black
holes differs considerably from similar flows around neutron
stars. The crucial physical difference, which has been mentioned
previously in the literature, is that in the former the advected
energy is lost into the hole, whereas in the latter it is thermalized
and re-radiated at the stellar surface, thereby providing soft photons
which can Compton-cool the accreting gas. We obtain
M^{ṡ}_{crit} {\tilde}
{$\alpha$}^{2}M^{ṡ}_{Edd} for
accreting black holes, independent of the black hole mass, whereas it
is {\tilde}0.1{$\alpha$}^{2}M^{ṡ}_{Edd}
for neutron stars. Advection-dominated accretion is therefore more
likely to occur in accreting black holes, and these systems will be
underluminous for their M^{ṡ} because the bulk of
the energy is advected into the hole rather than being radiated. We
find that T_{e} in accreting black hole flows rises up to
{\tilde}10^{9} 10^{10} K, compared to T_{e} {\tilde}
10^{8.5}-10^{9} K in neutron star systems. Spectra of
accreting black holes are therefore expected to be harder than those
of accreting neutron stars.  Pair effects are also more likely in black
hole systems, though only at higher A than those we consider.

 abstract = "{A radiative model for the soft gamma repeaters and the energetic 1979
March 5 burst is presented. We identify the sources of these bursts with
neutron stars the external magnetic fields of which are much stronger
than those of ordinary pulsars. Several independent arguments point to a
neutron star with B\_dipole\~{}5x10\^{}14 G as the source of the March 5 event.
A very strong field can (i) spin down the star to an 8-s period in the
\~{}10\^{}4-yr age of the surrounding supernova remnant N49; (ii) provide
enough energy for the March 5 event; (iii) undergo a large-scale
interchange instability the growth time of which is comparable to the
\~{}0.2-s width of the initial hard transient phase of the March 5 event;
(iv) confine the energy that was radiated in the soft tail of that
burst; (v) reduce the Compton scattering cross-section sufficiently to
generate a radiative flux that is \~{}10\^{}4 times the (non-magnetic)
Eddington flux; (vi) decay significantly in \~{}10\^{}4-10\^{}5 yr, as is
required to explain the activity of soft gamma repeater sources on this
time-scale; and (vii) power the quiescent X-ray emission L\_X\~{}7x10\^{}35 erg
s\^{}-1 observed by Einstein and ROSAT as it diffuses the stellar interior.
We propose that the 1979 March 5 event was triggered by a large-scale
reconnection/interchange instability of the stellar magnetic field, and
the soft repeat bursts by cracking of the crust. The hard initial spike
of the March 5 event is identified with an expanding pair fireball, and
the soft tail of that burst, together with the short, soft repeat
bursts, with a pair plasma trapped in the stellar magnetosphere. We
construct a detailed radiative model that describes the cooling of such
a plasma. The opacity is dominated by the electron-baryon contaminant in
a cold surface layer, and the plasma releases energy as the edge of the
pair-dominated region propagates inward, in a cooling wave. The rate at
which the plasma volume contracts is limited either by the rate of
advection of heat toward the stellar surface (where the field is
strongest and the scattering opacity weakest), or by ablation of ions
and electrons from the stellar surface. The effective temperature of the
surface radiation depends only on the surface magnetic field strength in
the regime where the radiative flux is limited by ablation from the
neutron star surface (which is the regime of interest in the March 5
event), and otherwise is weakly dependent on the plasma energy density.
We argue that the deposition of equivalent energy in a much weaker
magnetic field (characteristic of ordinary pulsars) necessarily
generates a very high scattering depth which chokes off the radiative
flow on the observed \~{}0.1-s time-scale of soft gamma repeater bursts.
Indeed, we suggest that the same basic magnetospheric emission mechanism
operates at lower field strengths (B\~{}10\^{}12 G) in Type II X-ray bursts,
which have much lower luminosities than soft gamma repeater bursts.
Important magnetic radiative effects include the suppression of Compton
scattering in the extraordinary polarization mode, and stimulated photon
splitting. We derive the Boltzmann equations for the photon occupation
number which describe simulated photon splitting, as well as photon
merging. We show that the net splitting rate vanishes in thermal
equilibrium. Radiative diffusion occurs primarily in the E-mode,
although rapid scattering of the O-mode ensures convergence of the
photon distribution function to a Bose-Einstein form. This allows us to
write down diffusion equations for the photon energy flux and number
flux as linear superpositions of gradients in the temperature and
chemical potential. The transition from a Planck to a Bose-Einstein
spectrum occurs at T\~{}10 keV. Photon splitting at higher temperatures can
impede free-streaming of photons across the magnetic field lines, but
splitting of high-energy photons is impeded by the inverse process of
photon merging. We demonstrate that only a small fraction of the pair
bubble energy can be conducted into the crust during the lifetime of the
burst. We discuss the radiative ablation of matter from the heated
stellar surface after the magnetospheric pair plasma is dissipated. The
ensuing surface afterglow is typically \~{}1 per cent of the burst
luminosity. Direct pair neutrino cooling of the plasma is shown to be
unimportant for soft gamma repeater bursts, but may help to determine
the light curve of the March 5 event. Finally, we make a critical
comparison between this model and models in which the soft gamma
repeater bursts are triggered by accretion and/or involve surface
cooling.

the Wide Field Camera of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) are presented.
NGC 4038/4039, nicknamed The Antennae, is a prototypical example of a
pair of colliding galaxies believed to be at an early stage of a merger.
Down to the limiting magnitude of V approximately 23 mag, the HST images
reveal a population of over 700 blue pointlike objects within the disks.
The mean absolute magnitude of these objects is M_{V} = -11 mag,
with the brightest objects reaching M_{V} approximately -15.
Their mean apparent color indices ar U - V = -0.7 mag and V - 1 = 0.8
mag on the Johnson UVI passband system, while their mean indices
corrected for internal reddening are (u - v)_{0} = -1.0 mag and
(V - I_{0} = 0.5. Their mean effective radius, determined from
slightly resolved images, is 18 pc (for H_{0} = 50 km/s /Mpc).
Based on their luminosities and resolution, most of these objects cannot
be individual stars, but are likely young compact star clusters. The
brighter ones are similar to the objects found in NGC 1275 and NGC 7252,
which appear to be young globular clusters formed during recent galazy
mergers. Based on their U - V and V - I colors, the brightest, bluest
clusters of NGC 4038/4039 appear to be less than 10 Myr old. Most of
these bright clusters are relatively tightly clustered themselves, with
typically a dozen individual clusters belonging to a complex identified
as a giant H II region from ground-based observations. The cluster
luminosity function (LF) is approximately a power law, phi(L)dL
proportional to L^{-1.78+/-0.05}dL, with no hint of a turnover
at fainter magnitudes. This power-law shape agrees with the LF of
Magellanic Cloud clusters and Galactic open clusters, but differs from
the LF of old globular cluster systems that is typically Gaussian with a
Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of approximately 3 mag. Besides the
blue clusters, we also find about a dozen extremely red objects with V -
I greater than 3.0. The highest number density of these red objects is
found in the SE quadrant, where star formation appears to be most
recent. We propose that these objects may be very young star clusters
still embedded in their placental dust cocoons.

factor of 2-3 relative to the Scalo solar neighborhood IMF. We have used
published surface photometry of spiral galaxies to analyze the star
formation histories of disks independent of their bulge properties. The
ratio of the current star formation rate (SFR) to the average past rate
increases from of order 0.01 in Sa galaxies to 1 in Sc-Irr disks. This
confirms that the pronounced change in the photometric properties of
spiral galaxies along the Hubble sequence is predominantly due to
changes in the star formation histories of disks, and only secondarily
to changes in the bulge/disk ratio. A comparison of current SFRs and gas
masses of the sample yields median timescales for gas consumption of
approximately 3 Gyr, in the absence of stellar recycling. However, a
proper time-dependent treatment of the gas return from stars shows that
recycling extends the gas lifetimes of disks by factors of 1.5-4 for
typical disk parameters. Consequently the current SFRs in many (but not
all) disks can be sustained for periods comparable to the Hubble time.

We present radiative Rosseland mean opacities for envelopes obtained

approximation, ionization equilibria and level populations in
envelopes depend only on the temperature T and electron density
N_{e} and are insensitive to chemical mixtures. Monochromatic
opacities for all abundant chemical elements are therefore calculated
on a grid of (T, N_{e}) values and are archived.  Rosseland
mean opacities are then readily calculated for any chemical
mixture. Tables of Rosseland means, for any required mixtures and as
functions of {$\rho$} and T, are available on request in
computer-readable form.

The present, op, results are compared with those from another recent
study, referred to as OPAL, by C. A. Iglesias and F. A. Rogers at the

nearby companion stars shorten the accretion time scale in multiple star
systems, thereby accounting for the presence of WTTS that are coeval
with many CTTS. The binary star frequency in the projected linear
separation range 16 to 252 AU for T Tauri stars (60 (+/- 17)\%) is a
factor of 4 greater than that of the solar-type main-sequence stars
(16(+/- 3)\%). Given the limited separation range of this survey, the
rate at which binaries are detected suggests that most, if not all, T
Tauri stars have companions. We propose that the observed overabundance
of companions of T Tauri stars is an evolutionary effect, in which
triple and higher order T Tauri stars are disrupted by close encounters
with another star or system of stars.

of helium and carbon are ejected into the interstellar medium before
being turned into heavier elements. The nucleosynthetic production is
found to depend very much on metallicity. Consideration is also given to
the consequences on the yields of various values of the lowest initial
mass limit M_{BH} for black hole formation, assuming that no or
little mass should be lost subsequently to the general relativistic
collapse. The yields in heavy elements strongly decrease with the
lowering of M_{BH,} since then more heavy elements are swallowed
up by black holes.

 abstract = "{We compare the emission-line and continuum properties of a set of 25
broad absorption line QSOs (BALQSOs) and 29 normal QSOs (i.e.,
non-BALQSOs), both taken from the Large Bright Quasar Survey (LBQS),
whose candidates were identified using the Cambridge Automatic Plate
Measuring Facility. The LBQS sample of 25 BALQSOs is augmented by an
additional 17 BALQSOs taken from other sources. We define a balnicity
index in order to separate the non-BALQSOs from the BALQSOs as
objectively as possible, as well as to provide a measure of the
strength of the broad absorption line features. The comparisons are
made by defining indices for various features, measuring them for each
object, and applying the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test to various
BALQSO and non-BALQSO samples. We also compare the BALQSOs and
non-BALQSOs by creating and comparing mean spectra for various
samples.

Our principal result is that the emission-line properties of
non-BALQSOs and BALQSOs are remarkably similar. A comparison of the
LBQS BALQSOs and non-BALQSOs reveals no statistically significant
differences. However, when the full set of BALQSOs and various
subsamples of the full set of BALQSOs are considered, we do find a
small N V enhancement in the BALQSOs relative to the non-BALQSOs. We
find enhanced emission around Al III {$\lambda$}1857, but comparison of
the mean spectrum of the BALQSOs to the mean spectrum of the
non-BALQSOs suggests that species other than Al III (probably Fe II
and/or Fe III) are responsible for the difference. We also find a
strong correlation between the strength of the Fe II emission and the
balnicity index.

We define an index which measures the degree of detachment of the
absorption trough. We find a weak anticorrelation between the
detachment index and the equivalent widths of the C III] and C IV
emission lines, but find no evidence of a correlation with this index
and the Fe II strength. We confirm recent work by Corbin on velocity
shifts between the peaks of Mg II, C III] and C IV: there is a small
blueward displacement of the C IV peak relative to the C III] peak
which is strongly correlated with the much larger blueward shift of C
IV relative to Mg II. However, in contrast to Corbin's results, we do
not find the shifts to be larger in the BALQSOs compared with the
non-BALQSOs. There is evidence for structure in the C IV absorption
troughs which has a velocity difference equal to that of the N V +
Ly{$\alpha$} velocity separation. This strongly suggests that radiation
pressure is important in the dynamics of the outflow. 

The continua of the BALQSOs and non-BALQSOs are remarkably similar,
with the striking exception of the relatively rare BALQSOs which show
strong Mg II and Al III absorption.  These objects are much redder in
the interval {\tilde}1550 {\AA} to {\tilde}2200 {\AA} than the other
BALQSOs and non-BALQSOs. They also show especially strong Fe II
emission, and evidence for Fe III emission much stronger than C III].


The close similarity between the emission-line and continuum
properties of BALQSOs and non-BALQSOs is consistent with the view that
BALQSOs do not form an intrinsically different class of objects from
non- BALQSOs.  We conclude that the small emission-line differences
between non-BALQSOs and BALQSOs are more likely due to a difference in
viewing angle, coupled with a mild anisotropy in the angular
distribution of the flux of the emission lines, and a selection effect
associated with a distribution of covering factors described by
Morris. The Mg n-Al III BALQSOs may belong to an extreme population of
objects where there is a large amount of obscuration present
accompanying large, and therefore self-shielding, column densities,
along with high electron densities.

disk does not develop an ordinary shear boundary layer in this case, one
can account for the observed UV excess and Balmer emission in terms of
the shocks that form at the bottom of the high-latitude magnetic
accretion columns on the stellar surface. This picture also provides a
natural explanation of some of the puzzling variability properties of
stars like DF Tau and RY Lup. YY Ori stars are interpreted as magnetic
TTS in which the observer's line of sight is roughly parallel to an

densities, but is only weakly correlated with the mean molecular gas

emission in 15 galaxies are used to define the relationship between the
SFR and gas surface density. In dense regions, the SFR and total gas
density are well-represented by a Schmidt power-law relation. This
Schmidt law breaks down, however, at densities below a critical
threshold value. Massive star formation is completely suppressed at
surface densities well below the threshold, while at densities near the
threshold value the slope of the SFR-density relation is much steeper
than a normal Schmidt law. A simple Toomre disk stability model predicts
threshold densities and radii which are in excellent agreement with

Key empirical facts about stellar systems are briefly reviewed, and the
ingredients needed to construct galaxy models are assembled, including
potential theory, stellar orbits, and the theory of the equilibrium
configurations of stellar systems. The stability of these configurations
and the theory of spiral structures are discussed. Collisions and
encounters between stellar systems are considered, and two-body
realization and the approach to statistical equilibrium in star clusters
are addressed. It is shown how the observable properties of galaxies
such as their luminosities and colors are changed by the aging of their
constituent stellar populations. Finally, it is shown that most of the
mass in the universe is locked up in some still invisible form.

into the disk in the process of the condensation of the mass from the
nebulosity. The magnetic twist, created by the rotation of the disk,
pushes out the mass by the j x B force as it relaxes towards the polar
directions, explaining the production of the large-scale cold bipolar
flows. On the other hand, the action of the magnetic field very close to
the star, including the mass transfer by magnetic reconnection and
angular momentum loss along the magnetic field lines, controls the final
fall of the accreted mass from the innermost edge of the disk to the
star. The free fall converts the potential energy into kinetic energy of
the infall and the latter into heat in the crash at the polar crowns of
the star, explaining the observed inflow of the gas and the presence of
the X-ray emitting regions near the stellar surface. The recoiling shock
may blow off the tail of the infalling mass along the field lines toward
the polar directions, explaining the observed outflow and the
small-scale warm high-velocity jets from the vicinity of the central

(typically tOO) have been obtained for a few halo dwarfs with the 3W6
CFH telescope. These solar type stars are very old and extremely metal
poor. The Li resonance line ( 6707) is observed, and is essentially
produced by the Li isotope. Although the mean metal abundance M/H varies
from a factor t2 to 250 relative to the Sun, the abundance of lithium is
very constant in all these stars, but the coolest ones where the
convection zone is deep enough to induce Li destruction by proton
fusion. The non-destruction of Li in very old halo stars (of about the
solar type) is to be attributed to the reduction of the size of the
convective zone, reduction caused by the very small abundance of the
heavy elements. If the problem seems clear for the halo stars it is on
the contrary very confusing in Population I stars. It seems however that
in the old disk stars the destruction of lithium is also inhibited,
probably also by a reduction of the depth of the convective zone due to
the slight metal deficiency. It is pointed out, on the other hand, that
among G type stars of Population I more than a half have a lithium
abundance similar to that of the Hyades, although probably not half of
them are as young as the Hyades. It is suggested that the destruction of
lithium in solar type stars is sometimes accelerated by the action of
another process such as overshooting or turbulent diffusion, which is
not always present. We admit that the shape of the distribution of Li
abundance in the Pleiades after Duncan (t98 t) rules out a significant
destruction of lithium in the protostellar phase for solar type stars.
Depletion of Lithium in halo stars by other processes is discussed and
found unlikely. After discussion it is suggested that the abundance of
lithium in halo dwarfs is therefore representative of the abundance of
the interstellar matter which formed the stars and also that this matter
itself retains the lithium abundances of the Big Bang, hardly altered.
We deduce a primordial value of the lithium abundance tt. (or, by = )
The baryonic density of the Universe deduced from this value is compared
to the densities deduced from the primordial abundance of deuterium and
helium. All these densities are small, and this show that the Universe
cannot be closed by nucleons. Key words: cosmology - stellar abundances
- galactic halo - galactic evolution

hole. It is shown that a centrifugally driven outflow of matter from the
disk is possible if the poloidal component of the magnetic field makes
an angle of less than 60 deg with disk surface. At large distances the
outflow forms a pair of collimated, antiparallel jets, while close to
the disk it is probably driven by gas pressure in a hot, magnetically
dominated corona.

the molecular clouds for which mass determinations are available reveals
essentially all of them to be gravitationally bound, and to
approximately satisfy the virial theorem. The observation of moderate
scatter in the dispersion-size relation is noted to imply that most
regions have not collapsed much since formation, suggesting that
processes of turbulent hydrodynamics have played an important role in
producing the observed substructures. A lower limit to the size of
subcondensations at which their internal motions are no longer
supersonic is shown to predict a minimum protostellar mass on the order
of a few tenths of a solar mass, while massive protostellar clumps are
found to develop complex internal structures, probably leading to the
formation of prestellar condensation nuclei. The observed turbulence of
molecular clouds is noted to imply lifetimes of less than 10 million

Two processes affecting the surface composition have been taken into

the deepest layers of the convective envelope. Mass loss due to the
stellar wind in the red-giant phase, and the envelope ejection leading
to the formation of planetary nebulae have been also taken into account.
In this way, several individual and collective properties of carbon
stars are predicted, as well as the expected compositions of planetary
nebulae, and the contribution of intermediate-mass stars to the galactic
nucleosynthesis of the nuclides listed above. The primary production of
C-13 and N-14 is also treated. A preliminary comparison with the
observations shows that the present theory is able to account for
several characteristics of carbon stars in the Galaxy, as well as in the
Magellanic Clouds, and in the dwarf elliptical galaxy in Fornax. The
theory accounts also for the observed range of helium abundances in

originated within transient protogalactic fragments that gradually lost

Normal galaxies have colors that are consistent with a monotonically

peculiar galaxies have a large scatter in colors that is consistent with
bursts as short as 20 million years involving up to about 5\% of the
total mass. Nearly all of this scatter is associated with galaxies
showing evidence of tidal interaction; moreover, interacting systems
that are at early stages of dynamical evolution, as inferred from the
absence of long tidal tails, have colors consistent with the most recent
bursts. These results provide evidence for a 'burst' mode of star
formation associated with violent dynamical phenomena.

magnitude less than the expected number of neutron stars and black holes
in binary systems. It is shown in the paper that the main condition for
the appearance of X-ray source in a binary system including relativistic
star is that the size of the normal component must be close to size of
its critical Roche lobe. In the case of accretion of the stellar wind
matter in detached binary system the specific angular momentum of the
matter captured by the relativistic star is small. Therefore the
accreting disk is not formed around relativistic star. Consequently, a
black hole in detached binary system can not be strong X-ray source (no
matter how strong the stellar wind might be). In this case the accretion
is spherically-symmetric and black hole is the source of hard X-ray and
y-ray radiation. Young neutron star in detached system is ejecting
pulsar, radiating in X-ray spectral band, like the Crab pulsar. Its
radioemission is absorbed in stellar wind plasma due to free-free
processes. Deceleration of the pulsar rotation and connected decrease of
its luminosity makes possible the penetration of the ambient plasma
inside light cylinder. This may lead to the switching off of the pulsar
mechanism. However rapidly rotating magnetosphere of the neutron star
throws away the falling matter, preventing the accretion. The rotation,
consequently, continues to decelerate. Only after sufficient
deceleration of neutron star rotation the accretion becomes possible and
neutron star will be the X-ray source. However the estimates show that
the deceleration time up to this stage exceeds the evolutionary time of
the normal component. Only in the extremely close binaries having
anomalously strong accreting matter flow it is possible for the
magnetized neutron star to convert into the X-ray sources. For the same
reason old single pulsars with strong magnetic field never become the
sources of ultra-violet and soft X-ray radiation. Key words: black holes
and neutron stars accretion X-ray sources pulsars

characterized by three parameters: a, which specifies the mass
distribution of stars at birth, p, the reciprocal decay time of an
assumed exponential decay in the rate of star formation, and their age.
The computations are based on theoretical evolutionary tracks for
individual stars. The models for which p are shown to give a
satisfactory account of the observed integrated colors of open clusters
as a function of age. The observed colors of Sc and Irr I galaxies are
found to be consistent with the following ideas. a) All galaxies are
approximately 10'' years old. b) An initial luminosity function
qualitatively similar to the Salpeter function obtains in all late-type
galaxies, but irregulars are somewhat more enriched in massive stars
than Sc's are. c) The mean rate of star formation, averaged over
sufficiently large regions of a galaxy and over sufficiently long times,
is a declining function of time. d) Different galaxies of the same
morphological type have very different decay times for star formation,
and many galaxies have experienced roughly uniform rates of star
formation for the last 10'' years. We propose that the range in colors of
the late-type galaxies reflects this range in decay times and point out
that, if so, the frequency of Type II supernovae will depend on both the
mass and the color of the parent galaxy. Finally we discuss the question
whether the bluest known galaxies, all of which are dwarfs, are young.
We tentatively conclude that, instead, they are galaxies which undergo
intermittent and unusually intense bursts of star formation. Subject

The particles in the region threaded by those field lines which close

close in a boundary zone near the supernova shell. Charged particles
escape along these lines and are electrostatically accelerated up to
energies of 3 X 1O'\~{} ZR63 B12 p-2 eV in the boundary zone. (Here, the

 abstract = "{Numerical calculations of the dynamics of a spherically symmetric
collapsing proto-star of one solar mass have been made for various
initial conditions. Calculations have also been made for masses of 2M0
and M o. In all cases the collapse is found to be extremely
non-homologous and is such that a very small part of the cloud's mass at
the centre reaches stellar densities and stops collapsing before most of
the cloud has had time to collapse very far. The stellar core thus
formed subsequently grows in mass as material falls into it, finally
becoming an ordinary star when all of the proto-stellar material has
been accreted. During most of this time the stellar core is completely
obscured by the dust in the infalling cloud, the absorbed radiation
reappearing in the infra-red as thermal emission from the dust grains.
The resulting star is almost a conventional Hayashi pre-main sequence
model, but it appears rather low on the Hayashi track. For masses much
greater than about 2M0 the convective Hayashi phase does not exist at
all. It appears that certain properties of T Tauri stars may find
explanation in the results of the present calculations. In an appendix
to the paper it is shown that limiting forms may be derived for the
density and velocity distributions near the centre of an isothermally
collapsing sphere. This may be shown to be possible also for a sphere
with a polytropic equation of state. Numerical results are presented for
the limiting solution in the isothermal case.

 abstract = "{Evolution from the main sequence to the red-giant phase is discussed for
Population I stars of mass M/Mo = 1,1.25, and 1 5. Prior to the giant
phase in all three stars, energy generation by the p-p chain reactions
dominates over energy generation by the CN cycle reactions. During the
main hydrogen- burning phase, a convective core is not present in the 1
Mo star but does occur in both the 1.25 Mo and 1.5 Mo stars. Over a
major portion of the main-sequence phase, the convective core grows in
both the 1.25 Mo and 1.5 Mo stars as the CN cycle reactions become
increasingly important. As each star rises along the red-giant branch,
the CN cycle reactions eventually become the major source of energy in
the hydrogen-burning shell. The time spent by a star burning hydrogen in
a thick shell relative to the time spent in the core hydrogen-burning
phase is found to be a strongly decreasing function of stellar mass.
Partially responsible for this mass dependence are three factors: (1)
for more massive stars, the mass fraction in the convective core, and
hence the mass over which hydrogen is exhausted at the end of the core
hydrogen-burning phase, is closer to the effective -Chandrasekhar limit;
(2) with decreasing stellar mass, the variation of hydrogen through the
shell becomes more gradual, and (3) with decreasing mass, electron
degeneracy becomes more important in the hydrogen-exhausted core during
the thick shell-burning phase. The latter two factors have the effect of
increasing the -Chandrasekhar limit. In contrast with the case of more
massive stars discussed in earlier papers of this series, electron
degeneracy is responsible for a major fraction of the pressure and
electron conduction is the major mode of energy flow in the
hydrogen-exhausted core of all three stars during the giant phase The
result is that all three stars possess a nearly isothermal core along
the giant branch. During and following the shell-narrowing phase in all
three stars, the surface lithium abundance decreases regularly with
decreasing surface temperature as envelope convection extends deeper and
deeper into the star. Such is the case also for the surface ratio of C12
to N14. Comparatively large amounts of He3 are made in all three stars,
and it is suggested that a large fraction of the He3 in the galactic
disk was perhaps formed in ordinary stars. Comparison of individual
tracks with cluster diagrams for NGC 1.88 and M67 provides evidence for
the qualitative correctness of several characteristic features of the
theoretical tracks. The pronounced and rapid change in luminosity and in
surface temperature during the phase of over-all contraction is related
to a ''gap'' in M67; the decrease with decreasing mass in the magnitude of
the luminosity drop during the shell-narrowing phase is related to the
change with cluster age in the slope of the subgiant branch; for a given
luminosity, the decrease with decreasing mass in surface temperature
along the giant branch is related to the decrease with increasing
cluster age in surface temperature along the cluster giant branch. The
ages of NGC 188 and M67 are estimated to be (11 + 2) x 1O yr and (5.5 +
1) X 1O yr, respectively.

both Fermi-Dirac statistics and equipartition of energy per unit mass.
In the relevant limit this becomes Maxwell's distribution but with
temperature proportional to mass. The predicted light distributions are
those of the modified isothermal spheres developed by Michie from
considerations of stellar relaxation in globular clusters. Both these
and the special case fLirther developed by King are known to give
agreement with observations of spherical systems. Application to
clusters of galaxies will remove Zwicky's paradox. The theory is also
developed for rotating systems where allowance must be made for
anisotropy of stellar motions ff the outer parts are not to be much
flatter than the inner parts. The new statistics developed here should
have important applications to collisionless plasmas and coffisionless
shocks. Kelvin's theorem is rederived for collisionless dynamics. It is
suggested that the typical `equilibrium' state of a stellar system may

stability of an arbitrary, highly flattened stellar system, which is
assumed initially to rotate in approximate equilibrium between its
self-gravitation and the centrifugal forces. It is concluded that no
such disk, if fairly smooth or uniform, can be entirely stable against a
tendency to form massive condensations within its own plane, unless the
root-mean-square random velocities of its constituents, in the
directions parallel to that plane, are everywhere sufficiently large.
Lacking such random motions, it is shown that the system must be
vulnerable to numerous unstable disturbances, the dimensions of which
may approach its over-all radius, and whose times of growth are to be
reckoned in fractions of the typical periods of revolution. The minimum
root-mean-square radial velocity dispersion required in any one vicinity
for the complete suppression of all axisymmetric instabilities is
calculated (in collaboration with A. Kalnajs) as 3.36 G /K, where G is
the gravitational constant, and and K are the local values of the
projected stellar density and the epicyclic frequency, respectively.
From that, and the observed j\# and K, together with their uncertainties,
this minimum for the solar neighborhood of our Galaxy is estimated to
fall between 20 and 35 k /sec, a range which indeed encompasses the
actual radial velocity dispersions of the most predominant types of
stars in our vicinity. It is pointed out that both this curious
agreement, and also the well-known discrepancy between the z- and
r-velocity dispersions at least of the older disk stars, may be
explainable in terms of past instabilities of this galactic disk.

the largest excess (i.e., lowest metal abundance) are invariably moving

the dynamics of a collapsing galaxy. The data require that the oldest

collapse was very rapid and only a few times 108 years were required for
the gas to attain circular orbits in equilibrium (i e., gravitational
attraction balanced by centrifugal acceleration). The scale of the

Thus our results warrant against the use of the RGB tip method for determining distances to systems with sparsely populated RGBs, and show how crucial HB observations are in obtaining accurate distances in systems such as these. We find that And X is a relatively faint (MV = -7.36), highly elongated (e = 0.48) system at a distance of 174 +- 62 kpc from Andromeda. And XVII is brighter (MV = -8.61) with an M31-centric distance of 73 kpc which makes it one of the closest satellites to Andromeda. Both galaxies are metal-poor: we derive <[Fe/H]>=-2.2 for And X, while And XVII shows <[Fe/H]> = -2.0, consistent with the relation of higher luminosity dwarfs being more metal- rich. Additionally, both galaxies show considerable intrinsic spreads in metallicity (0.2 and 0.3 dex for And X and And XVII respectively), consistent with multiple stellar populations.},

	Abstract = {The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) started a new phase in August 2008, with new instrumentation and new surveys focused on Galactic structure and chemical evolution, measurements of the baryon oscillation feature in the clustering of galaxies and the quasar Ly alpha forest, and a radial velocity search for planets around ~8000 stars. This paper describes the first data release of SDSS-III (and the eighth counting from the beginning of the SDSS). The release includes 5-band imaging of roughly 5200 deg^2 in the Southern Galactic Cap, bringing the total footprint of the SDSS imaging to 14,555 deg^2, or over a third of the Celestial Sphere. All the imaging data have been reprocessed with an improved sky-subtraction algorithm and a final, self-consistent recalibration and flat-field determination. This release also includes all data from the second phase of the Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Evolution (SEGUE-2), consisting of spectroscopy of approximately 118,000 stars at both high and low Galactic latitudes. All the more than half a million stellar spectra obtained with the SDSS spectrograph have been reprocessed through an improved stellar parameters pipeline, which has better determination of metallicity for high metallicity stars.},

	Abstract = {The degeneracy among the disk, bulge and halo contributions to galaxy rotation curves prevents an understanding of the distribution of baryons and dark matter in disk galaxies. In an attempt to break this degeneracy, we present an analysis of the spiral galaxy strong gravitational lens SDSS J2141-0001, discovered as part of the SLACS survey. We present new Hubble Space Telescope multicolor imaging, gas and stellar kinematics data derived from long-slit spectroscopy, and K-band LGS adaptive optics imaging, both from the Keck telescopes. We model the galaxy as a sum of concentric axisymmetric bulge, disk and halo components and infer the contribution of each component, using information from gravitational lensing and gas kinematics. This analysis yields a best-fitting total (disk plus bulge) stellar mass of log_{10}(Mstar/Msun)=10.99(+0.11,-0.25). The photometric data combined with stellar population synthesis models yield log_{10}(Mstar/Msun)=10.97\pm0.07, and 11.21\pm0.07 for the Chabrier and Salpeter IMFs, respectively. Assuming no cold gas, a Salpeter IMF is marginally disfavored. Accounting for the expected gas fraction of \simeq 20% reduces the lensing plus kinematics stellar mass by 0.10\pm0.05 dex, resulting in a Bayes factor of 11.9 in favor of a Chabrier IMF. The dark matter halo is roughly spherical, with minor to major axis ratio q_{halo}=0.91(+0.15,-0.13). The dark matter halo has a maximum circular velocity of V_{max}=276(+17,-18) km/s, and a central density parameter of log_{10}\Delta_{V/2}=5.9(+0.9,-0.5). This is higher than predicted for uncontracted dark matter haloes in LCDM cosmologies, log_{10}\Delta_{V/2}=5.2, indicating that either the halo has contracted in response to galaxy formation, or that the halo has a higher than average concentration. At 2.2 disk scale lengths the dark matter fraction is f_{DM}=0.55(+0.20,-0.15), making SDSS J2141-0001 sub-maximal.},

	Abstract = {The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) has validated and made publicly available its Second Data Release. This data release consists of 3324 deg2 of five-band (ugriz) imaging data with photometry for over 88 million unique objects, 367,360 spectra of galaxies, quasars, stars, and calibrating blank sky patches selected over 2627 deg2 of this area, and tables of measured parameters from these data. The imaging data reach a depth of r~22.2 (95% completeness limit for point sources) and are photometrically and astrometrically calibrated to 2% rms and 100 mas rms per coordinate, respectively. The imaging data have all been processed through a new version of the SDSS imaging pipeline, in which the most important improvement since the last data release is fixing an error in the model fits to each object. The result is that model magnitudes are now a good proxy for point-spread function magnitudes for point sources, and Petrosian magnitudes for extended sources. The spectroscopy extends from 3800 to 9200 {\AA} at a resolution of 2000. The spectroscopic software now repairs a systematic error in the radial velocities of certain types of stars and has substantially improved spectrophotometry. All data included in the SDSS Early Data Release and First Data Release are reprocessed with the improved pipelines and included in the Second Data Release. Further characteristics of the data are described, as are the data products themselves and the tools for accessing them.},

The catalog contains five-band photometry for 357 million distinct objects. The survey also includes repeat photometry on a 120$\,^{\circ}$ long, 2fdg5 wide stripe along the celestial equator in the Southern Galactic Cap, with some regions covered by as many as 90 individual imaging runs. We include a co-addition of the best of these data, going roughly 2 mag fainter than the main survey over 250 deg2. The survey has completed spectroscopy over 9380 deg2 the spectroscopy is now complete over a large contiguous area of the Northern Galactic Cap, closing the gap that was present in previous data releases. There are over 1.6 million spectra in total, including 930,000 galaxies, 120,000 quasars, and 460,000 stars. The data release includes improved stellar photometry at low Galactic latitude. The astrometry has all been recalibrated with the second version of the USNO CCD Astrograph Catalog, reducing the rms statistical errors at the bright end to 45 milliarcseconds per coordinate. We further quantify a systematic error in bright galaxy photometry due to poor sky determination; this problem is less severe than previously reported for the majority of galaxies. Finally, we describe a series of improvements to the spectroscopic reductions, including better flat fielding and improved wavelength calibration at the blue end, better processing of objects with extremely strong narrow emission lines, and an improved determination of stellar metallicities.},

	Abstract = {An unsupervised software ``robot'' that automatically and robustly reduces and analyzes CCD observations of photometric standard stars is described. The robot measures extinction coefficients and other photometric parameters in real time and, more carefully, on the next day. It also reduces and analyzes data from an all-sky 10 mum camera to detect clouds; photometric data taken during cloudy periods are automatically rejected. The robot reports its findings to observers and data analysts via the World Wide Web. It can be used to assess photometricity and to build data on site conditions. The robot's automated and uniform site monitoring represents a minimum standard for any observing site with queue scheduling, a public data archive, or likely participation in any future National Virtual Observatory.

	Abstract = {We describe a standard star catalog constructed using multiple SDSS photometric observations (at least four per band, with a median of 10) in the ugriz system. The catalog includes 1.01 million nonvariable unresolved objects from the equatorial stripe 82 (|deltaJ2000.0| < 1.266$\,^{\circ}$) in the right ascension range 20h34m-4h00m and with the corresponding r-band (approximately Johnson V-band) magnitudes in the range 14-22. The distributions of measurements for individual sources demonstrate that the photometric pipeline correctly estimates random photometric errors, which are below 0.01 mag for stars brighter than 19.5, 20.5, 20.5, 20, and 18.5 in ugriz, respectively (about twice as good as for individual SDSS runs). Several independent tests of the internal consistency suggest that the spatial variation of photometric zero points is not larger than ~0.01 mag (rms). In addition to being the largest available data set with optical photometry internally consistent at the ~1% level, this catalog provides a practical definition of the SDSS photometric system. Using this catalog, we show that photometric zero points for SDSS observing runs can be calibrated within a nominal uncertainty of 2% even for data obtained through 1 mag thick clouds, and we demonstrate the existence of He and H white dwarf sequences using photometric data alone. Based on the properties of this catalog, we conclude that upcoming large-scale optical surveys such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope will be capable of delivering robust 1% photometry for billions of sources.},

	Abstract = {We quantify the variability of faint unresolved optical sources using a catalog based on multiple SDSS imaging observations. The catalog covers SDSS stripe 82, which lies along the celestial equator in the southern Galactic hemisphere (22h24m < alphaJ2000.0 < 04h08m, -1.27$\,^{\circ}$ < deltaJ2000.0 < +1.27$\,^{\circ}$, ~290 deg2), and contains 34 million photometric observations in the SDSS ugriz system for 748,084 unresolved sources at high Galactic latitudes (b < -20$\,^{\circ}$) that were observed at least four times in each of the ugri bands (with a median of 10 observations obtained over ~6 yr). In each photometric bandpass we compute various low-order light-curve statistics, such as rms scatter, chi2 per degree of freedom, skewness, and minimum and maximum magnitude, and use them to select and study variable sources. We find that 2% of unresolved optical sources brighter than g = 20.5 appear variable at the 0.05 mag level (rms) simultaneously in the g and r bands (at high Galactic latitudes). The majority (2 out of 3) of these variable sources are low-redshift (<2) quasars, although they represent only 2% of all sources in the adopted flux-limited sample. We find that at least 90% of quasars are variable at the 0.03 mag level (rms) and confirm that variability is as good a method for finding low-redshift quasars as the UV excess color selection (at high Galactic latitudes). We analyze the distribution of light-curve skewness for quasars and find that it is centered on zero. We find that about one-fourth of the variable stars are RR Lyrae stars, and that only 0.5% of stars from the main stellar locus are variable at the 0.05 mag level. The distribution of light-curve skewness in the g - r versus u - g color-color diagram on the main stellar locus is found to be bimodal (with one mode consistent with Algol-like behavior). Using over 600 RR Lyrae stars, we demonstrate rich halo substructure out to distances of 100 kpc. We extrapolate these results to the expected performance by the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and estimate that it will obtain well-sampled, 2% accurate, multicolor light curves for ~2 million low-redshift quasars and discover at least 50 million variable stars.},

	Abstract = {The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) mosaic camera and telescope have obtained five-band optical-wavelength imaging near the Galactic plane outside of the nominal survey boundaries. These additional data were obtained during commissioning and subsequent testing of the SDSS observing system, and they provide unique wide-area imaging data in regions of high obscuration and star formation, including numerous young stellar objects, Herbig-Haro objects, and young star clusters. Because these data are outside the survey regions in the Galactic caps, they are not part of the standard SDSS data releases. This paper presents imaging data for 832 square degrees of sky (including repeats), in the star-forming regions of Orion, Taurus, and Cygnus. About 470 deg2 are now released to the public, with the remainder to follow at the time of SDSS Data Release 4. The public data in Orion include the star-forming region NGC 2068/NGC 2071/HH 24 and a large part of Barnard's loop.},

	Abstract = {In stellar dynamical computer simulations, as well as other types of simulations using particles, time step size is often held constant in order to guarantee a high degree of energy conservation. In many applications, allowing the time step size to change in time can offer a great saving in computational cost, but variable-size time steps usually imply a substantial degradation in energy conservation. We present a meta-algorithm' for choosing time steps in such a way as to guarantee time symmetry in any integration scheme, thus allowing vastly improved energy conservation for orbital calculations with variable time steps. We apply the algorithm to the familiar leapfrog scheme, and generalize to higher order integration schemes, showing how the stability properties of the fixed-step leapfrog scheme can be extended to higher order, variable-step integrators such as the Hermite method. We illustrate the remarkable properties of these time-symmetric integrators for the case of a highly eccentric elliptical Kepler orbit and discuss applications to more complex problems.},

	Abstract = {A novel method is described of directly calculating the force on N in the gravitational N-body problem that grows only as N log N. The technique uses a tree-structured hierarchical subdivision of space into cubic cells, each of which is recursively divided into eight subcells whenever more than one particle is found to occupy the same cell. This tree is constructed anew at every time step, avoiding ambiguity and tangling. Advantages over potential-solving codes include accurate local interactions, freedom from geometrical assumptions and restrictions, and applicability to a wide class of systems, including planetary, stellar, galactic, and cosmological ones. Advantages over previous hierarchical tree-codes include simplicity and the possibility of rigorous analysis of error.},

	Abstract = {We describe a new code for numerical solution of three-dimensional self-gravitational hydrodynamics problems. This code utilizes the technique of local adaptive mesh refinement (AMR), employing multiple grids at multiple levels of resolution and automatically and dynamically adding and removing these grids as necessary to maintain adequate resolution. This technology allows solution of problems that would be prohibitively expensive with a code using fixed resolution, and it is more versatile and efficient than competing methods of achieving variable resolution. In particular, we apply this technique to simulate the collapse and fragmentation of a molecular cloud, a key step in star formation. The simulation involves many orders of magnitude of variation in length scale as fragments form at positions that are not a priori discernible from general initial conditions. In this paper, we describe the methodology behind this new code and present several illustrative applications. The criterion that guides the degree of adaptive mesh refinement is critical to the success of the scheme, and, for the isothermal problems considered here, we employ the Jeans condition for this purpose. By maintaining resolution finer than the local Jeans length, we set new benchmarks of accuracy by which to measure other codes on each problem we consider, including the uniform collapse of a finite pressured cloud. We find that the uniformly rotating, spherical clouds treated here first collapse to disks in the equatorial plane and then, in the presence of applied perturbations, form filamentary singularities that do not fragment while isothermal. Our results provide numerical confirmation of recent work by Inutsuka & Miyama on this scenario of isothermal filament formation.},

@article{Henrion:2010,
	Abstract = {Star-galaxy classification is one of the most fundamental data-processing tasks in survey astronomy, and a critical starting point for the scientific exploitation of survey data. For bright sources this classification can be done with almost complete reliability, but for the numerous sources close to a survey's detection limit each image encodes only limited morphological information. In this regime, from which many of the new scientific discoveries are likely to come, it is vital to utilise all the available information about a source, both from multiple measurements and also prior knowledge about the star and galaxy populations. It is also more useful and realistic to provide classification probabilities than decisive classifications. All these desiderata can be met by adopting a Bayesian approach to star-galaxy classification, and we develop a very general formalism for doing so. An immediate implication of applying Bayes's theorem to this problem is that it is formally impossible to combine morphological measurements in different bands without using colour information as well; however we develop several approximations that disregard colour information as much as possible. The resultant scheme is applied to data from the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS), and tested by comparing the results to deep Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Stripe 82 measurements of the same sources. The Bayesian classification probabilities obtained from the UKIDSS data agree well with the deep SDSS classifications both overall (a mismatch rate of 0.022, compared to 0.044 for the UKIDSS pipeline classifier) and close to the UKIDSS detection limit (a mismatch rate of 0.068 compared to 0.075 for the UKIDSS pipeline classifier). The Bayesian formalism developed here can be applied to improve the reliability of any star-galaxy classification schemes based on the measured values of morphology statistics alone.},

Stripe 82 has been repeatedly monitored in the u, g, r, i and z bands over a seven-year baseline. Objects are cross-matched between runs, taking into account the effects of any proper motion. The resulting catalogue contains almost 4 million light-motion curves of stellar objects and galaxies. The photometry are recalibrated to correct for varying photometric zero-points, achieving ~20 and 30 mmag rms accuracy down to 18 mag in the g,r,i and z bands for point sources and extended sources, respectively. The astrometry are recalibrated to correct for inherent systematic errors in the SDSS astrometric solutions, achieving ~32 and 35 mas rms accuracy down to 18 mag for point sources and extended sources, respectively.  For each light-motion curve, 229 photometric and astrometric quantities are derived and stored in a higher level catalogue. On the photometric side, these include mean exponential and point spread function (PSF) magnitudes along with uncertainties, rms scatter, chi2 per degree of freedom, various magnitude distribution percentiles, object type (stellar or galaxy), and eclipse, Stetson and Vidrih variability indices. On the astrometric side, these quantities include mean positions, proper motions as well as their uncertainties and chi2 per degree of freedom. The light-motion curve catalogue presented here is complete down to r ~ 21.5 and is at present the deepest large-area photometric and astrometric variability catalogue available.},

	Abstract = {We present an analysis of the substructure revealed by RRLyraes in Sloan Digital Sky Survey Stripe 82, which covers in declination on the celestial equator over the right ascension range to . We use the new public archive of light-motion curves in Stripe 82, published by Bramich et al. in 2008, to identify a set of high-quality RRLyrae candidates. Period estimates are determined to high accuracy using a string-length method. A subset of 178 RRLyraes with spectrally derived metallicities are employed to derive metallicity-period-amplitude relations, which are then used, together with archive magnitude data and light-curve Fourier decomposition, to estimate metallicities and hence distances for the entire sample. The RRLyraes lie 5-115kpc from the Galactic Centre, with distance estimates accurate to ~8 per cent. The RRLyraes are further divided into subsets of 316 RRab types and 91 RRc types based on their period, colour and metallicity.  We fit a smooth density law to the distribution as a simple representation of the data. For Galactocentric radii 5-25kpc the number density of RRLyraes falls as r-2.4, but beyond 25kpc, the number density falls much more steeply, as r-4.5. However, we stress that in practice the density distribution is not smooth, but dominated by clumps and substructure. Samples of 55 and 237 RRLyraes associated with the Sagittarius Stream and the Hercules-Aquila Cloud, respectively, are identified. Hence, ~70 per cent of the RRLyraes in Stripe 82 belong to known substructure, and the sharp break in the density law reflects the fact that the dominant substructure in Stripe 82 - the Hercules-Aquila Cloud and the Sagittarius Stream - lie within 40kpc. In fact, almost 60 per cent of all the RRLyraes in Stripe 82 are associated with the Hercules-Aquila Cloud alone, which emphasizes the cloud's pre-eminence. Additionally, evidence of a new and distant substructure - the Pisces Overdensity - is found, consisting of 28 faint RRLyraes centred on Galactic coordinates (l ~ 80$\,^{\circ}$, b ~ -55$\,^{\circ}$), with distances of ~80kpc. The total stellar mass in the Pisces Overdensity is ~104Msolar and its metallicity is [Fe/H] ~ -1.5.},

The rationale for the generalized mapping method is discussed as well as details for the mapping for the n-body problem. Some refinements of the method are considered, and the relationship of the mapping method to other symplectic integration methods is shown. The method is used to compute the evolution of the outer planets for a billion years. The resulting evolution is compared to the 845 million year evolution of the outer planets performed on the Digital Orerry using standard numerical integration techniques. This calculation provides independent numerical confirmation of the result of Sussman and Wisdom (1988) that the motion of the planet Pluto is chaotic.},

The methods' advantages and disadvantages (with respect to more common integration methods) are discussed. The numerical performance of the algorithms is evaluated using the two-body and circular restricted three-body problems. Symplectic integration methods have the advantages of linear phase error growth in the two-body problem (unlike most other methods), good conservation of the integrals of the motion, good performance for moderately eccentric orbits, and ease of use. Its disadvantages include a relatively large number of force evaluations and an inability to continuously vary the step size.},

@article{Sesar:2010,
	Abstract = {We present an improved analysis of halo substructure traced by RR Lyrae stars in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) stripe 82 region. With the addition of SDSS-II data, a revised selection method based on new ugriz light curve templates results in a sample of 483 RR Lyrae stars that is essentially free of contamination. The main result from our first study persists: the spatial distribution of halo stars at galactocentric distances 5-100 kpc is highly inhomogeneous. At least 20% of halo stars within 30 kpc from the Galactic center can be statistically associated with substructure. We present strong direct evidence, based on both RR Lyrae stars and main-sequence stars, that the halo stellar number density profile significantly steepens beyond a Galactocentric distance of ~30 kpc, and a larger fraction of the stars are associated with substructure. By using a novel method that simultaneously combines data for RR Lyrae and main-sequence stars, and using photometric metallicity estimates for main-sequence stars derived from deep co-added u-band data, we measure the metallicity of the Sagittarius dSph tidal stream (trailing arm) toward R.A. ~2h-3h and decl. ~ 0$\,^{\circ}$ to be 0.3 dex higher ([Fe/H] = -1.2) than that of surrounding halo field stars. Together with a similar result for another major halo substructure, the Monoceros stream, these results support theoretical predictions that an early forming, smooth inner halo, is metal-poor compared to high surface brightness material that have been accreted onto a later-forming outer halo. The mean metallicity of stars in the outer halo that are not associated with detectable clumps may still be more metal-poor than the bulk of inner-halo stars, as has been argued from other data sets.},

	Abstract = {The conjecture that the ancient globular clusters (GCs) formed at the center of their own dark matter halos was first proposed by Peebles (1984), and has recently been revived to explain the puzzling abundance patterns observed within many GCs. In this Letter we demonstrate that the outer stellar density profile of isolated GCs is very sensitive to the presence of an extended dark halo. The GCs NGC 2419, located at 90 kpc from the center of our Galaxy, and MGC1, located at ~200 kpc from the center of M31, are ideal laboratories for testing the scenario that GCs formed at the centers of massive dark halos. Comparing analytic models to observations of these GCs, we conclude that these GCs cannot be embedded within dark halos with a virial mass greater than 10^6 Msun, or, equivalently, the dark matter halo mass-to-stellar mass ratio must be Mdm/M_*<1. If these GCs have indeed orbited within weak tidal fields throughout their lifetimes, then these limits imply that these GCs did not form within their own dark halos. Recent observations of an extended stellar halo in the GC NGC 1851 are also interpreted in the context of our analytic models. Implications of these results for the formation of GCs are briefly discussed.},

	Abstract = {We present the first detection of a 6.7 GHz Class II methanol (CH3OH) maser in the Andromeda galaxy (M31). The CH3OH maser was found in a Very Large Array (VLA) survey during the fall of 2009. We have confirmed the methanol maser with the new Expanded VLA (EVLA), in operation since March 2010, but were unsuccessful in detecting a water maser at this location. A direct application for this methanol maser is the determination of the proper motion of M31, such as was obtained with water masers in M33 and IC10 previously. Unraveling the three-dimensional velocity of M31 would solve for the biggest unknown in the modeling of the dynamics and evolution of the Local Group of galaxies.},

	Abstract = {Repeat scans by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) of a 278-deg2 stripe along the celestial equator have yielded an average of over 10 observations each for nearly 8000 spectroscopically confirmed quasars. Over 2500 of these quasars are in the redshift range such that the CIV lambda 1549 emission line is visible in the SDSS spectrum. Utilizing the width of these CIV lines and the luminosity of the nearby continuum, we estimate black hole masses for these objects. In an effort to isolate the effects of black hole mass and luminosity on the photometric variability of our data set, we create several subsamples by binning in these two physical parameters. By comparing the ensemble structure functions of the quasars in these bins, we are able to reproduce the well-known anticorrelation between luminosity and variability, now showing that this anticorrelation is independent of the black hole mass. In addition, we find a correlation between variability and the mass of the central black hole. By combining these two relations, we identify the Eddington ratio as a possible driver of quasar variability, most likely due to differences in accretion efficiency.},

	Abstract = {We study the evolution of the scaling relations between maximum circular velocity, stellar mass and optical half-light radius of star-forming disk-dominated galaxies in the context of LCDM-based galaxy formation models. Using data from the literature combined with new data from the DEEP2 and AEGIS surveys we show that there is a consistent observational and theoretical picture for the evolution of these scaling relations from z\sim 2 to z=0. The evolution of the observed stellar scaling relations is weaker than that of the virial scaling relations of dark matter haloes, which can be reproduced, both qualitatively and quantitatively, with a simple, cosmologically-motivated model for disk evolution inside growing NFW dark matter haloes. In this model optical half-light radii are smaller, both at fixed stellar mass and maximum circular velocity, at higher redshifts. This model also predicts that the scaling relations between baryonic quantities evolve even more weakly than the corresponding stellar relations. We emphasize, though, that this weak evolution does not imply that individual galaxies evolve weakly. On the contrary, individual galaxies grow strongly in mass, size and velocity, but in such a way that they move largely along the scaling relations. Finally, recent observations have claimed surprisingly large sizes for a number of star-forming disk galaxies at z \sim 2, which has caused some authors to suggest that high redshift disk galaxies have abnormally high spin parameters. However, we argue that the disk scale lengths in question have been systematically overestimated by a factor \sim 2, and that there is an offset of a factor \sim 1.4 between H\alpha sizes and optical sizes. Taking these effects into account, there is no indication that star forming galaxies at high redshifts (z\sim 2) have abnormally high spin parameters.},

@article{Bailer-Jones:2010,
	Abstract = {Astrometric surveys provide the opportunity to measure the absolute magnitudes of large numbers of stars, but only if the individual line-of-sight extinctions are known. Unfortunately, extinction is highly degenerate with stellar effective temperature when estimated from broad band optical/infrared photometry. To address this problem, I introduce a Bayesian method for estimating the intrinsic parameters of a star and its line-of-sight extinction. It uses both photometry and parallaxes in a self-consistent manner in order to provide a non-parametric posterior probability distribution over the parameters. The method makes explicit use of domain knowledge by employing the Hertzsprung--Russell Diagram (HRD) to constrain solutions and to ensure that they respect stellar physics. I first demonstrate this method by using it to estimate effective temperature and extinction from BVJHK data for a set of artificially reddened Hipparcos stars, for which accurate effective temperatures have been estimated from high resolution spectroscopy. Using just the four colours, we see the expected strong degeneracy (positive correlation) between the temperature and extinction. Introducing the parallax, apparent magnitude and the HRD reduces this degeneracy and improves both the precision (reduces the error bars) and the accuracy of the parameter estimates, the latter by about 35%. The resulting accuracy is about 200K in temperature and 0.2mag in extinction. I then apply the method to estimate these parameters and absolute magnitudes for some 47000 F,G,K Hipparcos stars which have been cross-matched with 2MASS. The method can easily be extended to incorporate the estimation of other parameters, in particular metallicity and surface gravity, making it particularly suitable for the analysis of the 10^9 stars from Gaia.},

	Abstract = {We dissect giant Sc-Scd galaxies with Hubble Space Telescope photometry and Hobby-Eberly Telescope spectroscopy. We use HET's High Resolution Spectrograph (resolution = 15,000) to measure stellar velocity dispersions in the nuclear star clusters and pseudobulges of the pure-disk galaxies M33, M101, NGC 3338, NGC 3810, NGC 6503, and NGC 6946. We conclude: (1) Upper limits on the masses of any supermassive black holes are MBH <= (2.6+-0.5) * 10**6 M_Sun in M101 and MBH <= (2.0+-0.6) * 10**6 M_Sun in NGC 6503. (2) HST photometry shows that the above galaxies contain tiny pseudobulges that make up <~ 3 % of the stellar mass but no classical bulges. We inventory a sphere of radius 8 Mpc centered on our Galaxy to see whether giant, pure-disk galaxies are common or rare. In this volume, 11 of 19 galaxies with rotation velocity > 150 km/s show no evidence for a classical bulge. Four may contain small classical bulges that contribute 5-12% of the galaxy light. Only 4 of the 19 giant galaxies are ellipticals or have classical bulges that contribute 1/3 of the galaxy light. So pure-disk galaxies are far from rare. It is hard to understand how they could form as the quiescent tail of a distribution of merger histories. Recognition of pseudobulges makes the biggest problem with cold dark matter galaxy formation more acute: How can hierarchical clustering make so many giant, pure-disk galaxies with no evidence for merger-built bulges? This problem depends strongly on environment: the Virgo cluster is not a puzzle, because >2/3 of its stellar mass is in merger remnants.},

	Abstract = {Fully cosmological, high-resolution N-body+smooth particle hydrodynamic simulations are used to investigate the chemical abundance trends of stars in simulated stellar halos as a function of their origin. These simulations employ a physically motivated supernova feedback recipe, as well as metal enrichment, metal cooling, and metal diffusion. As presented in an earlier paper, the simulated galaxies in this study are surrounded by stellar halos whose inner regions contain both stars accreted from satellite galaxies and stars formed in situ in the central regions of the main galaxies and later displaced by mergers into their inner halos. The abundance patterns ([Fe/H] and [O/Fe]) of halo stars located within 10 kpc of a solar-like observer are analyzed. We find that for galaxies which have not experienced a recent major merger, in situ stars at the high [Fe/H] end of the metallicity distribution function are more [alpha/Fe]-rich than accreted stars at similar [Fe/H]. This dichotomy in the [O/Fe] of halo stars at a given [Fe/H] results from the different potential wells within which in situ and accreted halo stars form. These results qualitatively match recent observations of local Milky Way halo stars. It may thus be possible for observers to uncover the relative contribution of different physical processes to the formation of stellar halos by observing such trends in the halo populations of the Milky Way and other local Lsstarf galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the variety in quasar UV spectra (lambdalambda1020-1600), with emphasis on the weak emission lines in the Lyalpha forest region, using principal component analysis (PCA). We use 50 smooth continuum-fitted quasar spectra (0.14<z<1.04) taken by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Faint Object Spectrograph. The first, second, and third principal component spectra (PCS) account for 63.4%, 14.5%, and 6.2% of the variance, respectively, and the first seven PCS account for 96.1% of the total variance. Three weak emission lines in the Lyalpha forest are identified as Fe II lambda1070.95, Fe II + Fe III lambda1123.17, and C III* lambda1175.88. Using the first two standardized PCS coefficients, we introduce five classifications. By actively using PCS, we can generate artificial quasar spectra that are useful in testing the detection of quasars, DLAs, and the continuum calibration. We show that the power-law-extrapolated continuum is inadequate to perform precise measurements of the mean flux in the Lyalpha forest because of the weak emission lines and the extended tails of Lyalpha and Lybeta/O VI emission lines. We show that we miss 5.3% of the flux on average, and there are cases where we would miss 14% of the flux. These corrections are essential in the study of the intergalactic medium at high redshift in order to achieve precise measurements of physical properties, cosmological parameters, and the reionization epoch.},

	Abstract = {High resolution spectroscopy of high redshift quasar spectra enables us to investigate the properties of the intergalactic medium (IGM) and measure cosmological parameters from the Lya forest. Toward high precision cosmology, this dissertation presents the following four topics. (1) Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on quasar spectrum: We introduce the PCA to describe quasar emission lines and continua quantitatively, and we attempt to make a prediction of the continuum shape in the Lya forest using wavelengths redward of Lya emission. (2) Flux calibration of Keck HIRES data: On our way to achieve high accuracy measurement, it was necessary to develop new calibration schemes and explore the origin of systematic errors. My contribution includes the following and is discussed throughout the thesis: (i) the development of the flux calibration scheme, (ii) the discovery of three emission lines in the Lya forest, (iii) the establishment of high resolution standard star spectra, and (iv) the identification of ozone lines in the spectrum. (3) D/H measurement: We present precise measurements of the primordial deuterium to hydrogen ratio (D/ H) toward two quasars, HS0105+1619 and Q1243+3047, which constrains the baryon to photon ratio e = 5.9 +/- 0.5 x 10 -10 or the baryon density O b h 2 = 0.0214 +/- 0.0020 via the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis theory. (4) Studies of the Lya forest at z ~ 2: We also present the measurements of the total amount of neutral hydrogen absorption in the IGM. We compare our observed data with hydrodynamic simulations and find good agreement when we use the following cosmological parameters: H o = 71 kin s -1 Mpc -1 , O L = 0.73, O m = 0.27, O b = 0.044, the amplitude of the power spectrum s 8 = 0.9, and the photoinization rate G 912 = (1.44 +/- 0.11) x 10 -12 s -1 . We conclude that the measurements of the cosmological parameters from our primordial D/H measurements, recent WMAP satellite observation of the cosmic microwave background, and our the total amount of neutral hydrogen in the IGM at z ~ 2 are in a concordance with the LCDM model.},

	Abstract = {We present a method to make predictions with sets of correlated data values, in this case QSO flux spectra. We predict the continuum in the Lyalpha forest of a QSO, from 1020 to 1216 {\AA}, using the spectrum of that QSO from 1216 to 1600 {\AA}. We find correlations between the unabsorbed flux in these two wavelength regions in the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) spectra of 50 QSOs. We use principal component analysis to summarize the variety of these spectra, relate the weights of the principal components for 1020-1600 {\AA} to the weights for 1216-1600 {\AA}, and apply this relation to make predictions. We test the method on the HST spectra and find an average absolute flux error of 9%, with a range of 3%-30%, where individual predictions are systematically too low or too high. We mention several ways in which the predictions might be improved.},

@article{Hogg:2010,
	Abstract = {We go through the many considerations involved in fitting a model to data, using as an example the fit of a straight line to a set of points in a two-dimensional plane. Standard weighted least-squares fitting is only appropriate when there is a dimension along which the data points have negligible uncertainties, and another along which all the uncertainties can be described by Gaussians of known variance; these conditions are rarely met in practice. We consider cases of general, heterogeneous, and arbitrarily covariant two-dimensional uncertainties, and situations in which there are bad data (large outliers), unknown uncertainties, and unknown but expected intrinsic scatter in the linear relationship being fit. Above all we emphasize the importance of having a "generative model" for the data, even an approximate one. Once there is a generative model, the subsequent fitting is non-arbitrary because the model permits direct computation of the likelihood of the parameters or the posterior probability distribution. Construction of a posterior probability distribution is indispensible if there are "nuisance parameters" to marginalize away.},

@article{Dutton:2005,
	Abstract = {This paper addresses available constraints on mass models fitted to rotation curves. Mass models of disk galaxies have well-known degeneracies that prevent a unique mass decomposition. The most notable is due to the unknown value of the stellar mass-to-light ratio (the disk-halo degeneracy); even with this known, degeneracies between the halo parameters themselves may prevent an unambiguous determination of the shape of the dark halo profile, which includes the inner density slope of the dark matter halo. The latter is often referred to as the ``cusp-core degeneracy.'' We explore constraints on the disk and halo parameters and apply these to four mock and six observed disk galaxies with high resolution and extended rotation curves. Our full set of constraints consists of mass-to-light (M/L) ratios from stellar population synthesis models based on B-R colors, constraints on halo parameters from N-body simulations, and constraining the halo virial velocity to be less than the maximum observed velocity. These constraints are only partially successful in lifting the cusp-core degeneracy. The effect of adiabatic contraction of the halo by the disk is to steepen cores into cusps and reduce the best-fit halo concentration and M/L values (often significantly). We also discuss the effect of disk thickness, halo flattening, distance errors, and rotation curve error values on mass modeling. Increasing the imposed minimum rotation curve error from typically low, underestimated values to more realistic estimates decreases the chi2 substantially and makes distinguishing between a cuspy or cored halo profile even more difficult. In spite of the degeneracies and uncertainties present, our constrained mass modeling favors submaximal disks (i.e., a dominant halo) at 2.2 disk scale lengths, with Vdisk/Vtot<~0.6. This result holds for both the unbarred and weakly barred galaxies in our sample.},

@article{Deason:2010,
	Abstract = {We search for signs of rotation in the subsystems of the Milky Way and M31 that are defined by their satellite galaxies, their globular cluster populations, and their BHB stars. A set of simple distribution functions are introduced to describe anisotropic and rotating stellar populations embedded in dark haloes of approximate Navarro-Frenk-White form. The BHB stars in the Milky Way halo exhibit a dichotomy between a prograde rotating, comparatively metal-rich component ([Fe/H] > -2) and a retrograde rotating, comparatively metal-poor ([Fe/H] < -2) component. The prograde metal-rich population may be associated with the accretion of a massive satellite (~ 10^9 solar masses). The metal-poor population may characterise the primordial stellar halo and the net retrograde rotation could then reflect an underestimate in our adopted local standard of rest circular velocity Theta_0. If Theta_0 is ~ 240 km/s then the metal-poor component has no rotation and there is a net prograde rotation signal of ~45 km/s in the metal-rich component. There is reasonable evidence that the Milky Way globular cluster and satellite galaxy systems are rotating with <v_phi> ~50 km/s and <v_phi> ~ 40 km/s respectively. Furthermore, a stronger signal is found for the satellite galaxies when the angular momentum vector of the satellites is inclined with respect to the normal of the disc. The dwarf spheroidal satellites of M31 exhibit prograde rotation relative to the M31 disc with <v_phi> ~ 40 km/s. We postulate that this group of dwarf spheroidals may share a common origin. We also find strong evidence for systemic rotation in the globular clusters of M31 particularly for the most metal-rich.},

	Abstract = {The behavior of density waves in a simple analog of a rotating disk is analyzed. The model considered is a thin gas sheet whose unperturbed velocity field is a parallel shear flow; the effects of rotation are simulated by introducing a Coriolis acceleration; the model exhibits Lindblad resonances and includes both long- and short-wavelength density waves among its linear perturbations. The linear perturbation equations are set up in a form appropriate to the model and rewritten in terms of the comoving coordinates of the unperturbed flow. The resulting equations are Fourier transformed and then solved in the tight-winding limit. The excitation of a wave packet by an external potential is calculated along with the packet's subsequent propagation, and analytical solutions are obtained which are valid everywhere, including the Lindblad and corotation resonances. It is found that a barlike potential excites long-wavelength trailing density waves at the Lindblad resonances. The amplification of a density wave incident on the forbidden zone surrounding corotation is also examined.},

	Abstract = {The linear response of a differentially rotating two-dimensional gas disk, both with and without self-gravity, to a rigidly rotating external potential is calculated on the assumptions that the speed of sound is much smaller that the orbital velocity and that the external potential varies on the scale of the disk radius. The results show that: (1) the external potential exerts torques on the disk only at the Lindblad and corotation resonances; (2) the torque is positive at the outer Lindblad resonance and negative at the inner Lindblad resonance; (3) the torque at corotation has the sign of the radial vorticity gradient; and (4) the torques are of the same order of magnitude at both types of resonance and independent of the speed of sound in the disk. It is found that the external potential also excites density waves in the vicinity of the Lindblad and corotation resonances, that the long trailing wave is excited at a Lindblad resonance, and that short trailing waves are excited at the corotation resonance. The behavior of particle disks is briefly discussed, and the external torques on particle disks are proven to be identical to those on gas disks},

	Abstract = {Two-component mass models, consisting of an exponential disk and a spherical halo, are constructed to fit a newly determined rotation curve of NGC 3198 that extends to 11 disk scale lengths. The amount of dark matter inside the last point of the rotation curve, at 30 kpc, is at least 4 times larger than the amount of visible matter, with M/L(B)tot = 18 solar M/L(B). The maximum mass-to-light ratio for the disk is M/L(B) = 3.6. The available data cannot discriminate between disk models with low M/L and high M/L, but arguments are presented which suggest that the true mass-to-light ratio of the disk is close to the maximum computed value. The core radius of the distribution of dark matter is found to satisfy R(core) of between 1.7 and 12.5 kpc.},

@article{Bell:2003,
	Abstract = {We use a large sample of galaxies from the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to calculate galaxy luminosity and stellar mass functions in the local universe. We estimate corrections for passband shifting and galaxy evolution, as well as present-day stellar mass-to-light (M/L) ratios, by fitting the optical-near-infrared galaxy data with simple models. Accounting for the 8% galaxy overdensity in the SDSS early data release region, the optical and near-infrared luminosity functions we construct for this sample agree with most recent literature optical and near-infrared determinations within the uncertainties. We argue that 2MASS is biased against low surface brightness galaxies and use SDSS plus our knowledge of stellar populations to estimate the ``true'' K-band luminosity function. This has a steeper faint end slope and a slightly higher overall luminosity density than the direct estimate. Furthermore, assuming a universally applicable stellar initial mass function (IMF), we find good agreement between the stellar mass function we derive from the 2MASS/SDSS data and that derived by Cole et al. The faint end slope for the stellar mass function is steeper than -1.1, reflecting the low stellar M/L ratios characteristic of low-mass galaxies. We estimate an upper limit to the stellar mass density in the local universe Omega*h=2.0+/-0.6×10-3 by assuming an IMF as rich in low-mass stars as allowed by observations of galaxy dynamics in the local universe. The stellar mass density may be lower than this value if a different IMF with fewer low-mass stars is assumed. Finally, we examine type-dependence in the optical and near-infrared luminosity functions and the stellar mass function. In agreement with previous work, we find that the characteristic luminosity or mass of early-type galaxies is larger than for later types, and the faint end slope is steeper for later types than for earlier types. Accounting for typing uncertainties, we estimate that at least half, and perhaps as much as 3/4, of the stellar mass in the universe is in early-type galaxies. As an aid to workers in the field, we present in an Appendix the relationship between model stellar M/L ratios and colors in SDSS/2MASS passbands, an updated discussion of near-infrared stellar M/L ratio estimates, and the volume-corrected distribution of g- and K-band stellar M/L ratios as a function of stellar mass.},

	Abstract = {Aims: We test cosmological models of structure formation using the rotation curve of the nearest spiral galaxy, M 31, determined using a recent deep, full-disk 21-cm imaging survey smoothed to 466 pc resolution.  Methods: We fit a tilted ring model to the HI data from 8 to 37 kpc and establish conclusively the presence of a dark halo and its density distribution via dynamical analysis of the rotation curve.  Results: The disk of M 31 warps from 25 kpc outwards and becomes more inclined with respect to our line of sight. Newtonian dynamics without a dark matter halo provide a very poor fit to the rotation curve. In the framework of modified Newtonian dynamic (MOND) however the 21-cm rotation curve is well fitted by the gravitational potential traced by the baryonic matter density alone. The inclusion of a dark matter halo with a density profile as predicted by hierarchical clustering and structure formation in a LambdaCDM cosmology makes the mass model in newtonian dynamic compatible with the rotation curve data. The dark halo concentration parameter for the best fit is C = 12 and its total mass is 1.2 × 1012 M_o. If a dark halo model with a constant-density core is considered, the core radius has to be larger than 20 kpc in order for the model to provide a good fit to the data. We extrapolate the best-fit LambdaCDM and constant-density core mass models to very large galactocentric radii, comparable to the size of the dark matter halo. A comparison of the predicted mass with the M 31 mass determined at such large radii using other dynamical tracers, confirms the validity of our results. In particular the LambdaCDM dark halo model which best fits the 21-cm data well reproduces the mass of M 31 traced out to 560 kpc. Our best estimate for the total mass of M 31 is 1.3 × 1012 M_o, with 12% baryonic fraction and only 6% of the baryons in the neutral gas phase.},

	Abstract = {A new, 2.8 deg2 J, H, Ks near-infrared (NIR) survey from the 2MASS 6X program across the extent of the optical disk of the Andromeda (M31) galaxy provides a clear view of the M31 center almost completely unfettered by dust extinction and reveals a high-contrast bulge with very boxy isophotes dominating the NIR light to a semimajor axis of ~700" (2.6 kpc). The inner bulge (<~50") isophotes are relatively circular but show some twisting. Beyond this, (1) the M31 bulge ellipticity increases, (2) its position angle is constant at ~50$\,^{\circ}$, or about 10$\,^{\circ}$ higher than the position angle of the M31 disk, and (3) its boxiness increases to a degree (~3%-4%) comparable to other renowned examples of boxy bulges observed in the NIR. In a companion paper, self-consistent N-body simulations of a classical bulge plus a bar with a boxy bulge are shown to reproduce the observed NIR M31 features presented here. Beyond the boxy bulge region and nearly along the 40$\,^{\circ}$ position angle of the disk a narrow ridge of NIR flux, which can be identified with the thin part of the bar, more or less symmetrically extends into the inner disk at semimajor axis radii of 700"-1200" or more. Little variation in the morphology or relative brightnesses of these various M31 structures is seen across the NIR bands (e.g., no color gradients are seen). These new data verify that M31 is a barred spiral galaxy like the Milky Way.},

	Abstract = {We show that bars in galaxy models having halos of moderate density and a variety of velocity distributions all experience a strong drag from dynamical friction unless the halo has large angular momentum in the same sense as the disk. The frictional drag decreases the bar pattern speed, driving the corotation point out to distances well in excess of those estimated in barred galaxies. The halo angular momentum required to avoid strong braking is unrealistically large, even when rotation is confined to the inner halo only. We conclude, therefore, that bars are able to maintain their observed high pattern speeds only if the halo has a central density low enough for the disk to provide most of the central attraction in the inner galaxy. We present evidence that this conclusion holds for all bright galaxies.},

@article{Dehnen:1998a,
	Abstract = {A parametrized model of the mass distribution within the Milky Way is fitted to the available observational constraints. The most important single parameter is the ratio of the scalelength Rd,* of the stellar disk to R0. The disk and bulge dominate vc(R) at R not greater than about R0 only for Rd,*/R0 not greater than about 0.3. Since the only knowledge we have of the halo derives from studies like the present one, we allow it to contribute to the density at all radii. When allowed this freedom, however, the halo causes changes in assumptions relating to R much less than R0 to affect profoundly the structure of the best-fitting model at R much greater than R0. For example, changing the disk slightly from an exponential surface-density profile significantly changes the form of vc(R) at R much greater than R0, where the disk makes a negligible contribution to vc. Moreover, minor changes in the constraints can cause the halo to develop a deep hole at its center that is not physically plausible. These problems call into question the proposition that flat rotation curves arise because galaxies have physically distinct haloes rather than outward-increasing mass-to-light ratios.},

Measurements of this length scale by large galaxy surveys would allow us to compute the angular diameter distance to and Hubble parameter at the redshifts of the survey. This in turn offers a robust way to measure the acceleration of the universe. I briefly present calculations of the statistical performance from baseline surveys; full details of the methods and results are available in Seo and Eisenstein [ApJ, 598 (2003) 720].

	Abstract = {The kinematic signature of individual spiral arm segments are used here to make a very compact yet quite complete parameterization of the global neutral hydrogen content of M31. Two continuous, trailing spiral arms can be traced from about 0.5 to 27 kpc from the nucleus which accurately account for the kinematic and spatial distribution of gas. The three-dimensional geometry of the gas distribution is derived with only limited assumptions concerning axisymmetry of the velocity field. Significant variations in inclination as a function of azimuth and radius are found, leading to departures of the local midplane from a few hundred pc in a tilted disk in the inner galaxy to in excess of a kpc in the 'warp' of the outer galaxy. The distribution of exponential scale height of the gas with radius varies between 200 and 600 pc, and the spiral pattern in the inner galaxy has an elliptical distortion which leads to significant corrections to the axisymmetric rotation velocity and implied mass distribution.},

	Abstract = {The density profiles and shapes of dark halos are studied using the results of N-body simulations of the gravitational collapse of density peaks. The simulations use from 30,000 to 300,000 particles, which allow density profiles and shapes to be well resolved. The core radius of a typical dark halo is found to be no greater than the softening radius, epsilon = 1.4 kpc. The density profiles can be fitted with an analytical model with an effective power law which varies between -1 in the center to -4 at large radii. The dark halos have circular velocity curves which behave like the circular velocity contribution of the dark component of spiral galaxies inferred from rotation curve decompositions. The halos are strongly triaxial and very flat, with (c/a) = 0.50 and (b/a) = 0.71. There are roughly equal numbers of dark halos with oblate and prolate forms. The distribution of ellipticities in projection for dark halos reaches a maximum at epsilon = 0.5, in contrast to the ellipticity distribution of elliptical galaxies, which peaks at epsilon = 0.2.},

	Abstract = {We use N-body simulations to investigate the structure of dark halos in the standard cold dark matter cosmogony. Halos are excised from simulations of cosmologically representative regions and are resimulated individually at high resolution. We study objects with masses ranging from those of dwarf galaxy halos to those of rich galaxy clusters. The spherically averaged density profiles of all our halos can be fitted over two decades in radius by scaling a simple "universal" profile. The characteristic over- density of a halo, or equivalently its concentration, correlates strongly with halo mass in a way that reflects the mass dependence of the epoch of halo formation. Halo profiles are approximately isothermal over a large range in radii but are significantly shallower than r -2 near the center and steeper than r-2 near the virial radius. Matching the observed rotation curves of disk galaxies requires disk mass-to-light ratios to increase systematically with luminosity. Further, it suggests that the halos of bright galaxies depend only weakly on galaxy luminosity and have circular velocities significantly lower than the disk rotation speed. This may explain why luminosity and dynamics are uncorrelated in observed samples of binary galaxies and of satellite/spiral systems. For galaxy clusters, our halo models are consistent both with the presence of giant arcs and with the observed structure of the intracluster medium, and they suggest a simple explanation for the disparate estimates of cluster core radii found by previous authors. Our results also highlight two shortcomings of the CDM model. CDM halos are too concentrated to be consistent with the halo parameters inferred for dwarf irregulars, and the predicted abundance of galaxy halos is larger than the observed abundance of galaxies. The first problem may imply that the core structure of dwarf galaxies was altered by the galaxy formation process, and the second problem may imply that galaxies failed to form (or remain undetected) in many dark halos.},

	Abstract = {ABSTRACT We present the first spectroscopic analysis of the faint M31 satellite galaxies, AndXI and AndXIII, as well as a re-analysis of existing spectroscopic data for two further faint companions, AndIX (correcting for an error in earlier geometric modelling that caused a misclassification of member stars in previous work) and AndXII. By combining data obtained using the Deep Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph (DEIMOS) mounted on the Keck II telescope with deep photometry from the Suprime-Cam instrument on Subaru, we have identified the most probable members for each of the satellites based on their radial velocities (precise to several down to i ~ 22), distance from the centre of the dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) and their photometric [Fe/H]. Using both the photometric and spectroscopic data, we have also calculated global properties for the dwarfs, such as systemic velocities, metallicities and half-light radii. We find each dwarf to be very metal poor ([Fe/H] ~ -2 both photometrically and spectroscopically, from their stacked spectrum), and as such, they continue to follow the luminosity-metallicity relationship established with brighter dwarfs. We are unable to resolve dispersion for AndXI due to small sample size and low signal-to-noise ratio, but we set a 1sigma upper limit of sigmav < 4.5kms-1. For AndIX, AndXII and AndXIII we resolve velocity dispersions of sigmav = 4.5+3.6-3.4, 2.6+5.1-2.6 and 9.7+8.9-4.5kms-1, though we note that the dispersion for AndXIII is based on just three stars. We derive masses within the half-light radii for these galaxies of 6.2+5.3-5.1 × 106, 2.4+6.5-2.4 × 106 and 1.1+1.4-0.7 × 107Msolar, respectively. We discuss each satellite in the context of the Mateo relations for dSphs, and in reference to the universal halo profiles established for Milky Way dwarfs. Both AndIX and AndXII fall below the universal halo profiles of Walker et al., indicating that they are less massive than would be expected for objects of their half-light radius. When combined with the findings of McConnachie & Irwin, which reveal that the M31 satellites are twice as extended (in terms of both half-light and tidal radii) as their Milky Way counterparts, these results suggest that the satellite population of the Andromeda system could inhabit haloes that with regard to their central densities are significantly different from those of the Milky Way.  The data presented herein were obtained at the W.M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W.M. Keck Foundation.

	Abstract = {ABSTRACT We present a family of robust tracer mass estimators to compute the enclosed mass of galaxy haloes from samples of discrete positional and kinematical data of tracers, such as halo stars, globular clusters and dwarf satellites. The data may be projected positions, distances, line-of-sight velocities or proper motions. The estimators all assume that the tracer population has a scale-free density and moves in a scale-free potential in the region of interest. The circumstances under which the boundary terms can be discarded and the estimator converges are derived. Forms of the estimator tailored for the Milky Way Galaxy and for M31 are given. Monte Carlo simulations are used to quantify the uncertainty as a function of sample size.  For the Milky Way Galaxy, the satellite sample consists of 26 galaxies with line-of-sight velocities. We find that the mass of the Milky Way within 300 kpc is M300 = 0.9 +/- 0.3 × 1012Msolar assuming velocity isotropy. However, the mass estimate is sensitive to the assumed anisotropy and could plausibly lie between 0.7 × 1012 and 3.4 × 1012Msolar, if anisotropies implied by simulations or by the observations are used. Incorporating the proper motions of six Milky Way satellites into the data set, we find M300 = 1.4 +/- 0.3 × 1012Msolar. The range here if plausible anisotropies are used is still broader, from 1.2 × 1012 to 2.7 × 1012Msolar. Note that our error bars only incorporate the statistical uncertainty. There are much greater uncertainties induced by velocity anisotropy and by selection of satellite members.  For M31, there are 23 satellite galaxies with measured line-of-sight velocities, but only M33 and IC 10 have proper motions. We use the line-of-sight velocities and distances of the satellite galaxies to estimate the mass of M31 within 300 kpc as M300 = 1.4 +/- 0.4 × 1012Msolar assuming isotropy. There is only a modest dependence on anisotropy, with the mass varying between 1.3 × 1012 and 1.6 × 1012Msolar. Incorporating the proper motion data set does not change the results significantly. Given the uncertainties, we conclude that the satellite data by themselves yield no reliable insights into which of the two galaxies is actually the more massive.  Leo I has long been known to dominate mass estimates for the Milky Way due to its substantial distance and line-of-sight velocity. We find that And XII and And XIV similarly dominate the estimated mass of M31. As such, we repeat the calculations without these galaxies, in case they are not bound - although on the balance of the evidence, we favour their inclusion in mass calculations.},

@article{Conroy:2009,
	Abstract = {The stellar masses, mean ages, metallicities, and star formation histories of galaxies are now commonly estimated via stellar population synthesis (SPS) techniques. SPS relies on stellar evolution calculations from the main sequence to stellar death, stellar spectral libraries, phenomenological dust models, and stellar initial mass functions (IMFs) to translate the evolution of a multimetallicity, multi-age set of stars into a prediction for the time-evolution of the integrated light from that set of stars. Each of these necessary inputs carries significant uncertainties that have until now received little systematic attention. The present work is the first in a series that explores the impact of uncertainties in key phases of stellar evolution and the IMF on the derived physical properties of galaxies and the expected luminosity evolution for a passively evolving set of stars. A Monte Carlo Markov Chain approach is taken to fit near-UV through near-IR photometry of a representative sample of low- and high-redshift galaxies with this new SPS model. Significant results include the following. (1) Including uncertainties in stellar evolution, stellar masses at z ~ 0 carry errors of ~0.3 dex at 95% CL with little dependence on luminosity or color, while at z ~ 2, the masses of bright red galaxies are uncertain at the ~0.6 dex level. (2) Either current stellar evolution models, current observational stellar libraries, or both, do not adequately characterize the metallicity-dependence of the thermally pulsating AGB phase. (3) Conservative estimates on the uncertainty of the slope of the IMF in the solar neighborhood imply that luminosity evolution per unit redshift is uncertain at the ~0.4 mag level in the K band, which is a substantial source of uncertainty for interpreting the evolution of galaxy populations across time. Any possible evolution in the IMF, as suggested by several independent lines of evidence, will only exacerbate this problem. (4) Assuming a distribution of stellar metallicities within a galaxy, rather than a fixed value as is usually assumed, can yield important differences when considering bands blueward of V, but is not a concern for redder bands. Spectroscopic information may alleviate some of these concerns, though uncertainties in the stellar spectral libraries and the importance of nonsolar abundance ratios have not yet been systematically investigated in the SPS context.},

	Abstract = {We have discovered 21 new Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and have used them to trace the history of cosmic expansion over the last 10 billion yr. These objects, which include 13 spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia at z>=1, were discovered during 14 epochs of reimaging of the GOODS fields North and South over 2 yr with the Advanced Camera for Surveys on  HST. Together with a recalibration of our previous HST-discovered SNe Ia, the full sample of 23 SNe Ia at z>=1 provides the highest redshift sample known. Combining these data with previous SN Ia data sets, we measured H(z) at discrete, uncorrelated epochs, reducing the uncertainty of H(z>1) from 50% to under 20%, strengthening the evidence for a cosmic jerk-the transition from deceleration in the past to acceleration in the present. The unique leverage of the HST high-redshift SNe Ia provides the first meaningful constraint on the dark energy equation-of-state parameter at z>=1. The result remains consistent with a cosmological constant [w(z)=-1] and rules out rapidly evolving dark energy (dw/dz>>1). The defining property of dark energy, its negative pressure, appears to be present at z>1, in the epoch preceding acceleration, with ~98% confidence in our primary fit. Moreover, the z>1 sample-averaged spectral energy distribution is consistent with that of the typical SN Ia over the last 10 Gyr, indicating that any spectral evolution of the properties of SNe Ia with redshift is still below our detection threshold.

	Abstract = {We describe a sampling method to estimate the polarized cosmic microwave background (CMB) signal from observed maps of the sky. We use a Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm to estimate the polarized CMB map, containing Q and U Stokes parameters at each pixel, and its covariance matrix. These can be used as inputs for cosmological analyses. The polarized sky signal is parameterized as the sum of three components: CMB, synchrotron emission, and thermal dust emission. The polarized Galactic components are modeled with spatially varying power-law spectral indices for the synchrotron, and a fixed power law for the dust, and their component maps are estimated as by-products. We apply the method to simulated low-resolution maps with pixels of side 7.2 deg, using diagonal and full noise realizations drawn from the WMAP noise matrices. The CMB maps are recovered with goodness of fit consistent with errors. Computing the likelihood of the E-mode power in the maps as a function of optical depth to reionization, tau, for fixed temperature anisotropy power, we recover tau = 0.091 $\pm$ 0.019 for a simulation with input tau = 0.1, and mean tau = 0.098 averaged over 10 simulations. A "null" simulation with no polarized CMB signal has maximum likelihood consistent with tau = 0. The method is applied to the five-year WMAP data, using the K, Ka, Q, and V channels. We find tau = 0.090 $\pm$ 0.019, compared to tau = 0.086 $\pm$ 0.016 from the template-cleaned maps used in the primary WMAP analysis. The synchrotron spectral index, beta, averaged over high signal-to-noise pixels with standard deviation sigma(beta) < 0.25, but excluding ~6% of the sky masked in the Galactic plane, is -3.03 $\pm$ 0.04. This estimate does not vary significantly with Galactic latitude, although includes an informative prior.  WMAP is the result of a partnership between Princeton University and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Scientific guidance is provided by the WMAP Science Team.},

	Abstract = {We present a new catalog of photometric and spectroscopic data on M31 globular clusters (GCs). The catalog includes new optical and near-infrared photometry for a substantial fraction of the 435 clusters and cluster candidates. We use these data to determine the reddening and intrinsic colors of individual clusters, and we find that the extinction laws in the Galaxy and M31 are not significantly different. There are significant (up to 0.2 mag in V-K) offsets between the clusters' intrinsic colors and simple stellar population colors predicted by population synthesis models; we suggest that these are due to systematic errors in the models. The distributions of M31 clusters' metallicities and metallicity-sensitive colors are bimodal, with peaks at [Fe/H]~-1.4 and -0.6. The distribution of V-I is often bimodal in elliptical galaxies' globular cluster systems, but it is not sensitive enough to metallicity to show bimodality in M31 and Galactic cluster systems. The radial distribution and kinematics of the two M31 metallicity groups imply that they are analogs of the Galactic ``halo'' and ``disk/bulge'' cluster systems. The globular clusters in M31 have a small radial metallicity gradient, suggesting that some dissipation occurred during the formation of the globular cluster system. The lack of correlation between cluster luminosity and metallicity in M31 GCs shows that self-enrichment is not important in GC formation. Work reported here based on observations made with the Multiple Mirror Telescope, a joint facility of the Smithsonian Institution and the University of Arizona.},

	Abstract = {A simple analytic mode of the response of dark matter halos to the dissipative infall of the luminous material to form an exponential disk is used to explore the dependence of the final rotation curves on all the relevant parameters: the ratio of the dissipative baryonic mass to the total galaxy mass, including dark matter; the ratio of the disk exponential scale length to the truncation radius; the core radius of the isothermal halo in the absence of dissipation; and the dimensionless angular momentum parameter. Particular attention is given to the final rotation curves expected in the tidal torque theory of angular momentum, in which (lambda) is about 0.05. For F of about 0.05 the dispersion in lambda expected in the tidal torque theory, 0.02-0.1, leads to rotation curves for bright galaxies whose systematics are much like those of galaxies for which H I data are available when consistent baryonic disk-scale lengths are used throughout. The mass inside R(H) exhibits a spread of values consistent with observations except possibly for the smallest galaxies, which may have suffered significant loss.},

	Abstract = {Varied evidence suggests that galaxies consist of roughly 10 percent baryonic matter by mass and that baryons sink dissipatively by about a factor of 10 in. radius during galaxy formation. It is shown that such infall strongly perturbs the underlying dark matter distribution, pulling it inward and creating cores that are considerably smaller and denser than would have evolved without dissipation. Any discontinuity between the baryonic and dark matter mass distributions is smoothed out by the coupled motions of the two components. If dark halos have large core radii in the absence of dissipation, the above infall scenario yields rotation curves that are flat over large distances, in agreement with observations of spiral galaxies. Such large dissipationless cores may plausibly result from large internal kinetic energy in protogalaxies at maximum expansion, perhaps as a result of subclustering, tidal effects, or anisotropic collapse.},

	Abstract = {Two studies have recently reported the discovery of pronounced halo substructure in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) commissioning data. Here we show that this halo substructure is, almost in its entirety, due to the expected tidal stream torn off the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy during the course of its many close encounters with the Milky Way. This interpretation makes strong predictions on the kinematics and distances of these stream stars. Comparison of the structure in old horizontal branch stars, detected by the SDSS team, with the carbon star structure discovered in our own survey, indicates that this halo stream is of comparable age to the Milky Way. It would appear that the Milky Way and the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy have been a strongly interacting system for most of their existence. Once complete, the SDSS will provide a unique data set with which to constrain the dynamical evolution of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy; it will also strongly constrain the mass distribution of the outer Milky Way.},

An attractive feature of this cold dark matter hypothesis is its considerable predictive power: the post-recombination fluctuation spectrum is calculable, and it in turn governs the formation of galaxies and clusters. Good agreement with the data is obtained for a Zeldovich spectrum of primordial fluctuations.},

If a certain modified version of the Newtonian dynamics is used to describe the motion of bodies in a gravitational field (of a galaxy, say), the observational results are reproduced with no need to assume hidden mass in appreciable quantities. Various characteristics of galaxies result with no further assumptions. The basis of the modification is the assumption that in the limit of small acceleration a very low a0, the acceleration of a particle at distance r from a mass M satisfies approximately a2/a0 ≈ MGr-2, where a0 is a constant of the dimensions of an acceleration.},

@article{Bullock:2001,
	Abstract = {We study dark matter halo density profiles in a high-resolution N-body simulation of a LambdaCDM cosmology. Our statistical sample contains ~5000 haloes in the range 1011-1014h-1Msolar, and the resolution allows a study of subhaloes inside host haloes. The profiles are parametrized by an NFW form with two parameters, an inner radius rs and a virial radius Rvir, and we define the halo concentration cvir≡Rvirrs. First, we find that, for a given halo mass, the redshift dependence of the median concentration is cvir~(1+z)-1. This corresponds to rs(z)~constant, and is contrary to earlier suspicions that cvir does not vary much with redshift. The implications are that high-redshift galaxies are predicted to be more extended and dimmer than expected before. Secondly, we find that the scatter in halo profiles is large, with a 1sigma Delta(logcvir)=0.18 at a given mass, corresponding to a scatter in maximum rotation velocities of DeltaVmaxVmax=0.12. We discuss implications for modelling the Tully-Fisher relation, which has a smaller reported intrinsic scatter. Thirdly, subhaloes and haloes in dense environments tend to be more concentrated than isolated haloes, and show a larger scatter. These results suggest that cvir is an essential parameter for the theory of galaxy modelling, and we briefly discuss implications for the universality of the Tully-Fisher relation, the formation of low surface brightness galaxies, and the origin of the Hubble sequence. We present an improved analytic treatment of halo formation that fits the measured relations between halo parameters and their redshift dependence, and can thus serve semi-analytic studies of galaxy formation.},

	Abstract = {The Hypervelocity Star survey presents the currently largest sample of radial velocity measurements of halo stars out to 80 kpc. We apply spherical Jeans modeling to these data in order to derive the mass profile of the Galaxy. We restrict the analysis to distances larger than 25 kpc from the Galactic center, where the density profile of halo stars is well approximated by a single power law with logarithmic slope between -3.5 and -4.5. With this restriction, we also avoid the complication of modeling a flattened Galactic disk. In the range 25 < r < 80 kpc, the radial velocity dispersion declines remarkably little; a robust measure of its logarithmic slope is between -0.05 and -0.1. The circular velocity profile also declines remarkably little with radius. The allowed range of V_c(80 kpc) lies between 175 and 231 km/s, with the most likely value 193 km/s. Compared with the value at the solar location, the Galactic circular velocity declines by less than 20% over an order of magnitude in radius. Such a flat profile requires a massive and extended dark matter halo. The mass enclosed within 80 kpc is 6.9(+3.0-1.2) 10^11 Msun. Our sample of radial velocities is large enough that the biggest uncertainty in the mass is not statistical but systematic, dominated by the density slope and anisotropy of the tracer population. Further progress requires modeling observed datasets within realistic simulations of galaxy formation.},

	Abstract = {The quadrupolar component of the gravitational field due to neighboring galaxies at the barycenter of the Local Group is estimated. The tidal effect consists of an almost equal compression and extension along two principal axes, and of almost no effect along the third. The positive axis of the quadrupole component is aligned with the dipole component for galaxies within 10 Mpc of the Local Group. The nature of the binary orbit of the Andromeda galaxy and the Milky Way in the presence of this tidal field is investigated, and possible orbits are suggested. Though the tidal effects are appreciably strong, they hardly affect the mass of the Local Group derived from timing arguments. The direction along which Andromeda seems to have emerged from the Big Bang indicates that it was responsible for the orbit of the Magellanic Clouds about the Galaxy. The proper motion of Andromeda is predicted.},

The first part of the present paper examines further probabilistic properties of the distribution, with special emphasis on aspects of statistical relevance. Inferential and other statistical issues are discussed in the following part, with applications to some multivariate statistics problems, illustrated by numerical examples. Finally, a further extension is described which introduces a skewing factor of an elliptical density.},

@article{Gillessen:2009,
	Abstract = {We present the results of 16 years of monitoring stellar orbits around the massive black hole in the center of the Milky Way, using high-resolution near-infrared techniques. This work refines our previous analysis mainly by greatly improving the definition of the coordinate system, which reaches a long-term astrometric accuracy of ≈300 muas, and by investigating in detail the individual systematic error contributions. The combination of a long-time baseline and the excellent astrometric accuracy of adaptive optics data allows us to determine orbits of 28 stars, including the star S2, which has completed a full revolution since our monitoring began. Our main results are: all stellar orbits are fit extremely well by a single-point-mass potential to within the astrometric uncertainties, which are now ≈6× better than in previous studies. The central object mass is (4.31\, \pm\, 0.06|_\mathrm{stat}\,\pm\, 0.36|_{R_0})\times 10^6 M_\odot, where the fractional statistical error of 1.5% is nearly independent from R 0, and the main uncertainty is due to the uncertainty in R 0. Our current best estimate for the distance to the Galactic center is R 0 = 8.33 $\pm$ 0.35 kpc. The dominant errors in this value are systematic. The mass scales with distance as (3.95 $\pm$ 0.06) × 106(R 0/8 kpc)2.19 M sun. The orientations of orbital angular momenta for stars in the central arcsecond are random. We identify six of the stars with orbital solutions as late-type stars, and six early-type stars as members of the clockwise-rotating disk system, as was previously proposed. We constrain the extended dark mass enclosed between the pericenter and apocenter of S2 at less than 0.066, at the 99% confidence level, of the mass of Sgr A*. This is two orders of magnitudes larger than what one would expect from other theoretical and observational estimates.},

@article{Ghez:2008,
	Abstract = {We report new precision measurements of the properties of our Galaxy's supermassive black hole. Based on astrometric (1995-2007) and radial velocity (RV; 2000-2007) measurements from the W. M. Keck 10 m telescopes, a fully unconstrained Keplerian orbit for the short-period star S0-2 provides values for the distance (R0) of 8.0+/-0.6 kpc, the enclosed mass (Mbh) of 4.1+/-0.6×106 Msolar, and the black hole's RV, which is consistent with zero with 30 km s-1 uncertainty. If the black hole is assumed to be at rest with respect to the Galaxy (e.g., has no massive companion to induce motion), we can further constrain the fit, obtaining R0=8.4+/-0.4 kpc and Mbh=4.5+/-0.4×106 Msolar. More complex models constrain the extended dark mass distribution to be less than 3-4×105 Msolar within 0.01 pc, ~100 times higher than predictions from stellar and stellar remnant models. For all models, we identify transient astrometric shifts from source confusion (up to 5 times the astrometric error) and the assumptions regarding the black hole's radial motion as previously unrecognized limitations on orbital accuracy and the usefulness of fainter stars. Future astrometric and RV observations will remedy these effects. Our estimates of R0 and the Galaxy's local rotation speed, which it is derived from combining R0 with the apparent proper motion of Sgr A*, (theta0=229+/-18 km s-1), are compatible with measurements made using other methods. The increased black hole mass found in this study, compared to that determined using projected mass estimators, implies a longer period for the innermost stable orbit, longer resonant relaxation timescales for stars in the vicinity of the black hole and a better agreement with the Mbh-sigma relation.},

	Abstract = {We report on the discovery of three new dwarf galaxies in the Local Group. These galaxies are found in new CFHT/MegaPrime g,i imaging of the southwestern quadrant of M31, extending our extant survey area to include the majority of the southern hemisphere of M31's halo out to 150 kpc. All these galaxies have stellar populations which appear typical of dwarf spheroidal (dSph) systems. The first of these galaxies, Andromeda XVIII, is the most distant Local Group dwarf discovered in recent years, at ~1.4 Mpc from the Milky Way (~600 kpc from M31). The second galaxy, Andromeda XIX, a satellite of M31, is the most extended dwarf galaxy known in the Local Group, with a half-light radius of rh~1.7 kpc. This is approximately an order of magnitude larger than the typical half-light radius of many Milky Way dSphs, and reinforces the difference in scale sizes seen between the Milky Way and M31 dSphs (such that the M31 dwarfs are generally more extended than their Milky Way counterparts). The third galaxy, Andromeda XX, is one of the faintest galaxies so far discovered in the vicinity of M31, with an absolute magnitude of order MV~-6.3. Andromeda XVIII, XIX, and XX highlight different aspects of, and raise important questions regarding, the formation and evolution of galaxies at the extreme faint end of the luminosity function. These findings indicate that we have not yet sampled the full parameter space occupied by dwarf galaxies, although this is an essential prerequisite for successfully and consistently linking these systems to the predicted cosmological dark matter substructure.},

	Abstract = {One hundred and nine new globular cluster candidates around M31 have been identified on the Canada-France-Hawaii telescope (CFHT) prime-focus slitless spectra plates. All previously recognized clusters (Sargent, et al., 1977; Vetesnick, 1962; and Battistini et al., 1980) were examined on the plates, and a compilation made of 509 objects which have the appearance and spectra of globular clusters. Of these objects, 408 have colors typical of globular clusters in the Galaxy. Methods were devised to estimate the core radii and intrinsic colors of most of the 509 clusters. The characteristics of the globular cluster systems of M31 and the Galaxy are very similar. In particular, the radial frequency distributions and the core radii distributions of the two systems are virtually identical. The mean luminosity of globular clusters decreases significantly with increasing galactocentric distance; the clusters with projected distances from the nucleus greater than 10 kpc are, in the mean, 0.7 mag fainter than those closer to the center. There is no evidence of a radial color gradient in the data, which extend, however, to only about 25 kpc, mainly along the major axis.},

	Abstract = {We review the current theory of how galaxies form within the cosmological framework provided by the cold dark matter paradigm for structure formation. Beginning with the pre-galactic evolution of baryonic material we describe the analytical and numerical understanding of how baryons condense into galaxies, what determines the structure of those galaxies and how internal and external processes (including star formation, merging, active galactic nuclei etc.) determine their gross properties and evolution. Throughout, we highlight successes and failings of current galaxy formation theory. We include a review of computational implementations of galaxy formation theory and assess their ability to provide reliable modelling of this complex phenomenon. We finish with a discussion of several "hot topics" in contemporary galaxy formation theory and assess future directions for this field.},

@article{Bell:2001,
	Abstract = {We have used a suite of simplified spectrophotometric spiral galaxy evolution models to argue that there are substantial variations in stellar mass-to-light (M/L) ratios within and among galaxies, amounting to factors of between 3 and 7 in the optical and factors of 2 in the near-infrared. Our models show a strong correlation between stellar M/L and the optical colors of the integrated stellar populations. Under the assumption of a universal spiral galaxy initial mass function (IMF), relative trends in model stellar M/L with color are robust to uncertainties in stellar population and galaxy evolution modeling, including the effects of modest bursts of star formation. Errors in the dust-reddening estimates do not strongly affect the final derived stellar masses of a stellar population. We examine the observed maximum disk stellar M/L ratios of a sample of spiral galaxies with accurate rotation curves and optical and near-infrared luminosity profiles. From these observed maximum disk M/L ratios we conclude that a Salpeter IMF has too many low-mass stars per unit luminosity but that an IMF similar to the Salpeter IMF at the high-mass end with less low-mass stars (giving stellar M/L ratios 30% lower than the Salpeter value) is consistent with the maximum disk constraints. Trends in observed maximum disk stellar M/L ratios with color provide a good match to the predicted model relation, suggesting that the spiral galaxy stellar IMF is universal and that a fraction of (particularly high surface brightness) spiral galaxies may be close to maximum disk. We apply the model trends in stellar M/L ratio with color to the Tully-Fisher (T-F) relation. We find that the stellar mass T-F relation is relatively steep, has modest scatter, and is independent of the passband and color used to derive the stellar masses, again lending support for a universal IMF. The difference in slope between the optical (especially blue) and near-infrared T-F relations is due to the combined effects of dust attenuation and stellar M/L variations with galaxy mass. Assuming the Hubble Space Telescope Key Project distance to the Ursa Major Cluster and neglecting the (uncertain) molecular gas fraction, we find that the baryonic T-F relation takes the form Mbaryon~V3.5 (with random and systematic 1 sigma slope errors of ~0.2 each) when using a bisector fit and rotation velocities derived from the flat part of the rotation curve. Since we have normalized the stellar M/L ratios to be as high as can possibly be allowed by maximum disk constraints, the slope of the baryonic T-F relation will be somewhat shallower than 3.5 if all disks are substantially submaximal.},

	Abstract = {We use the very large Millennium Simulation of the concordance Lambda cold dark matter cosmogony to calibrate the bias and error distribution of Timing Argument estimators of the masses of the Local Group and of the Milky Way. From a large number of isolated spiral-spiral pairs similar to the Milky Way/Andromeda system, we find the interquartile range of the ratio of timing mass to true mass to be a factor of 1.8, while the 5 and 95 per cent points of the distribution of this ratio are separated by a factor of 5.7. Here, we define true mass as the sum of the `virial' masses, M200, of the two dominant galaxies. For present best values of the distance and approach velocity of Andromeda, this leads to a median likelihood estimate of the true mass of the Local Group of 5.27 × 1012Msolar or logMLG/Msolar = 12.72, with an interquartile range of [12.58, 12.83] and a 5-95 per cent range of [12.26, 13.01]. Thus, a 95 per cent lower confidence limit on the true mass of the Local Group is 1.81 × 1012Msolar. A timing estimate of the Milky Way's mass based on the large recession velocity observed for the distant satellite Leo I works equally well, although with larger systematic uncertainties. It gives an estimated virial mass for the Milky Way of 2.43 × 1012Msolar with a 95 per cent lower confidence limit of 0.80 × 1012Msolar.},

	Abstract = {The authors present full two-dimensional photographic photometry of the nearby spiral galaxy M31 in various colors. They describe the reduction and calibration of the data, as well as a method used to remove the thousands of foreground stars that contaminate the image of the galaxy. Extensive comparisons of these data with published photometric scans show that the blue light intensity of the galaxy is reliable measured out to about 20 kpc radius. Color maps with a typical uncertainty between 0.1 and 0.2 mag were obtained over the main part of the bulge and disk out to 14 kpc radius. Tables listing the intensity and color profiles along the principal axes of the galaxy are presented, together with global profiles in U, B, V, and R out to 24 kpc radius. Two-dimensional color maps, smoothed to a resolution of 40arcsec, show the major dust lanes and a relatively bluer color in the ring of Population I material around 10 kpc radius. The colors are characteristic for an old stellar population. The isophotes of the dwarf elliptical companion NGC 205 are strongly twisted, suggesting tidal interaction between the elliptical and M31.},

@article{Wolf:2010,
	Abstract = {We derive an accurate mass estimator for dispersion-supported stellar systems and demonstrate its validity by analysing resolved line-of-sight velocity data for globular clusters, dwarf galaxies and elliptical galaxies. Specifically, by manipulating the spherical Jeans equation we show that the mass enclosed within the 3D deprojected half-light radius r1/2 can be determined with only mild assumptions about the spatial variation of the stellar velocity dispersion anisotropy as long as the projected velocity dispersion profile is fairly flat near the half-light radius, as is typically observed. We find M1/2 = 3 G-1< sigma2los > r1/2 ~= 4 G-1< sigma2los > Re, where < sigma2los > is the luminosity-weighted square of the line-of-sight velocity dispersion and Re is the 2D projected half-light radius. While deceptively familiar in form, this formula is not the virial theorem, which cannot be used to determine accurate masses unless the radial profile of the total mass is known a priori. We utilize this finding to show that all of the Milky Way dwarf spheroidal galaxies (MW dSphs) are consistent with having formed within a halo of a mass of approximately 3 × 109 Msolar, assuming a Lambda cold dark matter cosmology. The faintest MW dSphs seem to have formed in dark matter haloes that are at least as massive as those of the brightest MW dSphs, despite the almost five orders of magnitude spread in luminosity between them. We expand our analysis to the full range of observed dispersion-supported stellar systems and examine their dynamical I-band mass-to-light ratios UpsilonI1/2. The UpsilonI1/2 versus M1/2 relation for dispersion-supported galaxies follows a U shape, with a broad minimum near UpsilonI1/2 ~= 3 that spans dwarf elliptical galaxies to normal ellipticals, a steep rise to UpsilonI1/2 ~= 3200 for ultra-faint dSphs and a more shallow rise to UpsilonI1/2 ~= 800 for galaxy cluster spheroids.},

	Abstract = {In hierarchical cosmological models, galaxies grow in mass through the continual accretion of smaller ones. The tidal disruption of these systems is expected to result in loosely bound stars surrounding the galaxy, at distances that reach $10 - 100$ times the radius of the central disk. The number, luminosity and morphology of the relics of this process provide significant clues to galaxy formation history, but obtaining a comprehensive survey of these components is difficult because of their intrinsic faintness and vast extent. Here we report a panoramic survey of the Andromeda galaxy (M31). We detect stars and coherent structures that are almost certainly remnants of dwarf galaxies destroyed by the tidal field of M31. An improved census of their surviving counterparts implies that three-quarters of M31's satellites brighter than $M_V < -6$ await discovery. The brightest companion, Triangulum (M33), is surrounded by a stellar structure that provides persuasive evidence for a recent encounter with M31. This panorama of galaxy structure directly confirms the basic tenets of the hierarchical galaxy formation model and reveals the shared history of M31 and M33 in the unceasing build-up of galaxies.},

	Abstract = {The present study of the rotation and velocity dispersion fields of the stellar component of the bulge region of M31 indicates that the Fourier quotient technique is useful in the determination of velocities and their dispersions, even on photographic spectra. An apparent symmetry is found to be present in the rotation curves in the region whose R value is less than 10 arcsec. The position of discrete dust features shown on enhanced photography correlates with small perturbations in the rotation curves. The gas and stellar components have different intrinsic rotational velocities in the bulge, suggesting only weak coupling, if any, between the two systems. No clear dynamical evidence is noted for the presence of a barlike structure in the bulge of M31.},

	Abstract = {(Abridged) We present the angular power spectra derived from the 7-year maps and discuss the cosmological conclusions that can be inferred from WMAP data alone. The third acoustic peak in the TT spectrum is now well measured by WMAP. In the context of a flat LambdaCDM model, this improvement allows us to place tighter constraints on the matter density from WMAP data alone, and on the epoch of matter-radiation equality, The temperature-polarization (TE) spectrum is detected in the 7-year data with a significance of 21 sigma, compared to 13 sigma with the 5-year data. The low-l EE spectrum, a measure of the optical depth due to reionization, is detected at 5.5 sigma significance when averaged over l = 2-7. The BB spectrum, an important probe of gravitational waves from inflation, remains consistent with zero. The upper limit on tensor modes from polarization data alone is a factor of 2 lower with the 7-year data than it was using the 5-year data (Komatsu et al. 2010). We test the parameter recovery process for bias and find that the scalar spectral index, ns, is biased high, but only by 0.13 sigma, while the remaining parameters are biased by < 0.15 sigma. The improvement in the third peak measurement leads to tighter lower limits from WMAP on the number of relativistic degrees of freedom (e.g., neutrinos) in the early universe: Neff > 2.7 (95% CL). Also, using WMAP data alone, the primordial helium mass fraction is found to be YHe = 0.28+0.14-0.15, and with data from higher-resolution CMB experiments included, we now establish the existence of pre-stellar helium at > 3 sigma (Komatsu et al. 2010).},

@article{Puglielli:2010,
	Abstract = {We use Bayesian statistics and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques to construct dynamical models for the spiral galaxy NGC 6503. The constraints include surface brightness (SB) profiles which display a Freeman Type II structure; H I and ionized gas rotation curves; the stellar rotation, which is nearly coincident with the ionized gas curve; and the line of sight stellar dispersion, which displays a sigma-drop at the center. The galaxy models consist of a S{\'e}rsic bulge, an exponential disk with an optional inner truncation and a cosmologically motivated dark halo. The Bayesian/MCMC technique yields the joint posterior probability distribution function for the input parameters, allowing constraints on model parameters such as the halo cusp strength, structural parameters for the disk and bulge, and mass-to-light ratios. We examine several interpretations of the data: the Type II SB profile may be due to dust extinction, to an inner truncated disk, or to a ring of bright stars, and we test separate fits to the gas and stellar rotation curves to determine if the gas traces the gravitational potential. We test each of these scenarios for bar stability, ruling out dust extinction. We also find that the gas likely does not trace the gravitational potential, since the predicted stellar rotation curve, which includes asymmetric drift, is then inconsistent with the observed stellar rotation curve. The disk is well fit by an inner-truncated profile, but the possibility of ring formation by a bar to reproduce the Type II profile is also a realistic model. We further find that the halo must have a cuspy profile with gamma >~ 1; the bulge has a lower M/L than the disk, suggesting a star-forming component in the center of the galaxy; and the bulge, as expected for this late-type galaxy, has a low S{\'e}rsic index with nb ~ 1-2, suggesting a formation history dominated by secular evolution.},

	Abstract = {We report the systematic detection of magnetic fields in massive (M > 5 M$_\odot$) late-type supergiants, using spectropolarimetric observations obtained with ESPaDOnS at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. Our observations reveal detectable Stokes V Zeeman signatures in Least-Squares Deconvolved mean line profiles in one-third of the observed sample of more than 30 stars. The signatures are sometimes complex, revealing multiple reversals across the line. The corresponding longitudinal magnetic field is seldom detected, although our longitudinal field error bars are typically 0.3 G ($1\sigma$). These characteristics suggest topologically complex magnetic fields, presumably generated by dynamo action. The Stokes V signatures of some targets show clear time variability, indicating either rotational modulation or intrinsic evolution of the magnetic field. We also observe a weak correlation between the unsigned longitudinal magnetic field and the CaII K core emission equivalent width of the active G2Iab supergiant $\beta$~Dra and the G8Ib supergiant $\epsilon$~Gem.},

	Abstract = {A major uncertainty in the dynamical history of the Local Group of galaxies originates from the unknown transverse speed of the Andromeda galaxy (M31) relative to the Milky Way. We show that the recent VLBA measurement of the proper motion of Andromeda's satellite, M33, severely constrains the possible values of M31's proper motion. The condition that M33's stellar disk has not been tidally disrupted by either M31 or the Milky Way over the past 10 billion years favors a proper motion amplitude of 100+/-20 km s-1 for M31 with the quadrant of a negative velocity component along right ascension and a positive component along declination strongly ruled out. This inference can be tested by future astrometric measurements with SIM, Gaia, or the SKA. Our results imply that the dark halos of Andromeda and the Milky Way will pass through each other within the next 5-10 billion years.},

	Abstract = {We have identified in the 2MASS database 693 known and candidate globular clusters in M 31. The 2MASS J, H, K magnitudes of these objects have been transformed to the same homogeneous photometric system of existing near infrared photometry of M 31 globulars, finally yielding J, H, K integrated photometry for 279 confirmed M 31 clusters, 406 unconfirmed candidates and 8 objects with controversial classification. Of these objects 529 lacked any previous estimate of their near infrared magnitudes. The newly assembled near infrared dataset has been implemented into a revised version of the Bologna Catalogue of M 31 globulars, with updated optical (UBVRI) photometry taken, when possible, from the most recent sources of CCD photometry available in the literature and transformed to a common photometric system. The final Revised Bologna Catalogue (available in electronic form) is the most comprehensive list presently available of confirmed and candidate M 31 globular clusters, with a total of 1164 entries. In particular, it includes 337 confirmed GCs, 688 GC candidates, 10 objects with controversial classification, 70 confirmed galaxies, 55 confirmed stars, and 4 H II regions lying within ˜3$\,^{\circ}$ from the center of the M 31 galaxy. Using the newly assembled database we show that the V-K color provides a powerful tool to discriminate between M 31 clusters and background galaxies, and we identify a sample of 83 globular cluster candidates, which is not likely to be contaminated by misclassified galaxies.

	Abstract = {In the course of our survey of the outer halo of the Andromeda galaxy we have discovered a remote, possible satellite of that system at a projected 162 kpc (11.7$\,^{\circ}$) radius. The fairly elongated (0.31+/-0.09 ellipticity) dwarf can be fit with a King profile of 1.07 kpc (d/784 kpc) limiting radius, where the satellite distance, d, is estimated at ~630-850 kpc from the tip of the red giant branch. The newfound galaxy, ``Andromeda XIV'' (``And XIV''), distinguishes itself from other Local Group galaxies by its extreme dynamics; Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopy reveals it to have a large heliocentric radial velocity (-481 km s-1), or -206 km s-1 velocity relative to M31. Even at its projected radius And XIV already is at the M31 escape velocity based on the latest M31 mass models. If And XIV is bound to M31, then recent models with reduced M31 virial masses need revision upward. If not bound to M31, then And XIV is just now falling into the Local Group for the first time and represents a dwarf galaxy that formed and spent almost its entire life in isolation.},

	Abstract = {We present the results of a spectroscopic survey of the recently discovered M31 satellites AndXV and AndXVI, lying at projected distances from the centre of M31 of 93 and 130 kpc, respectively. These satellites lie to the south of M31, in regions of the stellar halo which wide-field imaging has revealed as relative voids (compared to the ~degree-scale coherent stream-like structures). Using the Deep Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph mounted on the Keck II telescope, we have defined probable members of these satellites, for which we derive radial velocities as precise as ~6kms-1 down to i ~ 21.5. While the distance to AndXVI remains the same as previously reported (525 +/- 50 kpc), we have demonstrated that the brightest three stars previously used to define the tip of the red giant branch in AndXV are in fact Galactic, and AndXV is actually likely to be much more distant at 770 +/- 70 kpc (compared to the previous 630 kpc), increasing the luminosity from MV ~ -9.4 to -9.8. The AndXV velocity dispersion is resolved with vr = -339+7-6kms-1 and sigmav = 11+7-5kms-1. The AndXVI dispersion is not quite resolved at 1sigma with vr = -385+5-6kms-1 and sigma = 0+10-indef kms-1. Using the photometry of the confirmed member stars, we find metallicities of AndXV (median [Fe/H] = -1.58, interquartile range +/-0.08) and AndXVI (median [Fe/H] = -2.23, interquartile range +/-0.12). Stacking the spectra of the member stars, we find spectroscopic [Fe/H] = -1.8 (-2.1) for AndXV (AndXVI), with an uncertainty of ~0.2 dex in both cases. Our measurements of AndXV reasonably resolve its mass (~108Msolar) and suggest a polar orbit, while the velocity of AndXVI suggests it is approaching the M31 escape velocity given its large M31 centric distance.},

	Abstract = {The velocity distribution of nearby stars (lsim100 pc) contains many overdensities or "moving groups," clumps of comoving stars, that are inconsistent with the standard assumption of an axisymmetric, time-independent, and steady-state Galaxy. We study the age and metallicity properties of the low-velocity moving groups based on the reconstruction of the local velocity distribution in Paper I of this series. We perform stringent, conservative hypothesis testing to establish for each of these moving groups whether it could conceivably consist of a coeval population of stars. We conclude that they do not: the moving groups are neither trivially associated with their eponymous open clusters nor with any other inhomogeneous star formation event. Concerning a possible dynamical origin of the moving groups, we test whether any of the moving groups has a higher or lower metallicity than the background population of thin disk stars, as would generically be the case if the moving groups are associated with resonances of the bar or spiral structure. We find clear evidence that the Hyades moving group has higher than average metallicity and weak evidence that the Sirius moving group has lower than average metallicity, which could indicate that these two groups are related to the inner Lindblad resonance of the spiral structure. Further, we find weak evidence that the Hercules moving group has higher than average metallicity, as would be the case if it is associated with the bar's outer Lindblad resonance. The Pleiades moving group shows no clear metallicity anomaly, arguing against a common dynamical origin for the Hyades and Pleiades groups. Overall, however, the moving groups are barely distinguishable from the background population of stars, raising the likelihood that the moving groups are associated with transient perturbations.},

Our Bayesian approach, symmetric in all observations, is the foundation of a unified framework for object matching, where not only spatial information, but also physical properties, such as colors, redshift, and luminosity, can be considered in a natural way. We provide a practical recipe to implement an efficient recursive algorithm to evaluate the Bayes factor over a set of catalogs with known circular errors in positions. This new methodology is crucial for studies leveraging the synergy of today's multiwavelength observations and to enter the time domain science of the upcoming survey telescopes.},

	Abstract = {The isotropic spherical galaxies are examined to determine specific properties of the systems including the exponential differential energy distribution and the applicability of the Vaucouleurs law. Stellar systems that follow the R exp 1/m law are assumed to have constant mass-to-light ratios and to be spherically symmetrical and isotropic in terms of the velocity dispersion tensor. Calculations are presented of the assumed surface-brightness profile, the spatial luminosity and density, and the line-of-sight velocity dispersion for values of m ranging from 2 to 10. The dimensionless distribution function and the normalized differential energy distribution (DED) are developed and given. The results show that the distribution function is never negative for the systems, and the exponential behavior of the DED is a common property of these stellar systems. The fraction of stellar mass within the Boltzmann range is found to depend on the parameter m and relate to the Vaucouleurs law maximum (m = 4).},

	Abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of a disc galaxy forming in a high-resolution fully cosmological simulation to investigate the nature of the outer regions of discs and their relevance for the disc formation process. Specifically, we focus on the phenomenon of misaligned disc components and find that the outer disc warp is a consequence of the misalignment between the inner disc and the surrounding hot gaseous halo. As the infalling cold gas sinks toward the centre of the galaxy, it is strongly torqued by the hot gas halo. By the time the fresh gas reaches the central disc-forming region its angular momentum is completely aligned with the spin of the hot gas halo. If the spin of the hot gas halo, in turn, is not aligned with that of the inner disc, a misaligned outer disc forms comprised of newly accreted material. The inner and outer components are misaligned with each other because they respond differently to infalling substructure and accretion. The warped disc feeds the main gas disc due to viscous angular momentum losses, but small amounts of star formation in the warp itself form a low-metallicity thick disc. We show that observations of resolved stellar populations in warped galaxies in the local universe could provide evidence for the presence of these processes and therefore indirectly reveal ongoing gas accretion and the existence of hot gas halos.},

	Abstract = {Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques are now widely used for cosmological parameter estimation. Chains are generated to sample the posterior probability distribution obtained following the Bayesian approach. An important issue is how to optimize the efficiency of such sampling and how to diagnose whether a finite-length chain has adequately sampled the underlying posterior probability distribution. We show how the power spectrum of a single such finite chain may be used as a convergence diagnostic by means of a fitting function, and discuss strategies for optimizing the distribution for the proposed steps. The methods developed are applied to current cosmic microwave background and large-scale structure data interpreted using both a pure adiabatic cosmological model and a mixed adiabatic/isocurvature cosmological model including possible correlations between modes. For the latter application, because of the increased dimensionality and the presence of degeneracies, the need for tuning MCMC methods for maximum efficiency becomes particularly acute.},

	Abstract = {Popular models for describing the luminosity-density profiles of dynamically hot stellar systems (e.g. Jaffe, Hernquist, Dehnen) were constructed with the desire to match the deprojected form of an R1/4 light profile. Real galaxies, however, are now known to have a range of different light-profile shapes that scale with mass. Consequently, although highly useful, the above models have implicit limitations, and this is illustrated here through their application to a number of real galaxy density profiles. On the other hand, the analytical density profile given by Prugniel & Simien closely matches the deprojected form of S{\'e}rsic R1/n light profiles - including deprojected exponential light profiles. It is thus applicable for describing bulges in spiral galaxies, dwarf elliptical galaxies, and both ordinary and giant elliptical galaxies. Moreover, the observed S{\'e}rsic quantities define the parameters of the density model. Here we provide simple equations, in terms of elementary and special functions, for the gravitational potential and force associated with this density profile. Furthermore, to match galaxies with partially depleted cores, and better explore the supermassive black hole/galaxy connection, we have added a power-law core to this density profile and derived similar expressions for the potential and force of this hybrid profile. Expressions for the mass and velocity dispersion, assuming isotropy, are also given. These spherical models may also prove appropriate for describing the dark matter distribution in haloes formed from LambdaCDM cosmological simulations.},

	Abstract = {It is generally better to think of galaxies as made of orbits rather than stars. Orbits in most axisymmetric potentials form a three-dimensional continuum. The natural coordinates for the description of this continuum are action integrals. Thus, one is led to the view that the Galaxy inhabits a three-dimensional Euclidean space called action space. In this space the density of stars belonging to each galactic component is given by the distribution function of that component. The structure and evolution of the disk within action space is described. The most natural disk distribution function turns out to violate the classical relation between Oort's constants and the ratio of principal velocity dispersions of disk stars. The Schwarzschild velocity ellipsoid is not a self-similar solution of the equation that governs the diffusion of disk stars through action space if scattering of stars by molecular clouds is the sole cause of the diffusion. A general procedure for choosing the distribution functions of hot components such as the classical populations II is described and illustrated by several worked examples.},

	Abstract = {We study the population of satellite galaxies formed in a suite of N-body/gasdynamical simulations of galaxy formation in a Lambda cold dark matter universe. The simulations resolve nearly 10 most luminous satellites around each host, and probe systems up to six or seven magnitudes fainter than the primary. We find little spatial or kinematic bias between the dark matter and the satellite population. The radius containing half of all satellites is comparable to the half-mass radius of the dark matter component, and the velocity dispersion of the satellites is a good indicator of the virial velocity of the halo; sigmasat/Vvir ~ 0.9 +/- 0.2. Applied to the Local Group, this result suggests that the virial velocity of the Milky Way and M31 might be substantially lower than the rotation speed of their disc components; we find VMWvir ~ 109 +/- 22 km s-1 and VM31vir ~138 +/- 35 km s-1, respectively, compared to VMWrot ~ 220 km s-1 and VM31rot ~ 260 km s-1.Although the uncertainties are large, it is intriguing that both estimates are significantly lower than expected from some semi-analytic models, which predict a smaller difference between Vvir and Vrot. The detailed kinematics of simulated satellites and dark matter are also in good agreement: both components show a steadily decreasing velocity dispersion profile and a mild radial anisotropy in their velocity distribution. By contrast, the stellar halo of the simulated galaxies, which consists predominantly of stellar debris from disrupted satellites, is kinematically and spatially distinct from the population of surviving satellites. This is because the survival of a satellite as a self-bound entity depends sensitively on mass and on time of accretion and surviving satellites are significantly biased toward low-mass systems that have been recently accreted by the galaxy. Our results support recent proposals for the origin of the systematic differences between stars in the Galactic halo and in Galactic satellites: the elusive `building blocks' of the Milky Way stellar halo were on average more massive, and were accreted (and disrupted) earlier than the population of dwarfs that has survived self-bound until thepresent.},

	Abstract = {A simple cosmological model with only six parameters (matter density, Omegamh2, baryon density, Omegabh2, Hubble constant, H0, amplitude of fluctuations, sigma8, optical depth, tau, and a slope for the scalar perturbation spectrum, ns) fits not only the 3 year WMAP temperature and polarization data, but also small-scale CMB data, light element abundances, large-scale structure observations, and the supernova luminosity/distance relationship. Using WMAP data only, the best-fit values for cosmological parameters for the power-law flat Lambda cold dark matter (LambdaCDM) model are (Omegamh2,Omegabh2,h,ns,tau,sigma8)=(0.1277+0.0080-0.0079,0.02229+/-0.00073,0.732+0.031-0.032,0.958+/-0.016,0.089+/-0.030,0.761+0.049-0.048). The 3 year data dramatically shrink the allowed volume in this six-dimensional parameter space. Assuming that the primordial fluctuations are adiabatic with a power-law spectrum, the WMAP data alone require dark matter and favor a spectral index that is significantly less than the Harrison-Zel'dovich-Peebles scale-invariant spectrum (ns=1, r=0). Adding additional data sets improves the constraints on these components and the spectral slope. For power-law models, WMAP data alone puts an improved upper limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, r0.002<0.65 (95% CL) and the combination of WMAP and the lensing-normalized SDSS galaxy survey implies r0.002<0.30 (95% CL). Models that suppress large-scale power through a running spectral index or a large-scale cutoff in the power spectrum are a better fit to the WMAP and small-scale CMB data than the power-law LambdaCDM model; however, the improvement in the fit to the WMAP data is only Deltachi2=3 for 1 extra degree of freedom. Models with a running-spectral index are consistent with a higher amplitude of gravity waves. In a flat universe, the combination of WMAP and the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) data yields a significant constraint on the equation of state of the dark energy, w=-0.967+0.073-0.072. If we assume w=-1, then the deviations from the critical density, OmegaK, are small: the combination of WMAP and the SNLS data implies Omegak=-0.011+/-0.012. The combination of WMAP 3 year data plus the HST Key Project constraint on H0 implies Omegak=-0.014+/-0.017 and OmegaLambda=0.716+/-0.055. Even if we do not include the prior that the universe is flat, by combining WMAP, large-scale structure, and supernova data, we can still put a strong constraint on the dark energy equation of state, w=-1.08+/-0.12. For a flat universe, the combination of WMAP and other astronomical data yield a constraint on the sum of the neutrino masses, Sigmamnu<0.66 eV (95%CL). Consistent with the predictions of simple inflationary theories, we detect no significant deviations from Gaussianity in the CMB maps using Minkowski functionals, the bispectrum, trispectrum, and a new statistic designed to detect large-scale anisotropies in the fluctuations.},

	Abstract = {Parametrizing their light distribution with a Sersic profile, we show that the non-homology in the structure of early-type galaxies has a measurable incidence on their scaling relations. Indeed, the Sersic exponent (i.e., the shape of the photometric profile) correlates with the residuals to the Fundamental Plane. This correlation is in excellent agreement with the theoretical expectation for isotropic galaxies. Adding together the contributions of: (i) the stellar population, (ii) the rotational support, and (iii) the non-homology, fully accounts for the tilt of the Fundamental Plane. This supports the hypothesis of a constant stellar to dynamical mass ratio in the luminous region of early-type galaxies. We confirm the existence of relations between the Sersic exponent, n, and the effective radius or the absolute magnitude, and we give indications for a saturation of this index for the bright (M_B_<-20) or large (r_e_>6.3kpc) galaxies at a value compatible with the de Vaucouleurs law (n=4).},

The properties of the M31 cluster system are very similar to those of the Galactic system. No dependence of metallicity on cluster luminosity is found. The number distribution as a function of metallicity is consistent with that of Galactic clusters. There is evidence for a weak metallicity gradient as a function of projected radius.

	Abstract = {We present evidence for a metal-poor, [Fe/H]~-1.4, sigma=0.2 dex, stellar halo component detectable at radii from 10 to 70 kpc, in our nearest giant spiral neighbor, the Andromeda galaxy. This metal-poor sample underlies the recently discovered extended rotating component and has no detected metallicity gradient. This discovery uses a large sample of 9861 radial velocities of red giant branch (RGB) stars obtained with the Keck II Telescope and DEIMOS spectrograph, with 827 stars with robust radial velocity measurements isolated kinematically to lie in the halo component primarily by windowing out the extended rotating component, which dominates the photometric profile of Andromeda out to <50 kpc (deprojected). The stars lie in 54 spectroscopic fields spread over an 8 deg2 region, and are expected to fairly sample the halo to a radius of ~70 kpc. The halo sample shows no significant evidence for rotation. Fitting a simple model in which the velocity dispersion of the component decreases with radius, we find a central velocity dispersion of 152 km s-1 decreasing by -0.90 km s-1 kpc-1. By fitting a cosmologically motivated NFW halo model to the halo stars we constrain the virial mass of M31 to be greater than 9.0×1011 Msolar with 99% confidence. The properties of this halo component are very similar to that found in our Milky Way, revealing that these roughly equal mass galaxies may have led similar accretion and evolutionary paths in the early universe.},

	Abstract = {We present a spectroscopic survey of the giant stellar stream found in the halo of the Andromeda galaxy. Taken with the DEIMOS multi-object spectrograph on the Keck2 telescope, these data display a narrow velocity dispersion of 11 +/- 3 km s-1, with a steady radial velocity gradient of 245 km s-1 over the 125-kpc radial extent of the stream studied so far. This implies that the Andromeda galaxy possesses a substantial dark matter halo. We fit the orbit of the stream in different galaxy potential models. In a simple model with a composite bulge, disc and halo, where the halo follows a universal profile that is compressed by the formation of the baryonic components, we find that the kinematics of the stream require a total mass inside 125 kpc of M125= 7.5+2.5-1.3× 1011 Msolar, or M125 > 5.4 × 1011 Msolar at the 99 per cent confidence level. This is the first galaxy in which it has been possible to measure the halo mass distribution by such direct dynamical means over such a large distance range. The resulting orbit shows that if M32 or NGC 205 is connected with the stream, they must either trail or lag the densest region of the stream by more than 100 kpc. Furthermore, according to the best-fitting orbit, the stream passes very close to M31, causing its demise as a coherent structure and producing a fan of stars that will pollute the inner halo, thereby confusing efforts to measure the properties of genuine halo populations. Our data show that several recently identified planetary nebulae, which have been proposed as evidence for the existence of a new companion of M31, are likely members of the Andromeda stream.},

	Abstract = {(Abridged) We use N-body simulations to study the effects that a divergent (i.e. "cuspy") dark matter (DM) profile introduces on the tidal evolution of dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs). Our models assume cosmologically-motivated initial conditions where dSphs are DM-dominated systems on eccentric orbits about a host galaxy composed of a dark halo and a baryonic disc. We find that the resilience of dSphs to tidal stripping is extremely sensitive to the halo cuspiness; whereas dwarfs with a cored profile can be easily destroyed by the host disc, those with cusps always retain a bound remnant. For a given halo profile the evolution of the structural parameters as driven by tides is controlled solely by the total amount of mass lost. This information is used to construct a semi-analytic code that simulates the hierarchical build-up of spiral galaxies assuming different halo profiles and disc masses. We find that tidal encounters with discs tend to decrease the average mass of satellites at all galactocentric radii. Interestingly, satellites accreted before re-ionization (z>6), which may be singled out by anomalous metallicity patterns, survive only if haloes are cuspy. We show that the size-mass relation established from Milky Way (MW) dwarfs strongly supports the presence of cusps in the majority of these systems, as cored models systematically underestimate the masses of the known Ultra-Faint dSphs. Our models also indicate that a massive M31 disc may explain why many of its dSphs fall below the size-mass relationship derived from MW dSphs. We use our models to constrain the mass threshold below which star formation is suppressed in DM haloes, finding that luminous satellites must be accreted with masses above 10^8--10^9 M_sol in order to explain the size-mass relation observed in MW dwarfs.},

	Abstract = {The mass of the Galactic dark matter halo is under vivid discussion. A recent study by Xue et al. (2008, ApJ, 684, 1143) revised the Galactic halo mass downward by a factor of ~2 relative to previous work, based on the line-of-sight velocity distribution of ~2400 blue horizontal-branch (BHB) halo stars. The observations were interpreted in a statistical approach using cosmological galaxy formation simulations, as only four of the 6D phase-space coordinates were determined. Here we concentrate on a close investigation of the stars with highest negative radial velocity from that sample. For one star, SDSSJ153935.67+023909.8 (J1539+0239 for short), we succeed in measuring a significant proper motion, i.e. full phase-space information is obtained. We confirm the star to be a Population II BHB star from an independent quantitative analysis of the SDSS spectrum - providing the first NLTE study of any halo BHB star - and reconstruct its 3D trajectory in the Galactic potential. J1539+0239 turns out as the fastest halo star known to date, with a Galactic rest-frame velocity of 694$^{+300}_{-221}$ km/s (full uncertainty range from Monte Carlo error propagation) at its current position. The extreme kinematics of the star allows a significant lower limit to be put on the halo mass in order to keep it bound, of M_halo$\ge1.7_{-1.1}^{+2.3}\times10^{12}$ Msun. We conclude that the Xue et al. results tend to underestimate the true halo mass as their most likely mass value is consistent with our analysis only at a level of 4%. However, our result confirms other studies that make use of the full phase-space information.},

	Abstract = {We use a sample of newly-discovered globular clusters from the Pan-Andromeda Archaeological Survey (PAndAS) in combination with previously-catalogued objects to map the spatial distribution of globular clusters in the M31 halo. At projected radii beyond ~30 kpc, where large coherent stellar streams are readily distinguished in the field, there is a striking correlation between these features and the positions of the globular clusters. Adopting a simple Monte Carlo approach, we test the significance of this association by computing the probability that it could be due to the chance alignment of globular clusters smoothly distributed in the M31 halo. We find the likelihood of this possibility is low, below 1%, and conclude that the observed spatial coincidence between globular clusters and multiple tidal debris streams in the outer halo of M31 reflects a genuine physical association. Our results imply that the majority of the remote globular cluster system of M31 has been assembled as a consequence of the accretion of cluster-bearing satellite galaxies. This constitutes the most direct evidence to date that the outer halo globular cluster populations in some galaxies are largely accreted.},

@article{Martin:2009,
	Abstract = {We present the discovery of two new dwarf galaxies, Andromeda XXI and Andromeda XXII, located in the surroundings of the Andromeda and Triangulum galaxies (M31 and M33). These discoveries stem from the first year data of the Pan-Andromeda Archaeological Survey, a photometric survey of the M31/M33 group conducted with the Megaprime/MegaCam Wide-Field Camera mounted on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. Both satellites appear as spatial overdensities of stars which, when plotted in a color-magnitude diagram, follow metal-poor, [Fe/H] = -1.8, red giant branches at the distance of M31/M33. Andromeda XXI is a moderately bright dwarf galaxy (MV = -9.9 $\pm$ 0.6), albeit with low surface brightness, emphasizing again that many relatively luminous M31 satellites still remain to be discovered. It is also a large satellite, with a half-light radius close to 1 kpc, making it the fourth largest Local Group dwarf spheroidal galaxy after the recently discovered Andromeda XIX, Andromeda II, and Sagittarius around the Milky Way, and supports the trend that M31 satellites are larger than their Milky Way counterparts. Andromeda XXII is much fainter (MV = -6.5 $\pm$ 0.8) and lies a lot closer in projection to M33 than it does to M31 (42 versus 224 kpc), suggesting that it could be the first Triangulum satellite to be discovered. Although this is a very exciting possibility in the context of a past interaction of M33 with M31 and the fate of its satellite system, a confirmation will have to await a good distance estimate to confirm its physical proximity to M33. Along with the dwarf galaxies found in previous surveys of the M31 surroundings, these two new satellites bring the number of dwarf spheroidal galaxies in this region to 20.  Based on observations obtained with MegaPrime/MegaCam, a joint project of CFHT and CEA/DAPNIA, at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) which is operated by the National Research Council (NRC) of Canada, the Institute National des Sciences de l'Univers of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique of France, and the University of Hawaii.},

	Abstract = {The hypothesis that M31 and the Galaxy have almost equal and opposite momenta when seen from the barycenter of the Local Group puts a severe constraint on the component of the sun's motions towards M31. Using this constraint and eliminating distant satellites of Andromeda from the solution, the motion of the sun, as seen from the barycenter, is in galactic coordinates 280 km/sec towards l = 102 deg, b = -5 deg. Using recent more accurate determinations of the sun's motion around the Galaxy which are discussed, the motion of the Galaxy is found to lie 27 + or - 15 deg from the direction of M31 and the total relative velocity of these galaxies is deduced to be 137 + or - 20 km/sec. Better bounds are deduced for the mass of the Local Group.},

The lack of binaries in advanced stages of orbital history may imply that isolated binary galaxies merge rapidly; if the timing argument is indiscriminately applied to all of the binaries (bound and unbound), the timing masses correlate poorly with the measured masses. In light of this analysis, the radial orbit timing mass of the M31 galaxy system is of the order of 50 percent of the two-sphere mass, if the system is bound.},

	Abstract = {We use the Jaffe model as a global mass distribution for the Galaxy and determine the circular velocity upsiloc and the Jaffe radius rj using the satellites of the Galaxy, estimates of the local escape velocity of stars, the constraints imposed by the known rotation curve of the disk, and the Local Group timing model. The models include the systematic uncertainties in the isotropy of the satellite orbits, the form of the stellar distribution function near the escape velocity, and the ellipticity of the M31/Galaxy orbit. If we include the Local Group timing constraint, then Leo I is bound, upsiloc = 220$\pm$30km s-1, and rj = 200 kpc (115 kpc ≲ rj ≲ 360 kpc) at 90% confidence. The satellite orbits are nearly isotropic with beta = 1 -sigma2/theta/sigma2r = 0.2 (-0.5 ≲ beta ≲ 0.6), and the stellar distribution function near the escape velocity is f(ε) ∝ εk with kr = 4.4 (1.6 ≲ kr ≲ 8.5), where kr = k + 5/2. While not an accurate measurement of k, it is consistent with models of violent relaxation (k = 3/2). The mass inside 50 kpc is (4.9$\pm$1.1) × 1011 Msun.  Higher mass models require that M31 is on its second orbit and that the halo is larger than the classical tidal limit of the Galaxy/M31 binary system. Such models must have a significant fraction of the Local Group mass in an extended Local Group halo. Lower mass models require that both M31 and Leo I are unbound, but there is no plausible mechanism to produce observed deviations of M31 and Leo I from their expected velocities in an unbound system. If we do not use the Local Group timing model, the median mass of the Galaxy increases significantly, and the error bars broaden. Using only the satellite, escape velocity, and disk rotation curve constraints, the median mass interior to 50 kpc is 3.9 (5.1), and the 90% confidence interval is 3.2-5.5 (4.0-6.4) without (with) Leo I in units of 1011 Msun. The lower bound without Leo I is 65% of the mass expected for a continuation of a flat rotation curve.},

It is shown that, in all cases, whenever a published result is given with asymmetric uncertainties, the value of the physical quantity of interest is biased with respect to what would be obtained using at best all experimental and theoretical information that contribute to evaluate the combined uncertainty. The probabilistic solution to the problem is provided both in exact and in approximated forms.},

In particular, the CART, the C4.5, the Random Forest and fuzzy logic algorithms are studied and reliable classifiers are developed to distinguish between spiral galaxies, elliptical galaxies or star/unknown galactic objects. Morphology information for the training and testing datasets is obtained from the Galaxy Zoo project while the corresponding photometric and spectra parameters are downloaded from the SDSS DR7 catalogue.},

	Abstract = {Radial velocities of H-alpha emission regions were measured at 1636 points in the arms of Galaxy M31. A Fabry-Perot interference method was used. The lack of significant differences in radial velocity along the nuclear and minor axes indicates that expansion motions are not present. Several features of the rotation curve suggest systematic motions, however: the dispersion of the velocities about the curve is more important than the mean of the observational errors, and previously undetected ridges appear in crossing the N3 and N4 arms of Baade. Results of mass distribution calculations are given.},

	Abstract = {We present an updated analysis of the M31 pixel lensing candidate event OAB-N2 previously reported in Calchi Novati et al. (2009). Here we take advantage of new data both astrometric and photometric. Astrometry: using archival 4m-KPNO and HST/WFPC2 data we perform a detailed analysis on the event source whose result, although not fully conclusive on the source magnitude determination, is confirmed by the following light curve photometry analysis. Photometry: first, unpublished WeCAPP data allows us to confirm OAB-N2, previously reported only as a viable candidate, as a well constrained pixel lensing event. Second, this photometry enables a detailed analysis in the event parameter space including the effects due to finite source size. The combined results of these analyses allow us to put a strong lower limit on the lens proper motion. This outcome favors the MACHO lensing hypothesis over self lensing for this individual event and points the way toward distinguishing between the MACHO and self-lensing hypotheses from larger data sets.},

	Abstract = {Using the Torus radiative transfer code we produce synthetic observations of the 21 cm neutral hydrogen line from an SPH simulation of a spiral galaxy. The SPH representation of the galaxy is mapped onto an AMR grid, and a ray tracing method is used to calculate 21 cm line emission for lines of sight through the AMR grid in different velocity channels and spatial pixels. The result is a synthetic spectral cube which can be directly compared to real observations. We compare our synthetic spectral cubes to observations of M31 and M33 and find good agreement, whereby increasing velocity channels trace the main disc of the galaxy. The synthetic data also show kinks in the velocity across the spiral arms, evidence of non-circular velocities. These are still present even when we blur our data to a similar resolution as the observations, but largely absent in M31 and M33, indicating those galaxies do not contain significant spiral shocks. Thus the detailed velocity structure of our maps better represent previous observations of the grand design spiral M81.},

@article{Chemin:2009,
	Abstract = {We present a new deep 21 cm survey of the Andromeda galaxy, based on high-resolution observations performed with the Synthesis Telescope and the 26 m antenna at the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory. The H I distribution and kinematics of the disk are analyzed and basic dynamical properties are given. The rotation curve is measured out to 38 kpc, showing a nuclear peak at 340 km s-1, a dip at 202 km s-1 around 4 kpc, two distinct flat parts at 264 km s-1 and 230 km s-1, and an increase to 275 km s-1 in the outermost regions. Except for the innermost regions, the axisymmetry of the gas rotation is very good. A very strong warp of the H I disk is evidenced. The central regions appear less inclined than the average disk inclination of 74$\,^{\circ}$, while the outer regions appear more inclined. Mass distribution models by LambdaCDM Navarro-Frenk-White, Einasto or pseudo-isothermal dark matter halos with baryonic components are presented. They fail to reproduce the exact shape of the rotation curve. No significant differences are measured between the various shapes of halo. The dynamical mass of M31 enclosed within a radius of 38 kpc is (4.7 $\pm$ 0.5) × 1011 {\cal M} sun. The dark matter component is almost four times more massive than the baryonic mass inside this radius. A total mass of 1.0 × 1012 {\cal M} sun is derived inside the virial radius. The spectral structure of the observations is very complex, with sometimes up to five H I components detected per spectrum, which is very rarely seen in other galaxies. New H I structures are discovered in the datacube. The most remarkable new features are an external arm and thin H I spurs in the disk outskirts. A relationship between these spurs and outer stellar clumps is evidenced. The external arm is 32 kpc long, lies on the far side of the galaxy, and has no obvious counterpart on the other side of the galaxy. Its kinematics clearly differs from the outer adjacent disk. Both these H I perturbations could result from tidal interactions with galaxy companions like NGC 205.  Observations obtained at the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory (DRAO), operated as a national facility by the National Research Council of Canada.},

@article{Lee:2008,
	Abstract = {We present a kinematic analysis of the globular cluster (GC) system in M31, using the velocity data for 504 GCs including those for 150 GCs in our wide-field survey. The all GC system shows strong rotation, with rotation amplitude of vrot~190 km s-1, and weak rotation persists even for the outermost samples at |Y|>=5 kpc, where Y represents the projected distance from the major axis. The rotation-corrected velocity dispersion for the GC system is estimated to be sigmap,r~130 km s-1, and it increases from sigmap,r~120 km s-1 at |Y|<1 kpc to sigmap,r~150 km s-1 at |Y|>=5 kpc. These results are very similar to those for the metal-poor GCs. This shows that there is a dynamically hot halo in M31 that is rotating but primarily pressure-supported. We have identified 50 ``friendless'' GCs, and they appear to rotate around the major axis of M31. Both metal-rich GCs and metal-poor GCs show strong rotation in the inner region. The rotation for the faint GCs is stronger than that for the bright GCs. We have identified 56 GCs and GC candidates with X-ray detection including 39 GCs with measured velocities. The majority of X-ray-emitting GCs follow the disk rotation. We have derived a rotation curve of M31 using the GCs at |Y|<=0.6 kpc. We have estimated the dynamical mass of M31 using ``Projected Mass Estimator (PME)'' and ``Tracer Mass Estimator (TME)'' as MPME=5.5+0.4-0.3×1011 Msolar out to a radius of ~55 kpc and MTME=19.2+1.4-1.3×1011 Msolar for a radius of ~100 kpc, respectively. We finally discuss the implication of these results and compare the kinematics of GCs with that of planetary nebulae in M31.

	Abstract = {We use a highly homogeneous set of data from 132 early-type galaxies in the Virgo and Fornax clusters in order to study the properties of the globular cluster luminosity function (GCLF). The globular cluster system of each galaxy was studied using a maximum likelihood approach to model the intrinsic GCLF after accounting for contamination and completeness effects. The results presented here update our Virgo measurements and confirm our previous results showing a tight correlation between the dispersion of the GCLF and the absolute magnitude of the parent galaxy. Regarding the use of the GCLF as a standard candle, we have found that the relative distance modulus between the Virgo and Fornax clusters is systematically lower than the one derived by other distance estimators, and in particular it is 0.22mag lower than the value derived from surface brightness fluctuation measurements performed on the same data. From numerical simulations aimed at reproducing the observed dispersion of the value of the turnover magnitude in each galaxy cluster we estimate an intrinsic dispersion on this parameter of 0.21mag and 0.15mag for Virgo and Fornax respectively. All in all, our study shows that the GCLF properties vary systematically with galaxy mass showing no evidence for a dichotomy between giant and dwarf early-type galaxies. These properties may be influenced by the cluster environment as suggested by cosmological simulations.},

	Abstract = {The narrow GD-1 stream of stars, spanning 60$\,^{\circ}$ on the sky at a distance of ~10 kpc from the Sun and ~15 kpc from the Galactic center, is presumed to be debris from a tidally disrupted star cluster that traces out a test-particle orbit in the Milky Way halo. We combine Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) photometry, USNO-B astrometry, and SDSS and Calar Alto spectroscopy to construct a complete, empirical six-dimensional (6D) phase-space map of the stream. We find that an eccentric orbit in a flattened isothermal potential describes this phase-space map well. Even after marginalizing over the stream orbital parameters and the distance from the Sun to the Galactic center, the orbital fit to GD-1 places strong constraints on the circular velocity at the Sun's radius Vc = 224 $\pm$ 13 km s-1 and total potential flattening q Phi = 0.87+0.07 -0.04. When we drop any informative priors on Vc , the GD-1 constraint becomes Vc = 221 $\pm$ 18 km s-1. Our 6D map of GD-1, therefore, yields the best current constraint on Vc and the only strong constraint on q Phi at Galactocentric radii near R ~ 15 kpc. Much, if not all, of the total potential flattening may be attributed to the mass in the stellar disk, so the GD-1 constraints on the flattening of the halo itself are weak: q Phi,halo > 0.89 at 90% confidence. The greatest uncertainty in the 6D map and the orbital analysis stems from the photometric distances, which will be obviated by GAIA.  Based on observations collected at the Centro Astron{\'o}mico Hispano Alem{\'a}n (CAHA) at Calar Alto, operated jointly by the Max-Planck Institut f{\"u}r Astronomie and the Instituto de Astrof{\'\i}sica de Andaluc{\'\i}a (CSIC).},

	Abstract = {We present a three-dimensional reconstruction of the velocity distribution of nearby stars (lsim100 pc) using a maximum likelihood density estimation technique applied to the two-dimensional tangential velocities of stars. The underlying distribution is modeled as a mixture of Gaussian components. The algorithm reconstructs the error-deconvolved distribution function, even when the individual stars have unique error and missing-data properties. We apply this technique to the tangential velocity measurements from a kinematically unbiased sample of 11,865 main-sequence stars observed by the Hipparcos satellite. We explore various methods for validating the complexity of the resulting velocity distribution function, including criteria based on Bayesian model selection and how accurately our reconstruction predicts the radial velocities of a sample of stars from the Geneva-Copenhagen Survey (GCS). Using this very conservative external validation test based on the GCS, we find that there is little evidence for structure in the distribution function beyond the moving groups established prior to the Hipparcos mission. This is in sharp contrast with internal tests performed here and in previous analyses, which point consistently to maximal structure in the velocity distribution. We quantify the information content of the radial velocity measurements and find that the mean amount of new information gained from a radial velocity measurement of a single star is significant. This argues for complementary radial velocity surveys to upcoming astrometric surveys.},

@article{Hogg:2005,
	Abstract = {An algorithm is developed to model the three-dimensional velocity distribution function of a sample of stars using only measurements of each star's two-dimensional tangential velocity. The algorithm works with ``missing data'': it reconstructs the three-dimensional distribution from data (velocity measurements) that all have one dimension that is unmeasured (the radial direction). It also accounts for covariant measurement uncertainties on the tangential velocity components. The algorithm is applied to tangential velocities measured in a kinematically unbiased sample of 11,865 stars taken from the Hipparcos catalog, chosen to lie on the main sequence and have well-measured parallaxes. The local stellar velocity distribution function of each of a set of 20 color-selected subsamples is modeled as a mixture of two three-dimensional Gaussian ellipsoids of arbitrary relative responsibility. In the fitting, one Gaussian (the ``halo'') is fixed at the known mean velocity and velocity variance tensor of the Galaxy halo, and the other (the ``disk'') is allowed to take an arbitrary mean and an arbitrary variance tensor. The mean and variance tensors (commonly known as the ``velocity ellipsoid'') of the disk velocity distribution are both found to be strong functions of stellar color, with long-lived populations showing larger velocity dispersion, slower mean rotation velocity, and smaller vertex deviation than short-lived populations. The local standard of rest (LSR) is inferred in the usual way, and the Sun's motion relative to the LSR is found to be (U,V,W)solar=(10.1,4.0,6.7)+/-(0.5,0.8,0.2) km s-1. Artificial data sets are made and analyzed, with the same error properties as the Hipparcos data, to demonstrate that the analysis is unbiased. The results are shown to be insensitive to the assumption that the velocity distributions are Gaussian.},

	Abstract = {We present new Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopic observations of hundreds of individual stars along the sightline to the first three of the Andromeda (M31) dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies to be discovered, And I, II, and III, and combine them with recent spectroscopic studies by our team of three additional M31 dSphs, And VII, X, and XIV, as a part of the SPLASH Survey (Spectroscopic and Photometric Landscape of Andromeda's Stellar Halo). Member stars of each dSph are isolated from foreground Milky Way dwarf stars and M31 field contamination using a variety of photometric and spectroscopic diagnostics. Our final spectroscopic sample of member stars in each dSph, for which we measure accurate radial velocities with a median uncertainty (random plus systematic errors) of 4-5 km s-1, includes 80 red giants in And I, 95 in And II, 43 in And III, 18 in And VII, 22 in And X, and 38 in And XIV. The sample of confirmed members in the six dSphs is used to derive each system's mean radial velocity, intrinsic central velocity dispersion, mean abundance, abundance spread, and dynamical mass. This combined data set presents us with a unique opportunity to perform the first systematic comparison of the global properties (e.g., metallicities, sizes, and dark matter masses) of one-third of Andromeda's total known dSph population with Milky Way counterparts of the same luminosity. Our overall comparisons indicate that the family of dSphs in these two hosts have both similarities and differences. For example, we find that the luminosity-metallicity relation is very similar between L ~ 105 and 107 L sun, suggesting that the chemical evolution histories of each group of dSphs are similar. The lowest luminosity M31 dSphs appear to deviate from the relation, possibly suggesting tidal stripping. Previous observations have noted that the sizes of M31's brightest dSphs are systematically larger than Milky Way satellites of similar luminosity. At lower luminosities between L = 104 and 106 L sun, we find that the sizes of dSphs in the two hosts significantly overlap and that four of the faintest M31 dSphs are smaller than Milky Way counterparts. The first dynamical mass measurements of six M31 dSphs over a large range in luminosity indicate similar mass-to-light ratios compared to Milky Way dSphs among the brighter satellites, and smaller mass-to-light ratios among the fainter satellites. Combined with their similar or larger sizes at these luminosities, these results hint that the M31 dSphs are systematically less dense than Milky Way dSphs. The implications of these similarities and differences for general understanding of galaxy formation and evolution are summarized.},

	Abstract = {We present the McMaster Unbiased Galaxy Simulations (MUGS), the first 9 galaxies of an unbiased selection ranging in total mass from 5$\times10^{11}$ M$_\odot$ to 2$\times10^{12}$ M$_\odot$ simulated using n-body smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) at high resolution. The simulations include a treatment of low temperature metal cooling, UV background radiation, star formation, and physically motivated stellar feedback. Mock images of the simulations show that the simulations lie within the observed range of relations such as that between color and magnitude and that between brightness and circular velocity (Tully-Fisher). The greatest discrepancy between the simulated galaxies and observed galaxies is the high concentration of material at the center of the galaxies as represented by the centrally peaked rotation curves and the high bulge-to-total ratios of the simulations determined both kinematically and photometrically. This central concentration represents the excess of low angular momentum material that long has plagued morphological studies of simulated galaxies and suggests that higher resolutions and a more accurate description of feedback will be required to simulate more realistic galaxies. Even with the excess central mass concentrations, the simulations suggest the important role merger history and halo spin play in the formation of disks.},

Among others, we outline the Metropolis algorithm and give an overview of existing algorithms for the generation of the phase space of final state particles in high energy collisions.},

	Abstract = {The absolute bolometric luminosity of the point of core helium ignition in old, metal-poor, red giant stars is of roughly constant magnitude, varying only very slightly with mass or metallicity It can thus be used as a standard candle. Here, we review the main difficulties in measuring this location in any real data set and we develop an empirical approach to optimize it for tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) analysis. We go on to present a new algorithm for the identification of the TRGB in nearby metal-poor stellar systems. Our method uses a least-squares fit of a data adaptive slope to the luminosity function in 1-mag windows. This finds the region of the luminosity function that shows the most significant decline in star counts as we go to brighter magnitudes; the base of this decline is attributed as the location of the tip. This technique then allows for the determination of realistic uncertainties which reflect the quality of the luminosity function used, but which are typically ~0.02 mag rms +~0.03 mag systematic, a significant improvement upon previous methods that have used the tip as a standard candle. Finally, we apply our technique to the Local Group spiral galaxy M33 and the dwarf galaxies Andromeda I and II, and derive distance modulii of 24.50 +/- 0.06 mag (794 +/- 23 kpc), 24.33 +/- 0.07 mag (735 +/- 23 kpc) and 24.05 +/- 0.06 mag (645 +/- 19 kpc) respectively. The result for M33 is in excellent agreement with the Cepheid distances to this galaxy, and makes the possibility of a significant amount of reddening in this object unlikely.},

	Abstract = {We present spectroscopic observations of the And XII dwarf spheroidal galaxy using DEIMOS/Keck II, showing it to be moving rapidly through the Local Group (-556 km s-1 heliocentric velocity, -281 km s-1 relative to Andromeda), falling into the Local Group from ~115 kpc beyond Andromeda's nucleus. And XII therefore represents a dwarf galaxy plausibly falling into the Local Group for the first time and never having experienced a dense galactic environment. From Green Bank Telescope observations, a limit on the H I gas mass of <3×103 Msolar suggests that And XII's gas could have been removed prior to experiencing the tides of the Local Group galaxies. Orbit models suggest that the dwarf is close to the escape velocity of M31 for published mass models. And XII is our best direct evidence for the late infall of satellite galaxies, a prediction of cosmological simulations.},

	Abstract = {We present the results of a spectroscopic survey of the recently discovered faint Milky Way satellites Bo{\"o}tes, Ursa Major I, Ursa Major II and Willman 1 (Wil1). Using the DEep Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph mounted on the Keck II telescope, we have obtained samples that contain from ~15 to ~85 probable members of these satellites for which we derive radial velocities precise to a few kms-1 down to i ~ 21-22. About half of these stars are observed with a high enough signal-to-noise ratio to estimate their metallicity to within +/-0.2 dex. The characteristics of all the observed stars are made available, along with those of the Canes Venatici I dwarf galaxy that have been analysed in a companion paper.  From this data set, we show that Ursa Major II is the only object that does not show a clear radial velocity peak. However, the measured systemic radial velocity (vr = 115 +/- 5kms-1) is in good agreement with simulations in which this object is the progenitor of the recently discovered Orphan Stream. The three other satellites show velocity dispersions that make them highly dark matter dominated systems (under the usual assumptions of symmetry and virial equilibrium). In particular, we show that despite its small size and faintness, the Wil1 object is not a globular cluster given its metallicity scatter over -2.0 <~ [Fe/H] <~ -1.0 and is therefore almost certainly a dwarf galaxy or dwarf galaxy remnant. We measure a radial velocity dispersion of only 4.3+2.3-1.3kms-1 around a systemic velocity of -12.3 +/- 2.3kms-1 which implies a mass-to-light ratio of ~700 and a total mass of ~5 × 105Msolar for this satellite, making it the least massive satellite galaxy known to date. Such a low mass could mean that the 107Msolar limit that had until now never been crossed for Milky Way and Andromeda satellite galaxies may only be an observational limit and that fainter, less massive systems exist within the Local Group. However, more modelling and an extended search for potential extratidal stars are required to rule out the possibility that these systems have not been significantly heated by tidal interaction.  The data presented herein were obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation.  E-mail: martin@mpia-hd.mpg.de ‡  Canadian Space Agency Fellow.},

@article{Dehnen:1998,
	Abstract = {From the parallaxes and proper motions of a kinematically unbiased subsample of the Hipparcos Catalogue, we have re-determined as a function of colour the kinematics of main-sequence stars. Whereas the radial and vertical components of the mean heliocentric velocity of stars show no trend with colour, the component in the direction of Galactic rotation nicely follows the asymmetric drift relation, except for stars bluer than B-V=0.1mag. Extrapolating to zero dispersion yields, for the velocity of the Sun with respect to the local standard of rest (LSR) in kms^-1, U_0=10.00+/-0.36 (radially inwards), V_0=5.25+/-0.62 (in the direction of Galactic rotation) and W_0=7.17+/-0.38 (vertically upwards). Parenago's discontinuity is beautifully visible in a plot of velocity dispersion against colour: the dispersion, which is essentially constant for late spectral types, decreases towards early spectral types blueward of B-V~0.61mag. We determine the velocity dispersion tensor sigma^2 as function of colour. The mixed moments involving vertical motion are zero within the errors, while sigma^2_xy is non-zero at about (10kms^-1)^2 independently of colour. The resulting vertex deviations are about 20 deg for early-type stars and 10 deg+/-4 deg for old-disc stars. The persistence of the vertex deviation to late-type stars implies that the Galactic potential is significantly non-axisymmetric at the solar radius. If spiral arms are responsible for the non-axisymmetry, they cannot be tightly wound. Except for stars bluer than B-V=0.1mag, the ratios of the principal velocity dispersions are given by sigma_1:sigma_2:sigma_3~2.2:1.4:1, while the absolute values increase with colour from sigma_1~20kms^-1 at B-V=0.2mag to sigma_1~38kms^-1 at Parenago's discontinuity and beyond. These ratios imply significant heating of the disc by spiral structure and that R_0/R_d~=3 to 3.5, where R_d is the scalelength of the disc.},

Using follow-up imaging data we have estimated its distance and other physical properties. We find that Andromeda X has a dereddened central surface brightness of muV,0~26.7 mag arcsec-2 and a total apparent magnitude of Vtot~16.1, which at the derived distance modulus, (m-M)0~24.12-24.34, yields an absolute magnitude of MV~-8.1+/-0.5 these values are quite comparable to those of Andromeda IX, a previously discovered low-luminosity M31 satellite. The discoveries of Andromeda X and of numerous other extremely faint satellites around M31 and the Milky Way in the past few years suggest that such objects may be plentiful in the Local Group.},

	Abstract = {We present the first spectroscopic analysis of the faint M31 satellite galaxies, AndXI and AndXIII, and a reanalysis of existing spectroscopic data for two further faint companions, And IX and AndXII. By combining data obtained using the DEIMOS spectrograph mounted on the Keck II telescope with deep photometry from the Suprime-Cam instrument on Subaru, we have calculated global properties for the dwarfs, such as systemic velocities, metallicites and half-light radii.We find each dwarf to be very metal poor ([Fe/H] -2 both photometrically and spectroscopically, from their stacked spectrum), and as such, they continue to follow the luminosity-metallicity relationship established with brighter dwarfs. We are unable to resolve a dispersion for And XI due to small sample size and low S/N, but we set a one sigma upper limit of sigma-v <5 km/s. For And IX, And XII and And XIII we resolve velocity dispersions of v=4.5 (+3.4,-3.2), 2.6(+5.1,-2.6) and 9.7(+8.9,-4.5) km/s, and derive masses within the half light radii of 6.2(+5.3,-5.1)x10^6 Msun, 2.4 (+6.5,-2.4)x10^6 Msun and 1.1(+1.4,-0.7)x10^7 Msun respectively. We discuss each satellite in the context of the Mateo relations for dwarf spheroidal galaxies, and the Universal halo profiles established for Milky Way dwarfs (Walker et al. 2009). For both galaxies, this sees them fall below the Universal halo profiles of Walker et al. (2009). When combined with the findings of McConnachie & Irwin (2006a), which reveal that the M31 satellites are twice as extended (in terms of both half-light and tidal radii) as their Milky Way counterparts, these results suggest that the satellite population of the Andromeda system could inhabit halos that are significantly different from those of the Milky Way in terms of their central densities (abridged).},

@article{Martin:2006,
	Abstract = {We present the discovery of three faint dwarf galaxies and a globular cluster in the halo of the Andromeda galaxy (M31), found in our MegaCam survey that spans the southern quadrant of M31, from a projected distance of ~50 to ~150kpc. Though the survey covers 57 deg2, the four satellites lie within 2$\,^{\circ}$ of one another. From the tip of the red giant branch (RGB), we estimate that the globular cluster lies at a distance of 631 +/- 58kpc from the Milky Way and along with a ~100kpc projected distance from M31 we derive a total distance of 175 +/- 55kpc from its host, making it the farthest M31 globular cluster known. It also shows the typical characteristics of a bright globular cluster, with a half-light radius of 2.3 +/- 0.2pc and an absolute magnitude in the V band of MV,0 = -8.5 +/- 0.3. Isochrone fitting reveals that it is dominated by a very old population with a metallicity of [Fe/H] ~ -1.3. The three dwarf galaxies are revealed as overdensities of stars that are aligned along the RGB tracks in their colour-magnitude diagrams. These satellites are all very faint, with absolute magnitudes in the range -7.3 <~ MV,0 <~ -6.4, and show strikingly similar characteristics with metallicities of [Fe/H] ~ -1.4 and half-light radii of ~120 +/- 45pc, making these dwarf galaxies two to three times smaller than the smallest previously known satellites of M31. Given their faintness, their distance is difficult to constrain, but we estimate them to be between 740 and 955kpc which places them well within the virial radius of the host galaxy. The panoramic view of the MegaCam survey can provide an unbiased view of the satellite distribution of the Andromeda galaxy and, extrapolating from its coverage of the halo, we estimate that up to 45 +/- 20 satellites brighter than MV ~ -6.5 should be orbiting M31. Hence faint dwarf galaxies cannot alone account for the missing satellites that are predicted by Lambda cold dark matter models, unless they reside in dark matter minihaloes that are more massive than the typical masses of 107Msolar currently inferred from their central radial velocity dispersion.

	Abstract = {We present a deep photometric survey of the Andromeda galaxy, conducted with the wide-field cameras of CFHT and INT, that covers the inner 50 kpc of the galaxy and the southern quadrant out to ~150 kpc and includes an extension to M33 at >200 kpc. This is the first systematic panoramic study of this very outermost region of galaxies. We detect a multitude of large-scale structures of low surface brightness, including several streams, and two new relatively luminous (MV~-9) dwarf galaxies: And XV and And XVI. Significant variations in stellar populations due to intervening stream-like structures are detected in the inner halo, which is particularly important in shedding light on the mixed and sometimes conflicting results reported in previous studies. Underlying the many substructures lies a faint, smooth, and extremely extended halo component, reaching out to 150 kpc, whose stellar populations are predominantly metal-poor. We find that the smooth halo component in M31 has a radially decreasing profile that can be fitted with a Hernquist model of immense scale radius ~55 kpc, almost 4 times larger than theoretical predictions. Alternatively a power law with SigmaV~R-1.91+/-0.11 can be fitted to the projected profile, similar to the density profile in the Milky Way. If it is symmetric, the total luminosity of this structure is ~109 Lsolar, again similar to the stellar halo of the Milky Way. This vast, smooth, underlying halo is reminiscent of a classical ``monolithic'' model and completely unexpected from modern galaxy formation models. M33 is also found to have an extended metal-poor halo component, which can be fitted with a Hernquist model also of scale radius ~55 kpc. These extended slowly decreasing halos will provide a challenge and strong constraints for further modeling.

In this review, I update the census of Local Group dwarfs based on the most recent distance and radial velocity determinations. I then discuss the detailed properties of this sample, including (a) the integrated photometric parameters and optical structures of these galaxies, (b) the content, nature, and distribution of their interstellar medium (ISM), (c) their heavy-element abundances derived from both stars and nebulae, (d) the complex and varied star-formation histories of these dwarfs, (e) their internal kinematics, stressing the relevance of these galaxies to the "dark matter problem" and to alternative interpretations, and (f) evidence for past, ongoing, and future interactions of these dwarfs with other galaxies in the Local Group and beyond. To complement the discussion and to serve as a foundation for future work, I present an extensive set of basic observational data in tables that summarize much of what we know and still do not know about these nearby dwarfs. Our understanding of these galaxies has grown impressively in the past decade, but fundamental puzzles remain that will keep the Local Group at the forefront of galaxy evolution studies for some time.},

	Abstract = {We present an all-sky catalog of 451 nearby galaxies, each having an individual distance estimate D<~10 Mpc or a radial velocity VLG<550 km s-1. The catalog contains data on basic optical and H I properties of the galaxies, in particular, their diameters, absolute magnitudes, morphological types, circumnuclear region types, optical and H I surface brightnesses, rotational velocities, and indicative mass-to-luminosity and H I mass-to-luminosity ratios, as well as a so-called tidal index, which quantifies the galaxy environment. We expect the catalog completeness to be roughly 70%-80% within 8 Mpc. About 85% of the Local Volume population are dwarf (dIr, dIm, and dSph) galaxies with MB>-17.0, which contribute about 4% to the local luminosity density, and roughly 10%-15% to the local H I mass density. The H I mass-to-luminosity and the H I mass-to-total (indicative) mass ratios increase systematically from giant galaxies toward dwarfs, reaching maximum values about 5 in solar units for the most tiny objects. For the Local Volume disklike galaxies, their H I masses and angular momentum follow Zasov's linear relation, expected for rotating gaseous disks being near the threshold of gravitational instability, favorable for active star formation. We found that the mean local luminosity density exceeds 1.7-2.0 times the global density, in spite of the presence of the Tully void and the absence of rich clusters in the Local Volume. The mean local H I density is 1.4 times its ``global'' value derived from the H I Parkes Sky Survey. However, the mean local baryon density Omegab(<8Mpc)=2.3% consists of only a half of the global baryon density, Omegab=(4.7+/-0.6)% (Spergel et al., published in 2003). The mean-square pairwise difference of radial velocities is about 100 km s-1 for spatial separations within 1 Mpc, increasing to ~300 km s-1 on a scale of ~3 Mpc. also We calculated the integral area of the sky occupied by the neighboring galaxies. Assuming the H I size of spiral and irregular galaxies to be 2.5 times their standard optical diameter and ignoring any evolution effect, we obtain the expected number of the line-of-sight intersections with the H I galaxy images to be dn/dz~0.4, which does not contradict the observed number of absorptions in QSO spectra.},

@article{Courteau:1999,
	Abstract = {New data on the membership of the Local Group (LG) are used, in conjunction with new and improved radial velocity data, to refine the derivation of the motion of the Sun relative to the LG. The Sun is found to be moving with a velocity of V=306+/-18 km s^-1 toward an apex at l=99 deg+/-5 deg and b=-4 deg+/-4 deg. This finding agrees very well with previous analyses, but we discuss the possibility of a bias if the phase-space distribution of LG galaxies is bimodal. The LG radial velocity dispersion is 61+/-8 km s^-1. We use various mass estimators to compute the mass of the LG and the Andromeda subgroup. We find M_LG=(2.3+/-0.6)x10^12 M_solar, from which M/L_V=44+/-12 (in solar units). For an assumed LG age of 14+/-2 Gyr, the radius of an idealized LG zero-velocity surface is r_0=1.18+/-0.15 Mpc. The LG is found to have 35 likely members. Only three of these have (uncertain) distances >~1.0 Mpc from the LG barycenter. Barring new discoveries of low surface brightness dwarfs, this suggests that the LG is more compact and more isolated from its surroundings than previously believed.},

The HiRes experiment consists of two detectors that observe cosmic ray showers via the fluorescence light they emit. HiRes data can be analyzed in monocular mode, where each detector is treated separately, or in stereoscopic mode where they are considered together. Using the monocular mode the HiRes collaboration measured the cosmic ray spectrum and made the first observation of the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin cutoff. In this paper we present the cosmic ray spectrum measured by the stereoscopic technique. Good agreement is found with the monocular spectrum in all details.},

The origin of this feature remains unknown. A small workshop to review some modern experimental measurements of this region was held at the Adler Planetarium in Chicago, USA in June 2000. This paper summarizes the results presented at this workshop and the discussion of their interpretation in the context of hadronic models of atmospheric air showers.},

	Abstract = {This biennial Review summarizes much of particle physics. Using data from previous editions, plus 2778 new measurements from 645 papers, we list, evaluate, and average measured properties of gauge bosons, leptons, quarks, mesons, and baryons. We also summarize searches for hypothetical particles such as Higgs bosons, heavy neutrinos, and supersymmetric particles. All the particle properties and search limits are listed in Summary Tables. We also give numerous tables, figures, formulae, and reviews of topics such as the Standard Model, particle detectors, probability, and statistics. Among the 108 reviews are many that are new or heavily revised including those on CKM quark-mixing matrix, Vud &Vus, Vcb &Vub, top quark, muon anomalous magnetic moment, extra dimensions, particle detectors, cosmic background radiation, dark matter, cosmological parameters, and big bang cosmology. A booklet is available containing the Summary Tables and abbreviated versions of some of the other sections of this full Review. All tables, listings, and reviews (and errata) are also available on the Particle Data Group website: http://pdg.lbl.gov.},

@article{Tavio:2008,
	Abstract = {We present an approximation for the average density profile of dark matter haloes in the LambdaCDM cosmological model, which is accurate to within 10--15% even for large radial distances from 0.05R_{vir} up to 10R_{vir} for halo masses ranging from 10^{11.5} to 10^{15.0} h^{-1}M_{Sun}. We propose a modified form of the Navarro, Frenk & White (NFW) approximation: \rho(r)=\rho_{NFW}(r)+ A (r/R_{vir})^{-1}+B (1+r/R_{vir})^{-1}. This generalized expression, which is applicable to the external regions of dark matter haloes, only very slightly affects the density in the inner regions of haloes. The strong correlation among the different parameters in the model allows us to describe the profile in terms of just one parameter: the virial mass. We integrate our density profile to derive the enclosed mass in a sphere of a given radius and compare it with the NFW results. We find that the NFW underestimates the enclosed mass by more than 50% at 10R_{vir}, whereas our model reproduces the results from numerical simulations to within 2% accuracy even at this distance. We also use this new approximation to study the weak gravitational lensing and to obtain an analytic expression for the tangential shear. This allows us to quantify the contribution to the shear from the outer regions of the density profile. For the first time we calculate the difference between the tangential shear calculated via the NFW profile and the corresponding result when the external regions of haloes in cosmological simulations are taken into account. We find a 4% difference for all the mass ranges under study.},

	Abstract = {We carried out a numerical calculation for the propagation of ultra-high energy cosmic ray nucleons in the inergalactic space by a Monte-Carlo method. The resulting energy spectrum above 1018 eV is modified by the interaction of nucleons with the micro wave background (MWB) photons, forming a bump and a cutoff, with position depending on the propagation distance and source distribution. It is found that the treatment of the evolution of the universe and the interactions between cosmic rays and MWB photons is crucial. We also calculated the spectra of neutrinos and gamma rays produced by the interaction of nucleons with MWB photons. The flux of these particles strongly depends on propagation distance, cosmological evolution parameter and the maximum energy of the cosmic rays. The possibility to detect the secondary neutrinos is also discussed.},

	Abstract = {Data collected by the Pierre Auger Observatory provide evidence for anisotropy in the arrival directions of the cosmic rays with the highest-energies, which are correlated with the positions of relatively nearby active galactic nuclei (AGN) [Pierre Auger Collaboration, Science 318 (2007) 938]. The correlation has maximum significance for cosmic rays with energy greater than ˜6 × 1019 eV and AGN at a distance less than ˜75 Mpc. We have confirmed the anisotropy at a confidence level of more than 99% through a test with parameters specified a priori, using an independent data set. The observed correlation is compatible with the hypothesis that cosmic rays with the highest-energies originate from extra-galactic sources close enough so that their flux is not significantly attenuated by interaction with the cosmic background radiation (the Greisen Zatsepin Kuz'min effect). The angular scale of the correlation observed is a few degrees, which suggests a predominantly light composition unless the magnetic fields are very weak outside the thin disk of our galaxy. Our present data do not identify AGN as the sources of cosmic rays unambiguously, and other candidate sources which are distributed as nearby AGN are not ruled out. We discuss the prospect of unequivocal identification of individual sources of the highest-energy cosmic rays within a few years of continued operation of the Pierre Auger Observatory.},

The measurements are based entirely on flash-analog-to-digital conversion of phototube signals, digitized continuously at 10MHz, and stored in a deep (820mus) pipeline, for deadtimeless readout following a parallel pipeline trigger. The massive parallel processing by digital signal processors and programmable logic devices is distributed site-wide, with 42 telescopes and a central facility linked by optical fiber. The system was designed and built at Columbia University, Nevis Laboratories.},

@article{Swordy:2001,
	Abstract = {The existing paradigm of the origin of Galactic cosmic rays places strong supernovae shocks as the acceleration site for this material. However, although the EGRET gamma-ray telescope has reported evidence for GeV gamma rays from some supernovae, it is still unclear if the signal is produced by locally intense cosmic rays. Although non-thermal X-ray emissions have been detected from supernova remnants and interpreted as synchrotron emission from locally intense electrons at energies up to ~100 TeV, the inferred source energy spectral slopes seem much steeper than the electron source spectrum observed through direct measurements. It remains the case that simple energetics provide the most convincing argument that supernovae power the bulk of cosmic rays. Two characteristics which can be used to investigate this issue at high energy are the source energy spectra and the source composition derived from direct measurements.},

	Abstract = {The presence of photons in the cosmic rays of highest energy (above 1020eV) would be a strong indication of a ``top-down'' production mechanism, e.g. the decay of topological defects. The Pierre Auger Observatory is aimed to detect cosmic rays in this energy range with a large statistics. The pair production in the magnetic field of the Earth, followed by hard synchrotron radiation, generates early cascades containing mainly photons with energies below the LPM threshold (a few 1019 eV) while unconverted photons above this energy produce in the atmosphere slowly developing showers. We describe some observables related to the fluorescence profile and to the ground signals (lateral distribution and front curvature), which can provide a clear signature of abnormally delayed showers, even if they represent a small fraction of the flux. Moreover, the magnetic conversion exhibit a characteristic anisotropy with respect to the local direction of the field, allowing an unambiguous confirmation of photons, against the hypothesis of weakly interacting objects.},

	Abstract = {There has been much interest in possible violations of Lorentz invariance, particularly motivated by quantum gravity theories. It has been suggested that a small amount of Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) could turn off photomeson interactions of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) with photons of the cosmic background radiation and thereby eliminate the resulting sharp steepening in the spectrum of the highest energy CRs predicted by Greisen Zatsepin and Kuzmin (GZK). Recent measurements of the UHECR spectrum reported by the HiRes and Auger collaborations, however, indicate the presence of the GZK effect. We present the results of a detailed calculation of the modification of the UHECR spectrum caused by LIV using the formalism of Coleman and Glashow. We then compare these results with the experimental UHECR data from Auger and HiRes. Based on these data, we find a best-fit amount of LIV of 4.5-4.5+1.5×10, consistent with an upper limit of 6×10. This possible amount of LIV can lead to a recovery of the cosmic ray spectrum at higher energies than presently observed. Such an LIV recovery effect can be tested observationally using future detectors.},

	Abstract = {The discoveries of the GZK cutoff with the HiRes and Auger Observatories and the discovery by Auger of clustering of >~60 EeV ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) towards nearby <~75 Mpc) AGNs along the supergalactic plane establishes the astrophysical origin of the UHECRs. The likely sources of the UHECRs are gamma-ray bursts and radio-loud AGNs because: (1) they are extragalactic; (2) they are sufficiently powerful; (3) acceleration to ultra-high energies can be achieved in their relativistic ejecta; (4) anomalous X-ray and $\gamma$-ray features can be explained by nonthermal hadron acceleration in relativistic blast waves; and (5) sources reside within the GZK radius. Two arguments for acceleration to UHE are presented, and limits on UHECR ion acceleration are set. UHECR ions are shown to be able to survive without photodisintegrating while passing through the AGN scattered radiation field, even if launched deep in the broad line region. UHECR injection throughout cosmic time fits the measured energy spectrum of UHECRs, at least for protons. Local UHECR proton and ion interaction and energy-loss mean free paths are calculated using an empirical fit to the extragalactic background light (EBL) at IR and optical energies. Minimum intergalactic magnetic (IGM) fields ~1e-11 G are derived from clustering assuming specific source origins, e.g., Cen A, nearby AGNs, or GRBs for the super-GZK CRs seen with Auger. Besides distinct cosmic-ray induced gamma-ray signatures that should be observed with the Gamma ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST), source and GZK neutrino detections and the arrival distribution of UHECR in direction and time can finally decide the sources of cosmic rays at the highest energies.},

In spite of the limited acceptance the data which have been gathered have already delivered interesting results on High Energy Cosmic Rays.

HiRes' measurement of the flux of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays shows a sharp suppression at an energy of 6×1019eV, consistent with the expected cutoff energy. We observe the ankle of the cosmic-ray energy spectrum as well, at an energy of 4×1018eV. We describe the experiment, data collection, and analysis and estimate the systematic uncertainties.

	Abstract = {In this paper, we develop an algorithm allowing to calculate line-of-sight velocity dispersions in an axisymmetric galaxy outside the galactic plane. When constructing a self-consistent model, we take into account the galactic surface brightness distribution, stellar rotation curve and velocity dispersions. We assume that the velocity dispersion ellipsoid is triaxial and lies under a certain angle with respect to the galactic plane. This algorithm is applied to an Sa galaxy NGC 4594 = M 104, for which there exist velocity dispersion measurements outside the galactic major-axis. The mass-distribution model is constructed in two stages. In the first stage, we construct a luminosity-distribution model, where only galactic surface brightness distribution is taken into account. Here, we assume the galaxy to consist of the nucleus, the bulge, the disc and the stellar metal-poor halo and determine structural parameters of these components. Thereafter, in the second stage, we develop, based on the Jeans equations, a detailed mass-distribution model and calculate line-of-sight velocity dispersions and the stellar rotation curve. Here, a dark matter (DM) halo is added to visible components. Calculated dispersions are compared with observations along different slit positions perpendicular and parallel to the galactic major-axis. In the best-fitting model, velocity dispersion ellipsoids are radially elongated with sigmatheta/sigmaR ~= 0.9-0.4,sigmaz/sigmaR ~= 0.7-0.4, and lie under the angles less than or equal to 30$\,^{\circ}$ with respect to the galactic equatorial plane. Outside the galactic plane, velocity dispersion behaviour is more sensitive to the DM density distribution and allows to estimate dark halo parameters. For visible matter, the total M/LB = 4.5 +/- 1.2, M/LR = 3.1 +/- 0.7. The central density of the DM halo is rhoDM(0) = 0.033Msolarpc-3.},

	Abstract = {The presence of a massive black hole has been invoked to match the observed rotation velocities and velocity dispersions at the centres of M31, M32, NGC 3115 and NGC 4594, Here we determine stellar line-of-sight velocity profiles of these galaxies, from high spatial resolution, high S/N spectra centred on the G-band, the Mg b triplet and the Ca II IR triplet. For all spectra we determine rotation velocities, V, velocity dispersions, sigma, and deviations of the velocity profiles from a Gaussian shape, as quantified by the Gauss-Hermite moments h_3_,...,h_6_. Significant deviations of the velocity profiles from a Gaussian are present in all objects. The strongest deviations are asymmetries quantified by h_3_ and are found primarily along the major axis. The amplitude of h_3_ is typically |h_3_| <~ 0.15 and is correlated with V/sigma. Its sign always indicates an excess of stars at low rotation velocities, and results in the mean stellar streaming velocity being lower than the mean of the best-fitting Gaussian, the quantity conventionally used to characterize rotation. The difference is ~10 per cent for M31, M32 and NGC 3115, and ~20 per cent for NGC 4594. It is thus important that models take the observed velocity profile shapes into account. We demonstrate that the observed deviations from Gaussian velocity profiles are for the most part not the result of projection and seeing convolution. We calculate the velocity profiles predicted by Tonry's model for M32, taking seeing and projection into account, but assuming the local (unprojected) velocity distributions to be Gaussian. The predicted velocity profiles are nearly Gaussian, in conflict with our data. Self-consistent dynamical models must thus be constructed to fit the observed velocity profiles. Such models should constrain the central structure quite strongly, and will hence provide improved constraints on the mass and presence of a supermassive central object.},

	Abstract = {Simple analytical models, such as the Hernquist model, are very useful tools to investigate the dynamical structure of galaxies. Unfortunately, most of the analytical distribution functions are either isotropic or of the Osipkov-Merritt type, and hence basically one-dimensional. We present three different families of anisotropic distribution functions that self-consistently generate the Hernquist potential-density pair. These families have constant, increasing and decreasing anisotropy profiles respectively, and can hence represent a wide variety of orbital structures. For all of the models presented, the distribution function and the velocity dispersions can be written in terms of elementary functions. These models are ideal tools for a wide range of applications, in particular to generate the initial conditions for N-body or Monte Carlo simulations.},

	Abstract = {The analytical phase-space distribution function (DF) of spherical self-consistent galaxy (or cluster) models, embedded in a dark matter halo, where both density distributions follow the Hernquist profile, with different total masses and core radii (hereafter "HH models"), is presented. The concentration and the amount of the stellar and dark matter distributions are described by four parameters: the mass and core radius of the reference component and two dimensionless parameters that describe the mass and core radius of the halo component A variable amount of orbital anisotropy is allowed in both components, following the widely used Osipkov-Merritt parameterization. An important case is obtained for a null core radius of the halo, corresponding to the presence of a central black hole (BH).  Before giving the explicit form for the DF, the necessary and sufficient conditions that the model parameters must satisfy in order to correspond to a consistent system (i.e., a system for which each physically distinct component has a positive DF) are analytically derived. In this context, it is proved that globally isotropic HH models are consistent for any mass ratio and core radii ratio, even in the case of a central BH. In this last case, the analytical expression for a lower limit of the anisotropy radius of the host system as a function of the BH mass is given. These results are then compared with those obtained by direct inspection of the DF. In the particular case of global isotropy, the stability of HH models is proved, and the explicit formula for the differential energy distribution is derived. Finally, the stability of radially anisotropic HH models is briefly discussed.   The expression derived for the DF is useful for understanding the relations between anisotropy, density shape, and external potential well in a consistent stellar system and to produce initial conditions for N-body simulations of two-component galaxies or galaxy clusters.},

These techniques are well-known amongst experts, but the current literature lacks a formal description.

	Abstract = {Fluctuations in the temperature of the cosmic microwave background have now been detected over a wide range of angular scales, and a consistent picture seems to be emerging. This article describes some of the implications for cosmology. Analysis of all of the published detections suggests the existence of a peak on degree scales with a height 2.4 to 10 (90 percent confidence level) times the amplitude of the power spectrum at large angular scales. This result confirms an early prediction, implies that the universe did in fact recombine, and limits theories of structure formation. Illustrative examples show how comparison of the microwave background data and the large-scale structure data will be a potentially powerful means of answering fundamental questions about the universe.},

	Abstract = {Detailed calculations of the temperature fluctuations in the cosmic background radiation for universes dominated by massive collisionless relics of the big bang are presented. An initially adiabatic constant curvature perturbation spectrum is assumed. In models with cold dark matter, the simplest hypothesis - that galaxies follow the mass distribution leads to small-scale anisotropies which exceed current observational limits if omega is less than 0.2 h to the -4/3. Since low values of omega are indicated by dynamical studies of galaxy clustering, cold particle models in which light traces mass are probably incorrect. Reheating of the pregalactic medium is unlikely to modify this conclusion. In cold particle or neutrino-dominated universes with omega = 1, presented predictions for small-scale and quadrupole anisotropies are below current limits. In all cases, the small-scale fluctuations are predicted to be about 10 percent linearly polarized.},

	Abstract = {We present a simplified treatment for calculating the cosmic microwave background anisotropy power spectrum in adiabatic models. It consists of solving for the evolution of a two-fluid model until the epoch of recombination and then integrating over the sources to obtain the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy power spectrum. The approximation is useful both for a physical understanding of CMB anisotropies as well as for a quantitative analysis of cosmological models. Comparison with exact calculations shows that the accuracy is typically 10%-20% over a large range of angles and cosmological models, including those with curvature and cosmological constant. Using this approximation we investigate the dependence of the CMB anisotropy on the cosmological parameters. We identify six dimensionless parameters that uniquely determine the anisotropy power spectrum within our approximation. CMB experiments on different angular scales could in principle provide information on all these parameters. In particular, mapping of the Doppler peaks would allow an independent determination of baryon mass density, matter mass density, and the Hubble constant.},

	Abstract = {Computations of the radiation correlation functions and angular power spectra are presented for microwave-background anisotropies expected in Omega = 1 cold-dark-matter-dominated universes with scale-invariant adiabatic or isocurvature initial conditions. The results are valid on all angular scales. The statistical properties of the radiation pattern are described, and the theory of two-dimensional Gaussian random fields is developed. A large number of properties of such fields may be derived analytically or semianalytically, such as the number densities of hot and cold spots, the eccentricities of peaks, and peak correlation properties. The formulas presented here provide valuable insight into the textural characteristics of the microwave-background anisotropies and must be satisfied if the primordial fluctuations are Gaussian. The assumption of Gaussian initial conditions makes it possible to make highly specific predictions for the pattern of the temperature anisotropies. This is demonstrated by the construction of maps of the fluctuations predicted for the total intensity and the polarization.},

The formalism is an extension to the polarized case of the analytic approach recently developed by Hu and Sugiyama to evaluate the (unpolarized) temperature correlation function. The analytic approach helps to highlight the dependence of potentially measurable polarization properties of the cosmic microwave background radiation upon various parameters of the cosmological model. We show, for instance, that the ratio between the multipoles of the temperature and polarization correlation functions depends very sensitively upon the value of Omega0, the matter density in units of the critical, in an open universe.},

	Abstract = {We examine the orbits of satellite galaxies identified in a suite of N-body/gasdynamical simulations of the formation of L* galaxies in a Lambda cold dark matter universe. The numerical resolution of the simulations allows us to track in detail the orbits of the ~ 10 brightest satellites around each primary. Most satellites follow conventional orbits; after turning around, they accrete into their host halo and settle on orbits whose apocentric radii are steadily eroded by dynamical friction. As a result, satellites associated with the primary are typically found within its virial radius, rvir, and have velocities consistent with a Gaussian distribution with mild radial anisotropy. However, a number of outliers are also present. We find that a surprising number (about one-third) of satellites identified at z = 0 are on unorthodox orbits, with apocentres that exceed their turnaround radii. These include a number of objects with extreme velocities and apocentric radii at times exceeding ~3.5rvir (or, e.g. >~1 Mpc when scaled to the Milky Way). This population of satellites on extreme orbits consists typically of the faint member of a satellite pair whose kinship is severed by the tidal field of the primary during first approach. Under the right circumstances, the heavier member of the pair remains bound to the primary, whilst the lighter companion is ejected on to a highly energetic orbit. Since the concurrent accretion of multiple satellite systems is a defining feature of hierarchical models of galaxy formation, a fairly robust prediction of this scenario is that at least some of these extreme objects should be present in the Local Group. We speculate that this three-body ejection mechanism may be the origin of (i) some of the newly discovered high-speed satellites around M31 (such as Andromeda XIV); (ii) some of the distant fast-receding Local Group members, such as Leo I and (iii) the oddly isolated dwarf spheroidals Cetus and Tucana in the outskirts of the Local Group. Our results suggest that care must be exercised when using the orbits of the most weakly bound satellites to place constraints on the total mass of the Local Group.},

From this starting point, the reader is introduced to perturbations about an FRW universe: their evolution with the Einstein-Boltzmann equations, their generation by primordial inflation, and their observational consequences. These consequences include the anisotropy spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) featuring acoustic peaks and polarization, the matter power spectrum with baryonic wiggles, and their detection via photometric galaxy surveys, redshift distortions, cluster abundances, and Modern Cosmology is the first book to explain in detail the structure of the acoustic peaks in the CMB, the E/B decomposition in polarization which may allow for detection of primordial gravity waves, and the modern analysis techniques used on increasingly large cosmological data sets. Readers will gain the tools needed to work in cosmology and learn how modern observations are rapidly revolutionizing our picture of the universe.},

	Abstract = {Working toward a model-independent understanding of cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies and their significance, we undertake a comprehensive and self-contained study of scalar perturbation theory. Initial conditions, evolution, thermal history, matter content, background dynamics, and geometry all play a role in determining the anisotropy. By employing analytic techniques to illuminate the numerical results, we are able to separate and identify each contribution. We thus bring out the nature of the total Sachs-Wolfe effect, acoustic oscillations, diffusion damping, Doppler shifts, and reionization, as well as their particular manifestation in a crittical, curvature, or cosmological constant dominated universe. By studying the full angular and spatial content of the resultant fluctuations, we isolate the signature of these effects from the dependence on initial conditions. Whereas structure in the Sachs-Wolfe anisotropy depends strongly on the underlying power spectra, the acoustic oscillations provide features which are nearly model independent. This may allow for future determination of the matter content of the Universe as well as the adiabatic and/or isocurvature nature of the initial fluctuations.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a systematic treatment of the linear theory of scalar gravitational perturbations in the synchronous gauge and the conformal Newtonian (or longitudinal) gauge. It differs from others in the literature in that we give, in both gauges, a complete discussion of all particle species that are relevant to any flat cold dark matter (CDM), hot dark matter (HDM), or CDM + HDM models (including a possible cosmological constant). The particles considered include CDM, baryons, photons, massless neutrinos, and massive neutrinos (an HDM candidate), where the CDM and baryons are treated as fluids while a detailed phase-space description is given to the photons and neutrinos.  Particular care is applied to the massive neutrino component, which has been either ignored or approximated crudely in previous works.  Isentropic initial conditions on superhorizon scales are derived. The coupled, linearized Boltzmann, Einstein, and fluid equations that govern the evolution of the metric and density perturbations are then solved numerically in both gauges for the standard CDM model and two CDM + HDM models with neutrino mass densities Omeganu = 0.2 and 0.3, assuming a scale-invariant, adiabatic spectrum of primordial fluctuations. We also give the full details of the cosmic microwave background anisotropy, and present the first accurate calculations of the angular power spectra in the two CDM + HDM models including photon polarization, higher neutrino multipole moments, and helium recombination. The numerical programs for both gauges are available at http://arcturus.mit.edu/cosmics.},

@article{Saglia:2010,
	Abstract = {We present new optical long-slit data along six position angles of the bulge region of M 31. We derive accurate stellar and gas kinematics reaching 5 arcmin from the center, where the disk light contribution is always less than 30%, and out to 8 arcmin along the major axis, where the disk provides 55% of the total light. We show that the velocity dispersions of McElroy (1983) are severely underestimated (by up to 50 km s-1). As a consequence, previous dynamical models have underestimated the stellar mass of M 31's bulge by a factor of 2. As a further consequence, the light-weighted velocity dispersion of the galaxy grows to 166 km s-1 and to 170 km s-1 if rotation is also taken into account, thus reducing the discrepancy between the predicted and measured mass of the black hole at the center of M 31 from a factor of 3 to a factor of 2. The kinematic position angle varies with distance, pointing to triaxiality, but a quantitative conclusion can be reached only after simultaneous proper dynamical modeling of the bulge and disk components is performed. We detect gas counterrotation near the bulge minor axis. We measure eight emission-corrected Lick indices. They are approximately constant on circles. Using simple stellar population models we derive the age, metallicity and alpha-element overabundance profiles. Except for the region in the inner arcsecs of the galaxy, the bulge of M 31 is uniformly old (>= 12 Gyr, with many best-fit ages at the model grid limit of 15 Gyr), slightly alpha-elements overabundant ([alpha/Fe] ≈ 0.2) and of solar metallicity, in agreement with studies of the resolved stellar components. The predicted u-g, g-r and r-i Sloan color profiles match the dust-corrected observations reasonably well, within the known limitations of current simple stellar population models. The stellar populations have approximately radially constant mass-to-light ratios (M/LR ≈ 4-4.5 M_o/L_o for a Kroupa IMF), which is in agreement with the stellar dynamical estimates based on our new velocity dispersions. In the inner arcsecs the luminosity-weighted age drops to 4-8 Gyr, while the metallicity increases to above three times the solar value. Starting from 6 arcmin from the center along the major axis, the mean age drops to <=8 Gyr with slight supersolar metallicity (≈ +0.1 dex) and alpha-element overabundance (≈ +0.2 dex) for a mass-to-light ratio M/LR <= 3 M_o/L_o. Diagnostic diagrams based on the [OIII]/Hbeta and [NI]/Hbeta emission line equivalent widths (EWs) ratios indicate that the gas is ionized by shocks outside 10 arcsec, but an AGN-like ionizing source could be present near the center. We speculate that a gas-rich minor merger happened some 100 Myr ago, causing the observed minor axis gas counterrotation, the recent star formation event and possibly some nuclear activity.

	Abstract = {This is the fourth paper in a series in which we attempt to put constraints on the flattening of dark halos in disk galaxies. We observed for this purpose the HI in edge-on galaxies, where it is in principle possible to measure the force field in the halo vertically and radially from gas layer flaring and rotation curve decomposition respectively. We have analysed the HI channel maps to accurately measure all four functions that describe the HI kinematics and 3D distribution: the radial HI surface density, the HI vertical thickness, the rotation curve and the HI velocity dispersion. In this paper we analyse these data for the edge-on galaxy UGC7321. We measured the stellar mass distribution ($M=3\times10^8$ \msun with $M/L_R\lesim0.2$), finding that the vertical force of the gas disk dominates the stellar disk at all radii. We find that the vertical force puts a much stronger constraint on the stellar mass-to-light ratio than rotation curve decomposition. Fitting of the vertical force field derived from the flaring and velocity dispersion of the HI revealed that UGC7321 has a spherical halo density distribution with a flattening of $q = c/a = 1.0 \pm 0.1$.},

	Abstract = {New radial velocity measurements for previously known and newly confirmed globular clusters (GCs) in the nearby massive galaxy NGC 5128 are presented. We have obtained spectroscopy from LDSS-2/Magellan, VIMOS/VLT, and Hydra/CTIO from which we have measured the radial velocities of 218 known, and identified 155 new, GCs. The current sample of confirmed GCs in NGC 5128 is now 605 with 564 of these having radial velocity measurements. We have performed a new kinematic analysis of the GC system that extends out to 45 arcmin in galactocentric radius. We have examined the systemic velocity, projected rotation amplitude and axis, and the projected velocity dispersion of the GCs as functions of galactocentric distance and metallicity. Our results indicate that the metal-poor GCs have a very mild rotation signature of (26 pm 15) km/s. The metal-rich GCs are rotating with a higher, though still small signature of (43 pm 15) km/s around the isophotal major axis of NGC 5128 within 15 arcmin. Their velocity dispersions are consistent within the uncertainties and the profiles appear flat or declining within 20 arcmin. We note the small sample of metal-rich GCs with ages less than 5 Gyr in the literature appear to have different kinematic properties than the old, metal-rich GC subpopulation. The mass and mass-to-light ratios have also been estimated using the GCs as tracer particles for NGC 5128. Out to a distance of 20 arcmin, we have obtained a mass of (5.9 pm 2.0) x 10^(11) M_(sun) and a mass-to-light ratio in the B-band of 16 M_(sun)/L_(B,sun). Combined with previous work on the ages and metallicities of its GCs, as well as properties of its stellar halo, our findings suggest NGC 5128 formed via hierarchical merging over other methods of formation, such as major merging at late times.},

	Abstract = {We present an efficient method of computing cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies in nonflat universes. First, we derive the Boltzmann equation for CMB temperature and polarization fluctuations produced by scalar perturbations in a general Robertson-Walker universe. We then apply the integral method in order to solve this equation, writing temperature and polarization anisotropies as a time integral over a geometrical term and a source term. The geometrical terms can be written using ultra-spherical Bessel functions, which depend on curvature. These cannot be precomputed, as for flat space. Instead, we solve their differential equation directly for selected values of the multipoles. The resulting computational time is comparable to the flat-space case, improving over previous methods by 2-3 orders of magnitude. This allows one to compute highly accurate CMB temperature and polarization spectra, matter transfer functions, and their CMB normalizations for any cosmological model, thereby avoiding the need to use the various inexact fitting formulae that exist in the literature.},

@article{Seljak:1996,
	Abstract = {We present a new method for calculating linear cosmic microwave background (CM B) anisotropy spectra based on integration over sources along the photon past light cone. In this approach the temperature anisotropy is written as a time integral over the product of a geometrical term and a source term. The geometrical term is given by radial eigenfunctions, which do not depend on the particular cosmological model. The source term can be expressed in terms of photon, baryon, and metric perturbations, all of which can be calculated using a small number of differential equations. This split clearly separates the dynamical from the geometrical effects on the CMB anisotropies. More importantly, it allows us to significantly reduce the computational time compared to standard methods. This is achieved because the source term, which depends on the model and is generally the most time-consuming part of calculation, is a slowly varying function of wavelength and needs to be evaluated only in a small number of points. The geometrical term, which oscillates much more rapidly than the source term, does not depend on the particular model and can be precomputed in advance. Standard methods that do not separate the two terms require a much higher number of evaluations. The new method leads to about 2 orders of magnitude reduction in CPU time when compared to standard methods and typically requires a few minutes on a workstation for a single model. The method should be especially useful for accurate determinations of cosmological parameters from CMB anisotropy and polarization measurements that will become with the next generation of experiments. A program implementing this method can be obtained from the authors.},

	Abstract = {This paper is the first in a series which studies interactions between M31 and its satellites, including the origin of the giant southern stream. We construct accurate yet simple analytic models for the potential of the M31 galaxy to provide an easy basis for the calculation of orbits in M31's halo. We use a Navarro, Frenk and White (NFW) dark halo, an exponential disc, a Hernquist bulge, and a central black hole point mass to describe the galaxy potential. We constrain the parameters of these functions by comparing to existing surface-brightness, velocity-dispersion, and rotation-curve measurements of M31. Our description provides a good fit to the observations, and agrees well with more sophisticated modelling of M31. While in many respects the parameter set is well constrained, there is substantial uncertainty in the outer halo potential and a near-degeneracy between the disc and halo components, producing a large, nearly two-dimensional allowed region in parameter space. We limit the allowed region using theoretical expectations for the halo concentration, baryonic content, and stellar mass-to-light ratio (M/LR), finding a smaller region where the parameters are physically plausible. Our proposed mass model for M31 has Mbulge= 3.2 × 1010Msolar, Mdisc= 7.2 × 1010Msolar, and M200= 7.1 × 1011Msolar, with uncorrected (for internal and foreground extinction) mass-to-light ratios of M/LR= 3.9 and 3.3 for the bulge and disc, respectively. We present some illustrative test-particle orbits for the progenitor of the stellar stream in our galaxy potential, highlighting the effects of the remaining uncertainty in the disc and halo masses.},

@article{Yin:2009,
	Abstract = {Aims: We study the chemical evolution of the disks of the Milky Way (MW) and of Andromeda (M 31), to identify the common properties and differences between the two major galaxies of the Local Group.  Methods: We use a large set of observational data for M 31, including observations of the star formation rate (SFR) and gas profiles, as well as stellar metallicity distributions along its disk. When expressed in terms of the corresponding disk scale lengths, we show that the observed radial profiles of MW and M 31 exhibit interesting similarities, suggesting the possibility of a description within a common framework. Results: We find that the profiles of stars, gas fraction, and metallicity of the two galaxies, as well as most of their global properties, are well described by our model, provided that the star formation efficiency in M 31 disk is twice as high as in the MW. We show that the star formation rate profile of M 31 cannot be described by any form of the Kennicutt-Schmidt law (KS Law) for star formation. We propose that these discrepancies are caused by the fact that M 31 has an active star formation history in the recent past, consistent with the hypotheses of a ``head-on'' collision with the neighboring galaxy (most probably M 32) about 200 Myr ago.  Conclusions: The MW has most probably experienced quiescent secular evolution, making possible a fairly successful description with a simple model. If M 31 is more typical of spiral galaxies, more complex models, involving galaxy interactions, will be required for the description of spirals.},

We find that the luminosity is in the range 9.6-13.2 x10^7 solar luminosities or M_V ~ -15.1 - 15.5, with 70% of the light residing in the debris streams. The progenitor is somewhat fainter than the present-day Small Magellanic Cloud, and comparable in brightness to the M31 dwarf spheroidals NGC 147 and NGC 185. Using cosmologically motivated models, we estimate that the mass of Sgr's dark matter halo prior to tidal disruption was ~10^10 solar masses.},

	Abstract = {The narrow GD-1 stream of stars, spanning 60 deg on the sky at a distance of ~10 kpc from the Sun and ~15 kpc from the Galactic center, is presumed to be debris from a tidally disrupted star cluster that traces out a test-particle orbit in the Milky Way halo. We combine SDSS photometry, USNO-B astrometry, and SDSS and Calar Alto spectroscopy to construct a complete, empirical 6-dimensional phase-space map of the stream. We find that an eccentric orbit in a flattened isothermal potential describes this phase-space map well. Even after marginalizing over the stream orbital parameters and the distance from the Sun to the Galactic center, the orbital fit to GD-1 places strong constraints on the circular velocity at the Sun's radius V_c=224 \pm 13 km/s and total potential flattening q_\Phi=0.87^{+0.07}_{-0.04}. When we drop any informative priors on V_c the GD-1 constraint becomes V_c=221 \pm 18 km/s. Our 6-D map of GD-1 therefore yields the best current constraint on V_c and the only strong constraint on q_\Phi at Galactocentric radii near R~15 kpc. Much, if not all, of the total potential flattening may be attributed to the mass in the stellar disk, so the GD-1 constraints on the flattening of the halo itself are weak: q_{\Phi,halo}>0.89 at 90% confidence. The greatest uncertainty in the 6-D map and the orbital analysis stems from the photometric distances, which will be obviated by Gaia.},

	Abstract = {It is generally assumed that the central galaxy in a dark matter halo, that is, the galaxy with the lowest specific potential energy, is also the brightest halo galaxy (BHG), and that it resides at rest at the centre of the dark matter potential well. This central galaxy paradigm (CGP) is an essential assumption made in various fields of astronomical research. In this paper we test the validity of the CGP using a large galaxy group catalogue constructed from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. For each group we compute two statistics, ${\cal R}$ and ${\cal S}$, which quantify the offsets of the line-of-sight velocities and projected positions of brightest group galaxies relative to the other group members. By comparing the cumulative distributions of $|{\cal R}|$ and $|{\cal S}|$ to those obtained from detailed mock group catalogues, we rule out the null-hypothesis that the CGP is correct. Rather, the data indicate that in a non-zero fraction $f_{\rm BNC}(M)$ of all haloes of mass $M$ the BHG is not the central galaxy, but instead, a satellite galaxy. In particular, we find that $f_{\rm BNC}$ increases from $\sim 0.25$ in low mass haloes ($10^{12} h^{-1} {\rm M_{\odot}} \leq M \lsim 2 \times 10^{13} h^{-1}{\rm M_{\odot}}$) to $\sim 0.4$ in massive haloes ($M \gsim 5 \times 10^{13} h^{-1} {\rm M_{\odot}}$). We show that these values of $f_{\rm BNC}$ are uncomfortably high compared to predictions from halo occupation statistics and from semi-analytical models of galaxy formation. We end by discussing various implications of a non-zero $f_{\rm BNC}(M)$, with an emphasis on the halo masses inferred from satellite kinematics.},

	Abstract = {The Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) 5-year data provide stringent limits on deviations from the minimal, six-parameter Lambda cold dark matter model. We report these limits and use them to constrain the physics of cosmic inflation via Gaussianity, adiabaticity, the power spectrum of primordial fluctuations, gravitational waves, and spatial curvature. We also constrain models of dark energy via its equation of state, parity-violating interaction, and neutrino properties, such as mass and the number of species. We detect no convincing deviations from the minimal model. The six parameters and the corresponding 68% uncertainties, derived from the WMAP data combined with the distance measurements from the Type Ia supernovae (SN) and the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) in the distribution of galaxies, are: Omega b  h 2 = 0.02267+0.00058 -0.00059, Omega c  h 2 = 0.1131 $\pm$ 0.0034, OmegaLambda = 0.726 $\pm$ 0.015, ns = 0.960 $\pm$ 0.013, tau = 0.084 $\pm$ 0.016, and \Delta _{\cal R}^2 = (2.445\pm 0.096)\times 10^{-9} at k = 0.002 Mpc-1. From these, we derive sigma8 = 0.812 $\pm$ 0.026, H 0 = 70.5 $\pm$ 1.3 km s-1 Mpc-1, Omega b  = 0.0456 $\pm$ 0.0015, Omega c  = 0.228 $\pm$ 0.013, Omega m  h 2 = 0.1358+0.0037 -0.0036, z reion = 10.9 $\pm$ 1.4, and t 0 = 13.72 $\pm$ 0.12 Gyr. With the WMAP data combined with BAO and SN, we find the limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of r < 0.22(95%CL), and that ns > 1 is disfavored even when gravitational waves are included, which constrains the models of inflation that can produce significant gravitational waves, such as chaotic or power-law inflation models, or a blue spectrum, such as hybrid inflation models. We obtain tight, simultaneous limits on the (constant) equation of state of dark energy and the spatial curvature of the universe: -0.14 < 1 + w < 0.12(95%CL) and -0.0179 < Omega k  < 0.0081(95%CL). We provide a set of "WMAP distance priors," to test a variety of dark energy models with spatial curvature. We test a time-dependent w with a present value constrained as -0.33 < 1 + w 0 < 0.21 (95% CL). Temperature and dark matter fluctuations are found to obey the adiabatic relation to within 8.9% and 2.1% for the axion-type and curvaton-type dark matter, respectively. The power spectra of TB and EB correlations constrain a parity-violating interaction, which rotates the polarization angle and converts E to B. The polarization angle could not be rotated more than -5fdg9 < Deltaalpha < 2fdg4 (95% CL) between the decoupling and the present epoch. We find the limit on the total mass of massive neutrinos of ∑m nu < 0.67 eV(95%CL), which is free from the uncertainty in the normalization of the large-scale structure data. The number of relativistic degrees of freedom (dof), expressed in units of the effective number of neutrino species, is constrained as N eff = 4.4 $\pm$ 1.5 (68%), consistent with the standard value of 3.04. Finally, quantitative limits on physically-motivated primordial non-Gaussianity parameters are -9 < f local NL < 111 (95% CL) and -151 < f equil NL < 253 (95% CL) for the local and equilateral models, respectively.  WMAP is the result of a partnership between Princeton University and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Scientific guidance is provided by the WMAP Science Team.},

	Abstract = {Observations of the lengthy tidal streams produced by the destruction of the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal (Sgr dSph) are capable of providing strong constraints on the shape of the Galactic gravitational potential. However, previous work, based on modeling different stream properties in axisymmetric Galactic models, has yielded conflicting results: while the angular precession of the Sgr leading arm is most consistent with a spherical or slightly oblate halo, the radial velocities of stars in this arm are reproduced only by prolate halo models. We demonstrate that this apparent paradox can be resolved by instead adopting a triaxial potential. Our new Galactic halo model, which simultaneously fits all well-established phase space constraints from the Sgr stream, provides the first conclusive evidence for, and tentative measurement of, triaxiality in an individual dark matter halo. The Milky Way halo within ~60 kpc is best characterized by a minor/major axis ratio of the isovelocity contours c/a ≈ 0.67, intermediate/major axis ratio b/a ≈ 0.83, and triaxiality parameter T ~ 0.56. In this model, the minor axis of the dark halo is coincident with the Galactic X-axis connecting the Sun and the Galactic center to within ~15$\,^{\circ}$, while the major axis also lies in the Galactic plane, approximately along the Galactic Y-axis.},

	Abstract = {We demonstrate that the output of a cosmological N-body simulation can, to remarkable accuracy, be scaled to represent the growth of large-scale structure in a cosmology with parameters similar to but different from those originally assumed. Our algorithm involves three steps: a reassignment of length, mass and velocity units, a relabelling of the time axis, and a rescaling of the amplitudes of individual large-scale fluctuation modes. We test it using two matched pairs of simulations. Within each pair, one simulation assumes parameters consistent with analyses of the first-year WMAP data. The other has lower matter and baryon densities and a 15% lower fluctuation amplitude, consistent with analyses of the three-year WMAP data. The pairs differ by a factor of a thousand in mass resolution, enabling performance tests on both linear and nonlinear scales. Our scaling reproduces the mass power spectra of the target cosmology to better than 0.5% on large scales (k < 0.1 h/Mpc) both in real and in redshift space. In particular, the BAO features of the original cosmology are removed and are correctly replaced by those of the target cosmology. Errors are still below 3% for k < 1 h/Mpc. Power spectra of the dark halo distribution are even more precisely reproduced, with errors below 1% on all scales tested. A halo-by-halo comparison shows that centre-of-mass positions and velocities are reproduced to better than 90 kpc/h and 5%, respectively. Halo masses, concentrations and spins are also reproduced at about the 10% level, although with small biases. Halo assembly histories are accurately reproduced, leading to central galaxy magnitudes with errors of about 0.25 magnitudes and a bias of about 0.13 magnitudes for a representative semi-analytic model.},

	Abstract = {We calculate orbits for the Milky Way dwarf galaxies with proper motions, and compare these to subhalo orbits in a high resolution cosmological simulation. We use the simulation data to assess how well orbits may be recovered in the face of measurement errors, a time varying triaxial gravitational potential, and satellite-satellite interactions. For present measurement uncertainties, we recover the apocentre r_a and pericentre r_p to ~40%. With improved data from the Gaia satellite we should be able to recover r_a and r_p to ~14%, respectively. However, recovering the 3D positions and orbital phase of satellites over several orbits is more challenging. This owes primarily to the non-sphericity of the potential and satellite interactions during group infall. Dynamical friction, satellite mass loss and the mass evolution of the main halo play a more minor role in the uncertainties. We apply our technique to nine Milky Way dwarfs with observed proper motions. We show that their mean apocentre is lower than the mean of the most massive subhalos in our cosmological simulation, but consistent with the most massive subhalos that form before z=10. This lends further support to the idea that the Milky Way's dwarfs formed before reionisation.},

@article{Pasquali:2009,
	Abstract = {Using a large SDSS galaxy group catalogue, we study how the stellar ages and metallicities of central and satellite galaxies depend on stellar mass and halo mass. We find that satellites are older and metal-richer than centrals of the same stellar mass. In addition, the slopes of the age-stellar mass and metallicity-stellar mass relations are found to become shallower in denser environments. This is due to the fact that the average age and metallicity of low mass satellite galaxies increase with the mass of the halo in which they reside. A comparison with the semi-analytical model of Wang et al. (2008) shows that it succesfully reproduces the fact that satellites are older than centrals of the same stellar mass and that the age difference increases with the halo mass of the satellite. This is a consequence of strangulation, which leaves the stellar populations of satellites to evolve passively, while the prolonged star formation activity of centrals keeps their average ages younger. The resulting age offset is larger in more massive environments because their satellites were accreted earlier. The model fails, however, in reproducing the halo mass dependence of the metallicities of low mass satellites, yields metallicity-stellar mass and age-stellar mass relations that are too shallow, and predicts that satellite galaxies have the same metallicities as centrals of the same stellar mass, in disagreement with the data. We argue that these discrepancies are likely to indicate the need to (i) modify the recipes of both supernova feedback and AGN feedback, (ii) use a more realistic description of strangulation, and (iii) include a proper treatment of the tidal stripping, heating and destruction of satellite galaxies.

	Abstract = {We propose that the rotational kinematics of the globular cluster system (GCS) in M31 can result from a past major merger event that could have formed its bulge component. We numerically investigate kinematical properties of globular clusters (GCs) in remnants of galaxy mergers between two discs with GCs in both their disc and halo components. We find that the GCS formed during major merging can show strongly rotational kinematics with the maximum rotational velocities of ~140-170 km s-1 for a certain range of orbital parameters of merging. We also find that a rotating stellar bar, which can be morphologically identified as a boxy bulge if seen edge-on, can be formed in models for which the GCSs show strongly rotational kinematics. We thus suggest that the observed rotational kinematics of GCs with different metallicities in M31 can be closely associated with the ancient major merger event. We discuss whether the formation of the rotating bulge/bar in M31 can be due to the ancient merger.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the properties of satellite galaxies formed in N-body/SPH simulations of galaxy formation in the LambdaCDM cosmology. The simulations include the main physical effects thought to be important in galaxy formation and, in several cases, produce realistic spiral discs. In total, a sample of nine galaxies of luminosity comparable to the Milky Way was obtained. At magnitudes brighter than the resolution limit, MV = -12, the luminosity function of the satellite galaxies in the simulations is in excellent agreement with data for the Local Group. The radial number density profile of the model satellites, as well as their gas fractions also match observations very well. In agreement with previous N-body studies, we find that the satellites tend to be distributed in highly flattened configurations whose major axis is aligned with the major axis of the (generally triaxial) dark halo. In two out of three systems with sufficiently large satellite populations, the satellite system is nearly perpendicular to the plane of the galactic disc, a configuration analogous to that observed in the Milk Way. The discs themselves are perpendicular to the minor axis of their host haloes in the inner parts, and the correlation between the orientation of the galaxy and the shape of the halo persists even out to the virial radius. However, in one case the disc's minor axis ends up, at the virial radius, perpendicular to the minor axis of the halo. The angular momenta of the galaxies and their host halo tend to be well aligned.},

	Abstract = {The 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) is designed to measure redshifts for approximately 250000 galaxies. This paper describes the survey design, the spectroscopic observations, the redshift measurements and the survey data base. The 2dFGRS uses the 2dF multifibre spectrograph on the Anglo-Australian Telescope, which is capable of observing 400 objects simultaneously over a 2$\,^{\circ}$ diameter field. The source catalogue for the survey is a revised and extended version of the APM galaxy catalogue, and the targets are galaxies with extinction-corrected magnitudes brighter than bJ=19.45. The main survey regions are two declination strips, one in the southern Galactic hemisphere spanning 80$\,^{\circ}$×15$\,^{\circ}$ around the SGP, and the other in the northern Galactic hemisphere spanning 75$\,^{\circ}$×10$\,^{\circ}$ along the celestial equator; in addition, there are 99 fields spread over the southern Galactic cap. The survey covers 2000deg2 and has a median depth of z=0.11. Adaptive tiling is used to give a highly uniform sampling rate of 93 per cent over the whole survey region. Redshifts are measured from spectra covering 3600-8000{\AA} at a two-pixel resolution of 9.0{\AA} and a median S/N of 13pixel-1. All redshift identifications are visually checked and assigned a quality parameter Q in the range 1-5 Q>=3 redshifts are 98.4 per cent reliable and have an rms uncertainty of 85kms-1. The overall redshift completeness for Q>=3 redshifts is 91.8 per cent, but this varies with magnitude from 99 per cent for the brightest galaxies to 90 per cent for objects at the survey limit. The 2dFGRS data base is available on the World Wide Web at <extlink type="url">http://www.mso.anu.edu.au/2dFGRS.</extlink>},

	Abstract = {We use the conditional luminosity function Phi(L|M) dL, which gives the number of galaxies with luminosities in the range L+/- d L/2 that reside in a halo of mass M, to link the distribution of galaxies to that of dark matter haloes. Starting from the number density of dark matter haloes predicted by current models of structure formation, we seek the form of Phi(L|M) that reproduces the galaxy luminosity function and the luminosity dependence of the galaxy clustering strength. We test the models of Phi(L|M) by comparing the resulting mass-to-light ratios with constraints from the Tully-Fisher (TF) relation and from galaxy clusters. A comparison between model predictions and current observations yields a number of stringent constraints on both galaxy formation and cosmology. In particular, this method can break the degeneracy between Omega0 and the power-spectrum normalization sigma8, inherent in current weak-lensing and cluster-abundance studies. For flat LambdaCDM cosmogonies with sigma8 normalized by recent weak gravitational lensing observations, the best results are obtained for Omega0~ 0.3; Omega0<~ 0.2 leads to too large galaxy correlation lengths, while Omega0>~ 0.4 gives too high mass-to-light ratios to match the observed TF relation. The best-fitting model for the LambdaCDM concordance cosmology with Omega0= 0.3 and OmegaLambda= 0.7 predicts mass-to-light ratios that are slightly too high to match the TF relation. We discuss a number of possible effects that might remedy this problem, such as small modifications of sigma8 and the Hubble parameter with respect to the concordance values, the assumption that the Universe is dominated by warm dark matter, systematic errors in current observational data, and the existence of dark galaxies. We use the conditional luminosity function derived from the present data to predict several statistics about the distribution of galaxy light in the local Universe. We show that roughly 50 per cent of all light is produced in haloes less massive than 2 × 1012h-1 Msolar. We also derive the probability distribution P(M|L) dM that a galaxy of luminosity L resides in a halo with virial masses in the range M+/- dM/2.},

	Abstract = {We present the Mock Map Facility, a powerful tool for converting theoretical outputs of hierarchical galaxy formation models into catalogues of virtual observations. The general principle is straightforward: mock observing cones can be generated using semi-analytically post-processed snapshots of cosmological N-body simulations. These cones can then be projected to synthesize mock sky images. To this end, the paper describes in detail an efficient technique for creating such mock cones and images from the galaxies in cosmological simulations (GALICS) semi-analytic model, providing the reader with an accurate quantification of the artefacts it introduces at every step. We show that replication effects introduce a negative bias on the clustering signal - typically peaking at less than 10 per cent around the correlation length. We also thoroughly discuss how the clustering signal is affected by finite-volume effects, and show that it vanishes at scales larger than approximately one-tenth of the simulation box size. For the purpose of analysing our method, we show that number counts and redshift distributions obtained with GALICS/MOMAF compare well with K-band observations and the two-degree field galaxy redshift survey. Given finite-volume effects, we also show that the model can reproduce the automatic plate measuring machine angular correlation function. The MOMAF results discussed here are made publicly available to the astronomical community through a public data base. Moreover, a user-friendly Web interface (http://galics.iap.fr) allows any user to recover her/his own favourite galaxy samples through simple SQL queries. The flexibility of this tool should permit a variety of uses ranging from extensive comparisons between real observations and those predicted by hierarchical models of galaxy formation, to the preparation of observing strategies for deep surveys and tests of data processing pipelines.},

	Abstract = {We present a new model for computing the spectral evolution of stellar populations at ages between 1 × 105 and 2 × 1010 yr at a resolution of 3 {\AA} across the whole wavelength range from 3200 to 9500 {\AA} for a wide range of metallicities. These predictions are based on a newly available library of observed stellar spectra. We also compute the spectral evolution across a larger wavelength range, from 91 {\AA} to 160 mum, at lower resolution. The model incorporates recent progress in stellar evolution theory and an observationally motivated prescription for thermally pulsing stars on the asymptotic giant branch. The latter is supported by observations of surface brightness fluctuations in nearby stellar populations. We show that this model reproduces well the observed optical and near-infrared colour-magnitude diagrams of Galactic star clusters of various ages and metallicities. Stochastic fluctuations in the numbers of stars in different evolutionary phases can account for the full range of observed integrated colours of star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds. The model reproduces in detail typical galaxy spectra from the Early Data Release (EDR) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We exemplify how this type of spectral fit can constrain physical parameters such as the star formation history, metallicity and dust content of galaxies. Our model is the first to enable accurate studies of absorption-line strengths in galaxies containing stars over the full range of ages. Using the highest-quality spectra of the SDSS EDR, we show that this model can reproduce simultaneously the observed strengths of those Lick indices that do not depend strongly on element abundance ratios. The interpretation of such indices with our model should be particularly useful for constraining the star formation histories and metallicities of galaxies.},

	Abstract = {Analytic methods for studying the formation of galaxies by gas condensation within massive dark halos are presented. The present scheme applies to cosmogonies where structure grows through hierarchical clustering of a mixture of gas and dissipationless dark matter. The simplest models consistent with the current understanding of N-body work on dissipationless clustering, and that of numerical and analytic work on gas evolution and cooling are adopted. Standard models for the evolution of the stellar population are also employed, and new models for the way star formation heats and enriches the surrounding gas are constructed. Detailed results are presented for a cold dark matter universe with Omega = 1 and H(0) = 50 km/s/Mpc, but the present methods are applicable to other models. The present luminosity functions contain significantly more faint galaxies than are observed.},

@article{De-Lucia:2007,
	Abstract = {We use semi-analytic techniques to study the formation and evolution of brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs). We show the extreme hierarchical nature of these objects and discuss the limitations of simple ways to capture their evolution. In a model where cooling flows are suppressed at late times by active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity, the stars of BCGs are formed very early (50 per cent at z ~ 5, 80 per cent at z ~ 3) and in many small galaxies. The high star formation rates in these high-z progenitors are fuelled by rapid cooling, not by merger-triggered starbursts. We find that model BCGs assemble surprisingly late: half their final mass is typically locked up in a single galaxy after z ~ 0.5. Because most of the galaxies accreted on to BCGs have little gas content and red colours, late mergers do not change the apparent age of BCGs. It is this accumulation of a large number of old stellar populations - driven mainly by the merging history of the dark matter halo itself - that yields the observed homogeneity of BCG properties. In the second part of the paper, we discuss the evolution of BCGs to high redshifts, from both observational and theoretical viewpoints. We show that our model BCGs are in qualitative agreement with high-z observations. We discuss the hierarchical link between high-z BCGs and their local counterparts. We show that high-z BCGs belong to the same population as the massive end of local BCG progenitors, although they are not in general the same galaxies. Similarly, high-z BCGs end up as massive galaxies in the local Universe, although only a fraction of them are actually BCGs of massive clusters.},

	Abstract = {The cold dark matter model has become the leading theoretical picture for the formation of structure in the Universe. This model, together with the theory of cosmic inflation, makes a clear prediction for the initial conditions for structure formation and predicts that structures grow hierarchically through gravitational instability. Testing this model requires that the precise measurements delivered by galaxy surveys can be compared to robust and equally precise theoretical calculations. Here we present a simulation of the growth of dark matter structure using 2,1603 particles, following them from redshift z = 127 to the present in a cube-shaped region 2.230 billion lightyears on a side. In postprocessing, we also follow the formation and evolution of the galaxies and quasars. We show that baryon-induced features in the initial conditions of the Universe are reflected in distorted form in the low-redshift galaxy distribution, an effect that can be used to constrain the nature of dark energy with future generations of observational surveys of galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We analyse the dynamical properties of substructures in a high-resolution dark matter simulation of the formation of a Milky Way-like halo in a Lambdacold dark matter cosmology. Our goal is to shed light on the dynamical peculiarities of the Milky Way satellites. Our simulations show that about one-third of the subhaloes have been accreted in groups. We quantify this clustering by measuring the alignment of the angular momentum of subhaloes in a group. We find that this signal is visible even for objects accreted up to z ~ 1, i.e. 8 Gyr ago, and long after the spatial coherence of the groups has been lost due the host tidal field. This group infall may well explain the ghostly streams proposed by Lynden-Bell & Lynden-Bell to orbit the Milky Way. Our analyses also show that if most satellites originate in a few groups, the disc-like distribution of the Milky Way satellites would be almost inevitable. This non-random assignment of satellites to subhaloes implies an environmental dependence on whether these low-mass objects are able to form stars, possibly related to the nature of reionization in the early Universe. With this picture, both the `ghostly streams' and the `disc-like configuration' are manifestations of the same phenomenon: the hierarchical growth of structure down to the smallest scales.},

	Abstract = {Nearby clusters such as Virgo and Coma possess galaxy distributions that tend to be aligned with the principal axis of the cluster itself. This has also been confirmed by a recent statistical analysis of some 300 Abell clusters, where the effect has been linked to the dynamical state of the cluster. Moreover, the orbits of satellite galaxies in galactic systems like our own Milky Way also demonstrate a high degree of anisotropy-the so-called Holmberg effect, the origin of which has been the subject of debate for more than 30 years. This study presents the analysis of cosmological simulations focusing on the orbits of satellite galaxies within dark matter halos. The apocenters of the orbits of these satellites are preferentially found within a cone of opening angle ~40$\,^{\circ}$ around the major axis of the host halo, in accordance with the observed anisotropy found in galaxy clusters. We do, however, note that a link to the dynamical age of the cluster is not well established, as both of our oldest dark matter halos do show a clear anisotropy signal. Further analysis connects this distribution to the infall pattern of satellites along the filaments: the orbits are determined rather by the environment of the host halo than some ``dynamical selection'' during their life within the host's virial radius.},

	Abstract = {In two recent papers, we developed a powerful technique to link the distribution of galaxies to that of dark matter haloes by considering halo occupation numbers as a function of galaxy luminosity and type. In this paper we use these distribution functions to populate dark matter haloes in high-resolution N-body simulations of the standard LambdaCDM cosmology with Omegam= 0.3, OmegaLambda= 0.7 and sigma8= 0.9. Stacking simulation boxes of 100 h-1 Mpc and 300 h-1 Mpc with 5123 particles each we construct mock galaxy redshift surveys out to a redshift of z= 0.2 with a numerical resolution that guarantees completeness down to 0.01L*. We use these mock surveys to investigate various clustering statistics. The predicted two-dimensional correlation function xi(rp, pi) reveals clear signatures of redshift space distortions. The projected correlation functions for galaxies with different luminosities and types, derived from xi(rp, pi), match the observations well on scales larger than ~3 h-1 Mpc. On smaller scales, however, the model overpredicts the clustering power by about a factor two. Modelling the `finger-of-God' effect on small scales reveals that the standard LambdaCDM model predicts pairwise velocity dispersions (PVD) that are ~400 km s-1 too high at projected pair separations of ~1 h-1 Mpc. A strong velocity bias in massive haloes, with bvel≡sigmagal/sigmadm~ 0.6 (where sigmagal and sigmadm are the velocity dispersions of galaxies and dark matter particles, respectively) can reduce the predicted PVD to the observed level, but does not help to resolve the overprediction of clustering power on small scales. Consistent results can be obtained within the standard LambdaCDM model only when the average mass-to-light ratio of clusters is of the order of 1000 (M/L)solar in the B-band. Alternatively, as we show by a simple approximation, a LambdaCDM model with sigma8~= 0.75 may also reproduce the observational results. We discuss our results in light of the recent WMAP results and the constraints on sigma8 obtained independently from other observations.},

	Abstract = {We use high-resolution N-body simulations to study the equilibrium density profiles of dark matter halos in hierarchically clustering universes. We find that all such profiles have the same shape, independent of the halo mass, the initial density fluctuation spectrum, and the values of the cosmological parameters. Spherically averaged equilibrium profiles are well fitted over two decades in radius by a simple formula originally proposed to describe the structure of galaxy clusters in a cold dark matter universe. In any particular cosmology, the two scale parameters of the fit, the halo mass and its characteristic density, are strongly correlated. Low-mass halos are significantly denser than more massive systems, a correlation that reflects the higher collapse redshift of small halos. The characteristic density of an equilibrium halo is proportional to the density of the universe at the time it was assembled. A suitable definition of this assembly time allows the same proportionality constant to be used for all the cosmologies that we have tested. We compare our results with previous work on halo density profiles and show that there is good agreement. We also provide a step-by-step analytic procedure, based on the Press-Schechter formalism, that allows accurate equilibrium profiles to be calculated as a function of mass in any hierarchical model.},

@article{Yang:2005,
	Abstract = {We use the halo occupation model to calibrate galaxy group finders in magnitude limited redshift surveys. Because, according to the current scenario of structure formation, galaxy groups are associated with cold dark matter (CDM) haloes, we make use of the properties of the halo population in the design of our group finder. The method starts with an assumed mass-to-light ratio to assign a tentative mass to each group. This mass is used to estimate the size and velocity dispersion of the underlying halo that hosts the group, which in turn is used to determine group membership (in redshift space). This procedure is repeated until no further changes occur in group memberships. We find that the final groups selected this way are insensitive to the mass-to-light ratio assumed. We use mock catalogues, constructed using the conditional luminosity function (CLF), to test the performance of our group finder in terms of completeness of true members and contamination by interlopers. Our group finder is more successful than the conventional friends-of-friends (FOF) group finder in assigning galaxies in common dark matter haloes to a single group. We apply our group finder to the 2-degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) and compare the resulting group properties with model predictions based on the CLF. For the LambdaCDM concordance cosmology, we find a clear discrepancy between the model and data in the sense that the model predicts too many rich groups. In order to match the observational results, we have to either increase the mass-to-light ratios of rich clusters to a level significantly higher than current observational estimates, or to assume sigma8~= 0.7, compared with the concordance value of 0.9.},

	Abstract = {Using a large galaxy group catalog based on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 4, we measure three different types of intrinsic galaxy alignment within groups: halo alignment between the orientation of the brightest group galaxies (BGG) and the distribution of its satellite galaxies, radial alignment between the orientation of a satellite galaxy and the direction toward its BGG, and direct alignment between the orientation of the BGG and that of its satellites. In agreement with previous studies, we find that satellite galaxies are preferentially located along the major axis. In addition, on scales r<0.7Rvir we find that red satellites are preferentially aligned radially with the direction to the BGG. The orientations of blue satellites, however, are perfectly consistent with being isotropic. Finally, on scales r<0.1Rvir, we find a weak but significant indication for direct alignment between satellites and BGGs. We briefly discuss the implications for weak-lensing measurements.},

	Abstract = {We use the fourth data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to investigate the orientations of 4289 satellite galaxies with respect to their hosts. The orientation of the satellites is inconsistent with a random distribution at the 99.94% confidence level, and the satellites show a preference for elongation in the direction of their hosts. Further, on scales <50 kpc the major axes of the host galaxies and their satellites are preferentially aligned. Phrased in the terminology of weak lensing, the images of the satellites have a mean shear of gammaT=-0.045+/-0.010, averaged over scales 10 kpc<=rP<=50 kpc. In a galaxy-galaxy lensing study in which lenses and sources are separated solely on the basis of apparent magnitude, we estimate that on scales <~250 kpc satellite galaxies account for between 10% and 15% of the objects that are identified as sources. In such studies, elongation of the satellites will cause a reduction of the galaxy-galaxy lensing shear by of order 25%-40%. Hence, the elongation of satellite galaxies in the direction of their hosts is a potentially important effect for precision studies of galaxy-galaxy lensing and argues strongly in favor of the use of accurate photometric redshifts in order to identify lenses and sources in future studies.},

A marginally significant tendency is found for galaxies to be aligned along the plane of the Local Supercluster. This preferential alignment effect is found to exist mainly for galaxies at high supergalactic latitude and for galaxies which are seen nearly edge-on. The results are interpreted as supporting the view that superclusters formed prior to the formation of the constituent galaxies and clusters.},

The observed distribution of this angle is inconsistent with the tidal hypothesis, and is consistent with a complete lack of correlation between the spins. When a stronger criterion for isolation is adopted, the results are still inconsistent with the tidal hypothesis, with reduced significance level.},

	Abstract = {We generalize the well-known mixtures of Gaussians approach to density estimation and the accompanying Expectation-Maximization technique for finding the maximum likelihood parameters of the mixture to the case where each data point carries an individual d-dimensional uncertainty covariance and has unique missing data properties. This algorithm reconstructs the error-deconvolved or "underlying" distribution function common to all samples, even when the individual data points are samples from different distributions, obtained by convolving the underlying distribution with the unique uncertainty distribution of the data point and projecting out the missing data directions. We show how this basic algorithm can be extended with Bayesian priors on all of the model parameters and a "split-and-merge" procedure designed to avoid local maxima of the likelihood. We apply this technique to a few typical astrophysical applications.},

This decision is often made arbitrarily or subjectively, but it need not be. A jackknife or leave-one-out cross-validation likelihood is defined and employed as a scalar objective function for optimization of the locations and widths of the bins. The objective is justified as being related to the histogram's usefulness for predicting future data. The method works for data or histograms of any dimensionality.},

	Abstract = {If the Solar System is long-lived and non-resonant (that is, if the planets are bound and have evolved independently through many orbital times), and if the system is observed at any non-special time, it is possible to infer the dynamical properties of the Solar System (such as the gravitational force or acceleration law) from a snapshot of the planet positions and velocities at a single moment in time. We consider purely radial acceleration laws of the form a_r= -A [r/r_0]^{-\alpha}, where r is the distance from the Sun. Using only an instantaneous kinematic snapshot (valid at 2009 April 1.0) for the eight major planets and a Bayesian probabilistic inference technique, we infer 1.989<\alpha<2.052 (95-percent confidence). Our results confirm those of Newton (1687) and contemporaries, who inferred \alpha=2 (with no stated uncertainty) via the comparison of computed and observationally inferred orbit shapes (closed ellipses with the Sun at one focus; Kepler 1609). Generalizations of the methods used here will permit, among other things, inference of Milky-Way dynamics from Gaia-like observations.},

	Abstract = {We present the results of a kinematic survey of the dwarf spheroidal satellite of M31, And IX, which appears to be the lowest surface brightness and also the faintest galaxy (MV=-8.3) found to date. Using Keck DEIMOS spectroscopic data, we have measured its velocity relative to M31, its velocity dispersion, and its metallicity. It exhibits a significant velocity dispersion sigmav=6.8+3.0-2.0 km s-1, which coupled with the low luminosity implies a very high mass-to-V-band light ratio, M/L~93+120-50 Msolar/Lsolar (M/L>17 Msolar/Lsolar at 99% confidence). Unless strong tidal forces have perturbed this system, this smallest of galaxies is a highly dark matter-dominated system.},

@article{McConnachie:2006,
	Abstract = {The spatial distribution of the Galactic satellite system plays an important role in Galactic dynamics and cosmology, where its successful reproduction is a key test of simulations of galaxy halo formation. Here, we examine its representative nature by conducting an analysis of the three-dimensional spatial distribution of the M31 subgroup of galaxies, the next closest system to our own. We begin by a discussion of distance estimates and incompleteness concerns, before revisiting the question of membership of the M31 subgroup. We constrain this by consideration of the spatial and kinematic properties of the putative satellites. Comparison of the distribution of M31 and Galactic satellites relative to the galactic discs suggests that the Galactic system is probably modestly incomplete at low latitudes by ~=20 per cent. We find that the radial distribution of satellites around M31 is more extended than the Galactic subgroup; 50 per cent of the Galactic satellites are found within ~100 kpc of the Galaxy, compared to ~200 kpc for M31. We search for `ghostly streams' of satellites around M31, in the same way others have done for the Galaxy, and find several, including some that contain many of the dwarf spheroidal satellites. The lack of M31-centric kinematic data, however, means that we are unable to probe whether these streams represent real physical associations. Finally, we find that the M31 satellites are asymmetrically distributed with respect to our line of sight to this object, so that the majority of its satellites are on its near side with respect to our line of sight. We quantify this result in terms of the offset between M31 and the centre of its satellite distribution, and find it to be significant at the ~ 3σ level. We discuss possible explanations for this finding, and suggest that many of the M31 satellites may have been accreted only relatively recently. Alternatively, this anisotropy may be related to a similar result recently reported for the 2dFGRS, which would imply that the halo of M31 is not yet virialized. Until such time as a satisfactory explanation for this finding is presented, however, our results warn against treating the M31 subgroup as complete, unbiased and relaxed. },

	Abstract = {We investigate the locations of the satellites of relatively isolated host galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Millennium Run simulation. Provided we use two distinct prescriptions to embed luminous galaxies within the simulated dark matter halos (ellipticals share the shapes of their halos, while disks have angular momenta that are aligned with the net angular momenta of their halos), we find a fair agreement between observation and theory. Averaged over scales r_p \le 500 kpc, the satellites of red, high-mass hosts with low star formation rates are found preferentially near the major axes of their hosts. In contrast, the satellites of blue, low-mass hosts with low star formation rates show little to no anisotropy when averaged over the same scale. The difference between the locations of the satellites of red and blue hosts cannot be explained by the effects of interlopers in the data. Instead, it is caused primarily by marked differences in the dependence of the mean satellite location, <\phi>, on the projected distance at which the satellites are found. We also find that the locations of red, high-mass satellites with low star formation rates show considerably more anisotropy than do the locations of blue, low--mass satellites with high star formation rates. There are two contributors to this result. First, the blue satellites have only recently arrived within their hosts' halos, while the red satellites arrived in the far distant past. Second, the sample of blue satellites is heavily contaminated by interlopers, which suppresses the measured anisotropy compared to the intrinsic anisotropy. },

	Abstract = {We explore the angular distribution of two samples of satellite galaxies orbiting isolated hosts extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 4. We find a clear alignment of the satellites along the major axis of their hosts when restricting the analysis to red-coloured hosts. The anisotropy is most pronounced for red satellites of red hosts. We find that the distribution of the satellites about blue, isolated hosts is consistent with isotropy. We show that under the assumption that the true, underlying distribution of satellites of blue hosts exhibits the same anisotropy as the satellites of red hosts, the sample of blue hosts is too small to measure this anisotropy at a statistically significant level. The anisotropy that we detect for satellites about red hosts is independent of the projected radius. In particular, it is evident at large projected distances from the hosts (300 < rp < 500 kpc). },

	Abstract = {The highly flattened distribution of satellite galaxies in the Milky Way (MW) presents a number of puzzles. First, its polar alignment stands out from the planar alignments commonly found in other galaxies. Secondly, recent proper-motion measurements reveal that the orbital angular momentum of at least three, and possibly as many as eight, of the MW's satellites points (within 30$\,^{\circ}$) along the axis of their flattened configuration, suggesting some form of coherent motion. In this paper, we use a high-resolution cosmological simulation to investigate whether this pattern conflicts with the expectations of the cold dark matter model of structure formation. We find that this seemingly unlikely setup occurs often: approximately 35 per cent of the time, we find systems in which the angular momentum of three individual satellites points along, or close to, the short axis of the satellite distribution. In addition, in 30 per cent of the systems we find that the net angular momentum of the six best-aligned satellites lies within 35$\,^{\circ}$ of the short axis of the satellite distribution, as observed for the MW. },

	Abstract = {We analyze the angular distribution and the orbital rotation directions of a sample of carefully selected satellite galaxies about disk galaxy primaries extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We complement this analysis with a theoretical study of these statistics in an N-body simulation of cosmological structure formation set within the ΛCDM paradigm under various assumptions for the orientations of disk angular momenta. Under the assumption that the angular momenta of the disks are aligned with the angular momenta of the inner regions of their host dark matter halos, we find that the fraction of simulated satellite halos that exhibit prograde motion is fprog~0.55-0.60, with larger satellites more likely to be prograde. In our observational sample, approximately 60% of the satellites exhibit prograde motion, a result that is broadly consistent with the simulated sample. Our observational sample of satellite galaxies shows no evidence for an anisotropic satellite distribution relative to disk primaries; however, the small sample size does not yet support a statistically significant comparison to previous studies of satellite anisotropy. Again, this result is broadly consistent with our simulated sample of satellites under the assumption that disk and halo angular momenta are aligned. However, the small size of our observational sample does not yet allow us to distinguish between various assumptions regarding the orientations of disks in their halos. Finally, we present an assessment of the importance of contamination by interlopers on the measured prograde and retrograde statistics. },

	Abstract = {We compute the locations of satellite galaxies with respect to their hosts using the ΛCDM GIF simulation. If the major axes of the hosts' images are perfectly aligned with the major axes of the projected mass, the satellites are located preferentially close to the hosts' major axes. In this case, the degree of anisotropy in the satellite locations is a good tracer of the flattening of the hosts' halos. If all hosts have luminous circular disks, the symmetry axes of the projected mass and light are not perfectly aligned, and the locations of the satellites depend on how the hosts' disks are placed within their halos. If the disk angular momentum vectors are aligned with the major axes of the halos, the satellites show a pronounced Holmberg effect. If the disk angular momentum vectors are aligned with the intermediate axes of the local large-scale structure, the distribution of the satellite locations is essentially isotropic. If the disk angular momentum vectors are aligned with either the minor axes or with the net angular momentum vectors of the halos, the satellites are distributed anisotropically about their hosts, with a preference for being found near the hosts' major axes. This agrees well with the observation that satellite galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey tend to be found near the major axes of their hosts and suggests that the mass and light of SDSS host galaxies must be fairly well aligned in projection on the sky. },

	Abstract = {We compute the two-point image correlation function for bright galaxies in the seventh data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) over angular scales 0.01' <= \theta <= 120' and projected separations 0.01 Mpc <= r <= 10 Mpc. We restrict our analysis to SDSS galaxies with accurate spectroscopic redshifts, and we find strong evidence for intrinsic alignment of the galaxy images. On scales greater than r ~ 40 kpc, the intrinsic alignment of the SDSS galaxy images compares well with the intrinsic alignment of galaxy images in a Lambda-CDM universe, provided we impose Gaussian-random errors on the position angles of the theoretical galaxies with a dispersion of 25 degrees. Without the inclusion of these errors, the amplitude of the two-point image correlation function for the theoretical galaxies is a factor of ~2 higher than it is for the SDSS galaxies. We interpret this as a combination of modest position angle errors for the SDSS galaxies, as well as a need for modest misalignment of mass and light in the theoretical galaxies. The intrinsic alignment of the SDSS galaxies shows no dependence on the specific star formation rates of the galaxies and, at most, a very weak dependence on the colors and stellar masses of the galaxies. At the ~3-sigma level, however, we find an indication that the images of the most luminous SDSS galaxies are more strongly aligned with each other than are the images of the least luminous SDSS galaxies. },

	Abstract = {Masers found in massive star-forming regions can be located precisely in six-dimensional phase space and therefore serve as a tool for studying Milky Way dynamics. The non-random orbital phases at which the masers are found and the sparseness of current samples require modeling. Here, we model the phase-space distribution function of 18 precisely measured Galactic masers, permitting a mean velocity offset and a general velocity dispersion tensor relative to their local standards of rest, and accounting for different pieces of prior information. With priors only on the Sun's distance from the Galactic Center and on its motion with respect to the local standard of rest, the maser data provide a weak constraint on the circular velocity at the Sun of Vc = 246 $\pm$ 30 km s-1. Including prior information on the proper motion of Sgr A* leads to Vc = 244 $\pm$ 13 km s-1. We do not confirm the value of Vc ≈ 254 km s-1 found in more restrictive models. This analysis shows that there is no conflict between recent determinations of Vc from Galactic Center analyses, orbital fitting of the GD-1 stellar stream, and the kinematics of Galactic masers; a combined estimate is Vc = 236 $\pm$ 11 km s-1. Apart from the dynamical parameters, we find that masers tend to occur at post-apocenter, circular-velocity-lagging phases of their orbits. },

	Abstract = {In the past several years high resolution kinematic data sets from Milky Way satellite galaxies have confirmed earlier indications that these systems are dark matter dominated objects. Further understanding of what these galaxies reveal about cosmology and the small scale structure of dark matter relies in large part on a more detailed interpretation of their internal kinematics. This article discusses a likelihood formalism that extracts important quantities from the kinematic data, including the amplitude of rotation, proper motion, and the mass distribution. In the simplest model the projected error on the rotational amplitude is shown to be $\sim 0.5 $ km s$^{-1}$ with $\sim 10^3$ stars from either classical or ultra-faint satellites. The galaxy Sculptor is analyzed for the presence of a rotational signal; no significant detection of rotation is found, and given this result limits are derived on the Sculptor proper motion. A criteria for model selection is discussed that determines the parameters required to describe the dark matter halo density profiles and the stellar velocity anisotropy. Applied to four data sets with a wide range of velocities, the likelihood is found to be more sensitive to variations in the slope of the dark matter density profile than variations in the velocity anisotropy. Models with variable radial velocity anisotropy are shown to be preferred relative to those in which this quantity is constant at all radii in the galaxy. },

	Abstract = {An imaging survey of 341 nearby early-type galaxies in the near-infrared K-band atmospheric window (2.2 μm) is described. The galaxies primarily reside in 13 nearby rich clusters (85%), while some additional galaxies are drawn from loose groups (12%) and the general field (3%). Surface photometry was measured for the entire sample. Detailed corrections were derived from an extensive grid of seeing-convolved r^1/4 models and then applied to the isophotal surface brightness, aperture magnitude, and ellipticity profiles. Global photometric parameters were derived from this seeing-corrected photometry. More than 25% of the sample has been observed at least twice, and these repeat measurements demonstrate the small internal uncertainties on the derived global photometric parameters. Extensive comparisons with aperture photometry from the literature demonstrate that the photometric system is fully consistent with other photometric systems to <=0.01 mag and confirm the estimates of internal random uncertainties. Additional global parameters are drawn from the literature in a homogeneous manner in order to construct a large catalog of galaxy properties: 95% of the galaxies have a velocity dispersion, 69% have a Mg_2 index, 80% have an optical r_eff and μ_eff, 82% have a D_n, and 81% have a derived optical-infrared color measurement. This large data set provides excellent source material for investigations of the physical origins of the global scaling relations of early-type galaxies, velocity fields in the local universe, and comparisons to higher redshift early-type galaxies. },

	Abstract = {Optical multislit spectra of globular clusters in two giant elliptical galaxies in the Virgo Cluster indicate average metal abundances of one-sixth and one-tenth solar composition for M49 and M87, respectively. These estimates are based on the strength of Mg lines. Taken together with observations of globular clusters in dwarf ellipticals this suggests a direct relation between mean metallicity of the cluster system and the luminosity of the parent galaxy which is an interesting constraint on theories of cluster formation during the protogalactic epoch. Rotation is evident in both globular cluster systems. The line-of-sight velocity dispersions of clusters in the two galaxies are estimated to be 340 + or - 50 km/s (M49) and 386 + or - 42 km/s (M87). Although sparsely sampled, the velocity dispersion profiles of the cluster systems are flat, suggesting the existence of an isothermal halo of dark matter in these ellipticals. },

@article{Faber:1976,
	Abstract = {Velocity dispersions for 25 E and S0 galaxies are presented which were measured by employing conventional and Fourier techniques to reduce spectral data obtained in scans of the nuclear regions with an image-dissector scanner. The estimates are based primarily on certain sensitive blends near the Mg b triplet and also on the width of the Na D line. Nuclear values of the mass-to-light ratio (M/L(B)) are calculated using measured values of core radii and central surface brightnesses for several of the sampled galaxies, and it is found that the mean value of M/L(B) for giant ellipticals with an absolute bolometric magnitude of less than -20 is 7(H/50) in solar units. This value agrees well with the values for early-type spirals, implies that there is no large discontinuity in M/L between early-type spirals and ellipticals, and constitutes evidence against a stellar population strongly enriched in M-dwarfs. Both velocity dispersion and M/L(B) are found to be correlated with absolute magnitude for normal ellipticals, and the observed increase in M/L(B) is shown to be consistent with an increase in metal abundance with luminosity. It is concluded that ellipticals are close to being a one-parameter family with total mass as the most important independent variable. },

	Abstract = {Near-infrared imaging data on 251 early-type galaxies in clusters and groups are used to construct the near-infrared fundamental plane (FP) r_eff ~ sigma^1.53+/-0.08_0<Sigma_K>^-0.79+/-0.03_eff. The slope of the FP therefore departs from the virial expectation of r_eff ~ sigma^2_0<Sigma>^-1_eff at all optical and near-infrared wavelengths, which could be a result of the variation of M/L along the elliptical galaxy sequence or a systematic breakdown of homology among the family of elliptical galaxies. The slope of the near-infrared FP excludes metallicity variations as the sole cause of the slope of the FP. Age effects, dynamical deviations from a homology, or any combination of these (with or without metallicity), however, are not excluded. The scatter of both the near-infrared and optical FP are nearly identical and substantially larger than the observational uncertainties, demonstrating small but significant intrinsic cosmological scatter for the FP at all wavelengths. The lack of a correlation of the residuals of the near-infrared FP and the residuals from the Mg_2-sigma_0 relation indicates that the thickness of these relations cannot be ascribed only to age or metallicity effects. Because of this metallicity independence, the small scatter of the near-infrared FP excludes a model in which age and metallicity effects ``conspire'' to keep the optical FP thin. All of these results suggest that the possible physical origins of the FP relations are complicated due to combined effects of variations of stellar populations and structural parameters among elliptical galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We present new full-sky temperature and polarization maps in five frequency bands from 23 to 94 GHz, based on data from the first five years of the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) sky survey. The new maps are consistent with previous maps and are more sensitive. The five-year maps incorporate several improvements in data processing made possible by the additional years of data and by a more complete analysis of the instrument calibration and in-flight beam response. We present several new tests for systematic errors in the polarization data and conclude that W-band polarization data is not yet suitable for cosmological studies, but we suggest directions for further study. We do find that Ka-band data is suitable for use; in conjunction with the additional years of data, the addition of Ka band to the previously used Q- and V-band channels significantly reduces the uncertainty in the optical depth parameter, τ. Further scientific results from the five-year data analysis are presented in six companion papers and are summarized in Section 7 of this paper. With the five-year WMAP data, we detect no convincing deviations from the minimal six-parameter ΛCDM model: a flat universe dominated by a cosmological constant, with adiabatic and nearly scale-invariant Gaussian fluctuations. Using WMAP data combined with measurements of Type Ia supernovae and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations in the galaxy distribution, we find (68% CL uncertainties): Ω b  h 2 = 0.02267+0.00058 -0.00059, Ω c  h 2 = 0.1131 $\pm$ 0.0034, ΩΛ = 0.726 $\pm$ 0.015, ns = 0.960 $\pm$ 0.013, τ = 0.084 $\pm$ 0.016, and \Delta _{\cal R}^2 = (2.445\pm 0.096)\times 10^{-9} at k = 0.002 Mpc-1. From these we derive σ8 = 0.812 $\pm$ 0.026, H 0 = 70.5 $\pm$ 1.3 km s-1 Mpc-1, Ω b  = 0.0456 $\pm$ 0.0015, Ω c  = 0.228 $\pm$ 0.013, Ω m  h 2 = 0.1358+0.0037 -0.0036, z reion = 10.9 $\pm$ 1.4, and t 0 = 13.72 $\pm$ 0.12 Gyr. The new limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio is r < 0.22(95%CL), while the evidence for a running spectral index is insignificant, dns /dln k = -0.028 $\pm$ 0.020 (68% CL). We obtain tight, simultaneous limits on the (constant) dark energy equation of state and the spatial curvature of the universe: -0.14 < 1 + w < 0.12(95%CL) and -0.0179 < Ω k  < 0.0081(95%CL). The number of relativistic degrees of freedom, expressed in units of the effective number of neutrino species, is found to be N eff = 4.4 $\pm$ 1.5 (68% CL), consistent with the standard value of 3.04. Models with N eff = 0 are disfavored at >99.5% confidence. Finally, new limits on physically motivated primordial non-Gaussianity parameters are -9 < f local NL < 111 (95% CL) and -151 < f equil NL < 253 (95% CL) for the local and equilateral models, respectively.

	Abstract = {We have analysed the shape of the Fundamental Plane (FP) for a sample of 226 E and S0 galaxies in 10 clusters of galaxies. We find that the distribution of galaxies is well approximated by a plane of the form log r_e=1.24 log sigma-0.82 log <I>_e+gammafor photometry obtained in Gunn r. This result is in good agreement with previous determinations. The FP has a scatter of 0.084 in log r_e. For galaxies with velocity dispersion larger than 100 km s^-1 the scatter is 0.073. If the FP is used for distance determinations this scatter is equivalent to 17 per cent uncertainties on distances to single galaxies. We find that the slope of the FP is not significantly different from cluster to cluster. Selection effects and measurement errors can introduce biases in the derived slope. The residuals of the FP correlate weakly with the velocity dispersion and the surface brightness. Some of the coefficients used in the literature give rather strong correlations between the residuals and absolute magnitudes. This implies that galaxies need to be selected in a homogeneous way to avoid biases of derived distances on the level of 5-10 per cent or smaller. The FP has significant intrinsic scatter. No other structural parameters like ellipticity or isophotal shape can reduce the scatter significantly. This is in contradiction to simple models, which predict that the presence of discs in E and S0 galaxies can introduce scatter in the FP. It remains unknown what the source of scatter is. It is therefore unknown whether this source produces systematic errors in distance determinations. The Mg_2-sigma relation for the cluster galaxies differs slightly from cluster to cluster. Galaxies in clusters with lower velocity dispersions have systematically lower Mg_2. The effect can be caused by both age and metallicity variations. With the current stellar population models, the best agreement with our results regarding the FP is if the offsets are mainly caused by differences in metallicity. Most of the distances that we derive from the FP imply small peculiar motions (<1000 km s^-1). The zero point of the FP must therefore be quite stable. Only for one cluster, located 28 deg from the direction towards the `Great Attractor', do we find a peculiar motion of 1300 km s^-1. This motion is reduced to 890 km s^-1 if we use the FP corrected for the offset of the Mg_2-sigma relation. This confirms earlier suggestions that the residuals from the Mg_2-sigma relation can be used to flag galaxies with deviant populations, and possibly to correct the distance determinations for the deviations.},

	Abstract = {Modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) is an empirically motivated modification of Newtonian gravity or inertia suggested by Milgrom as an alternative to cosmic dark matter. The basic idea is that at accelerations below ao ~ 10-8 cm/s2 ~ cHo/6 the effective gravitational attraction approaches √(gnao), where gn is the usual Newtonian acceleration. This simple algorithm yields flat rotation curves for spiral galaxies and a mass-rotation velocity relation of the form M ∝ V4 that forms the basis for the observed luminosity-rotation velocity relation-the Tully-Fisher law. We review the phenomenological success of MOND on scales ranging from dwarf spheroidal galaxies to superclusters and demonstrate that the evidence for dark matter can be equally well interpreted as evidence for MOND. We discuss the possible physical basis for an acceleration-based modification of Newtonian dynamics as well as the extention of MOND to cosmology and structure formation. },

@article{Pirzkal:2005,
	Abstract = {We identified 46 unresolved source candidates in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF) down to i775=29.5. Unresolved objects were identified using a parameter S, which measures the deviation from the curve of growth of a point source. Extensive testing of this parameter was carried out, including the effects of decreasing signal-to-noise ratio and of the apparent motions of stars, which demonstrated that stars brighter than i775=27.0 could be robustly identified. Low-resolution grism spectra of the 28 objects brighter than i775=27.0 identify 18 M and later stellar type dwarfs, two candidate L dwarfs, two QSOs, and four white dwarfs. Using the observed population of dwarfs with spectral type M4 or later, we derive a Galactic disk scale height of 400+/-100 pc for M and L stars. The local white dwarf density is computed to be as high as (1.1+/-0.3)×10-2 stars pc-3. On the basis of observations taken 73 days apart, we determined that no object in the field has a proper motion larger than 0.027" yr-1 (3 σ detection limit). No high-velocity white dwarfs were identified in the HUDF, and all four candidates appear more likely to be part of the Galactic thick disk. The lack of detected halo white dwarfs implies that if the dark matter halo is 12 Gyr old, white dwarfs account for less than 10% of the dark matter halo mass. },

	Abstract = {Since the Hipparcos mission and recent large scale surveys in the optical and the near-infrared, new constraints have been obtained on the structure and evolution history of the Milky Way. The population synthesis approach is a useful tool to interpret such data sets and to test scenarios of evolution of the Galaxy. We present here new constraints on evolution parameters obtained from the Besan{\c c}on model of population synthesis and analysis of optical and near-infrared star counts. The Galactic potential is computed self-consistently, in agreement with Hipparcos results and the observed rotation curve. Constraints are posed on the outer bulge structure, the warped and flared disc, the thick disc and the spheroid populations. The model is tuned to produce reliable predictions in the visible and the near-infrared in wide photometric bands from U to K. Finally, we describe applications such as photometric and astrometric simulations and a new classification tool based on a Bayesian probability estimator, which could be used in the framework of Virtual Observatories. As examples, samples of simulated star counts at different wavelengths and directions are also given.},

	Abstract = {We present a new homogeneous set of metallicity estimates based on Lick indices for 245 old globular clusters of the M31 galaxy comprised in the Revised Bologna Catalog. The metallicity distribution of the M31 globular clusters is briefly discussed and compared with that of the Milky Way. Simple parametric statistics suggests that the [Fe/H] distribution is likely not unimodal. The strong correlation between metallicity and kinematics found in previous studies is confirmed. The most metal-rich GCs tend to be packed at the center of the system and share the galactic rotation as traced by the HI disk. Although the velocity dispersion around the curve increases with decreasing metallicity, also clusters with [Fe/H]<-1.0 display a clear rotational pattern, at odds with their Milky Way counterparts. },

	Abstract = {Results are reported from an analysis of the structural properties of dynamically hot galaxies which combines central velocity dispersion, effective surface brightness, and effective radius into a new 3-space (k), in which the axes are parameters that are physically meaningful. Hot galaxies are found to divide into groups in k-space that closely parallel conventional morphological classifications, namely, luminous ellipticals, compacts, bulges, bright dwarfs, and dwarf spheroidals. A major sequence is defined by luminous ellipticals, bulges, and most compacts, which together constitute a smooth continuum in k-space. Several properties vary smoothly with mass along this continuum, including bulge-to-disk ratio, radio properties, rotation, degree of velocity anisotropy, and 'unrelaxed'. A second major sequence is comprised of dwarf ellipticals and dwarf spheroidals. It is suggested that mass loss is a major factor in hot dwarf galaxies, but the dwarf sequence cannot be simply a mass-loss sequence, as it has the wrong direction in k-space. },

	Abstract = {I investigate the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation for a sample of galaxies with extended 21 cm rotation curves spanning the range 20 km s-1<~Vf<=300 km s-1. A variety of scalings of the stellar mass-to-light ratio Υ* are considered. For each prescription for Υ*, I give fits of the form Md=AVxf. Presumably, the prescription that comes closest to the correct value will minimize the scatter in the relation. The fit with minimum scatter has A=50 Msolar km-4 s4 and x=4. This relation holds over five decades in mass. Galaxy color, stellar fraction, and Υ* are correlated with each other and with Md, in the sense that more massive galaxies tend to be more evolved. There is a systematic dependence of the degree of maximality of disks on surface brightness. High surface brightness galaxies typically have Υ*~3/4 of the maximum disk value, while low surface brightness galaxies typically attain ~1/4 of this amount. },

	Abstract = {Abstract: We use galaxy groups selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to examine the alignment between the orientation of the central galaxy (defined as the brightest group member) and the distribution of satellite galaxies. By construction, we therefore only address the alignment on scales smaller than the halo virial radius. We find a highly significant alignment of satellites with the major axis of their central galaxy. This is in qualitative agreement with the recent study of Brainerd (2005), but inconsistent with several previous studies who detected a preferential minor axis alignment. The alignment strength in our sample is strongest between red central galaxies and red satellites. On the contrary, the satellite distribution in systems with a blue central galaxy is consistent with isotropic. We also find that the alignment strength is stronger in more massive haloes and at smaller projected radii from the central galaxy. In addition, there is a weak indication that fainter (relative to the central galaxy) satellites are more strongly aligned. We present a detailed comparison with previous studies, and discuss the implications of our findings for galaxy formation. },

	Abstract = {The distribution of satellite galaxies relative to isolated host galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) is investigated. Host-satellite systems are selected using three different methods, yielding samples of ~3300, ~1600, and ~950 satellites. In the plane of the sky, the distributions of all three samples show highly significant deviations from circular symmetry (>99.99%, >99.99%, and 99.79% confidence levels, respectively), and the degree of anisotropy is a strong function of the projected radius, rp, at which the satellites are found. For rp<~100 kpc, the SDSS satellites are aligned preferentially with the major axes of the hosts. This is in stark contrast to the Holmberg effect, in which satellites are aligned with the minor axes of host galaxies. The degree of anisotropy in the distribution of the SDSS satellites decreases with rp and is consistent with an isotropic distribution at of order the 1 σ level for 250 kpc<~rp<~500 kpc. },

@article{Hawley:1975,
	Abstract = {Results of a search for anisotropy in the orientations of observed projected images of galaxies are reported. The data are taken from transparent copies of sky-survey plates. Three regions covered by a total of 15 plates are studied. To reduce and identify systematic errors, a 'double blind' scheme is used in which the plates as observed are rotated by an angle unknown to the scanner, and each plate is measured twice at two different viewing angles. The list of galaxies found in one catalog, but not the other, for a plate gives a measure of systematic error in selecting galaxies, while the list of galaxies found in both catalogs gives a measure of random and systematic errors in measurement. A total of 5559 galaxies have been measured in both catalogs. A small but significant departure from isotropy is found, but there is no reason to believe the effect is real because it does not satisfy tests of reproducibility. No evidence of anisotropy is found in the relative orientations of pairs of galaxies separated by less than about 1 Mpc (H = 100 km/sec per Mpc). For the galaxies in the Coma cluster proper, no evidence for anisotropy relative to a fixed direction in space is found. There is a possible indication that the galaxies are preferentially aligned along the radius vector to the center of the cluster. },

	Abstract = {We investigate the evolution of a population of 100 dark matter satellites orbiting in the gravitational potential of a realistic model of M31. We find that after 10 Gyr, seven subhalos are completely disrupted by the tidal field of the host galaxy. The remaining satellites suffer heavy mass loss and, overall, 75% of the mass initially in the subhalo system is tidally stripped. Not surprisingly, satellites with pericentric radius less than 30 kpc suffer the greatest stripping and leave a complex structure of tails and streams of debris around the host galaxy. Assuming that the most bound particles in each subhalo are kinematic tracers of stars, we find that the halo stellar population resulting from the tidal debris follows an r-3.5 density profile at large radii. We construct B-band photometric maps of stars coming from disrupted satellites and find conspicuous features similar in both morphology and brightness to the observed giant stream around Andromeda. While an assumed star formation efficiency of 5% in the simulated satellite galaxies results in good agreement with the observed V-band surface brightness of M31's stellar halo, an efficiency of 1%-2% accounts for the brightness of the giant stream. During the first 5 Gyr, the bombardment of the satellites heats and thickens the disk by a small amount. At about 5 Gyr, satellite interactions induce the formation of a strong bar, which, in turn, leads to a significant increase in the velocity dispersion of the disk. },

	Abstract = {Abstract: We use a semianalytic galaxy catalogue constructed from the Millennium Simulation to study the satellites of isolated galaxies in the LCDM cosmogony. This sample (~80,000$ bright primaries, surrounded by ~178,000 satellites) allows the characterization, with minimal statistical uncertainty, of the dynamical properties of satellite/primary galaxy systems in a LCDM universe. We find that, overall, the satellite population traces the dark matter rather well: its spatial distribution and kinematics may be approximated by an NFW profile with a mildly anisotropic velocity distribution. Their spatial distribution is also mildly anisotropic, with a well-defined ``anti-Holmberg'' effect that reflects the misalignment between the major axis and angular momentum of the host halo. The isolation criteria for our primaries picks not only galaxies in sparse environments, but also a number of primaries at the centre of ''fossil'' groups. We find that the abundance and luminosity function of these unusual systems are in reasonable agreement with the few available observational constraints. We recover the expected L_{host} \sigma_{sat}^3 relation for LCDM models for truly-isolated primaries. Less strict primary selection, however, leads to substantial modification of the scaling relation. Our analysis also highlights a number of difficulties afflicting studies that rely on blind stacking of satellite systems to constrain the mean halo mass of the primary galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We report the discovery of a new dwarf spheroidal galaxy near M31 on the basis of INT/WFC imaging. The system, Andromeda XVII (And XVII), is located at a projected radius of ~44 kpc from M31, has a line-of-sight distance of 794+/-40 kpc measured using the tip of the red giant branch, and therefore lies well within the halo of M31. The color of the red giant branch implies a metallicity of [Fe/H]~-1.9, and we find an absolute magnitude of MV~-8.5. Three globular clusters lie near the main body of And XVII, suggesting a possible association; if any of these are confirmed, it would make And XVII exceptionally unusual among the faint dSph population. The projected position on the sky of And XVII strengthens an intriguing alignment apparent in the satellite system of M31, although with a caveat about biases stemming from the current area surveyed to significant depth. },

@article{Bailin:2008,
	Abstract = {We identify satellites of isolated galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and examine their angular distribution. Using mock catalogues generated from cosmological N-body simulations, we demonstrate that the selection criteria used to select isolated galaxies and their satellites in large galaxy redshift surveys must be very strict in order to correctly identify systems in which the primary galaxy dominates its environment. We demonstrate that the criteria used in many previous studies instead select predominantly group members. We refine a set of selection criteria for which the group contamination is estimated to be less than 7per cent and present a catalogue of the resulting sample.

The angular distribution of satellites about their host is biased towards the major axes for spheroidal galaxies and probably also for red disc galaxies (the `intermediate' class of Bailin & Harris), but is isotropic for blue disc galaxies, i.e. it is the colour of the host that determines the distribution of its satellites rather than its morphology. The similar anisotropy measured in this study to studies that were dominated by groups implies that group-specific processes are not responsible for the angular distribution. Satellites that are most likely to have been recently accreted, late-type galaxies at large projected radii, show a tendency to lie along the same axis as the surrounding large-scale structure. The orientations of isolated early- and intermediate-type galaxies also align with the surrounding large-scale structures.

We discuss the origin of the anisotropic satellite distribution and consider the implications of our results, critically assessing the respective roles played by the orientation of the visible galaxy within its dark matter halo, anisotropic accretion of satellites from the larger scale environment, and the biased nature of satellites as tracers of the underlying dark matter subhalo population.

	Abstract = {A specialized data-mining algorithm has been developed using wide-field photometry catalogs, enabling systematic and efficient searches for resolved, extremely low surface brightness satellite galaxies in the halo of the Milky Way (MW). Tested and calibrated with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 6 (SDSS-DR6) we recover all 15 MW satellites recently detected in SDSS, six known MW/Local Group dSphs in the SDSS footprint, and 19 previously known globular and open clusters. In addition, 30 point-source overdensities have been found that correspond to no cataloged objects. The detection efficiencies of the algorithm have been carefully quantified by simulating more than three million model satellites embedded in star fields typical of those observed in SDSS, covering a wide range of parameters including galaxy distance, scale length, luminosity, and Galactic latitude. We present several parameterizations of these detection limits to facilitate comparison between the observed MW satellite population and predictions. We find that all known satellites would be detected with >90% efficiency over all latitudes spanned by DR6 and that the MW satellite census within DR6 is complete to a magnitude limit of MV ≈ --6.5 and a distance of 300 kpc. Assuming all existing MW satellites contain an appreciable old stellar population and have sizes and luminosities comparable with currently known companions, we predict lower and upper limit totals of 52 and 340 MW dwarf satellites within ~260 kpc if they are uniformly distributed across the sky. This result implies that many MW satellites still remain undetected. Identifying and studying these elusive satellites in future survey data will be fundamental to test the dark matter distribution on kpc scales. },

	Abstract = {We identify, categorize, and quantify alignment effects among host and satellite galaxies using a spectroscopically-confirmed, low-redshift (z<0.23) galaxy sample from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 6. Consistent with other recent findings, we find that satellite galaxies (SGs) of red, centrally concentrated (elliptical) host galaxies (HGs) with radial velocity separation |Delta_V|<600 km/s preferentially reside near the projected major axes of their HGs. Among these, this preference is strongest for highly concentrated, red SGs. We find that fractional anisotropy increases with decreasing \Delta_V and Delta_R and is nearly 40% greater among the closest SGs (Delta_R<250 kpc/h) relative to more distant (Delta_R>500 kpc/h) SGs. For highly concentrated SGs at small (<300 kpc/h) projected separation, we observe a strong radial (hostward) alignment signal in isophotal position angles (PAs) due to isophotal twisting and contamination that is not present when using galaxy model PAs. Among objects for which both isophotal and galaxy model PAs agree to <15 degrees, this elongation signal is significantly weaker. We also investigate the "Holmberg Effect," a well-known result wherein nearby (<40 kpc/h) SGs of large, inclined spiral HGs were seen to preferentially reside near the minor axes of their HGs. Survey limitations preclude a strict test of this effect using only SDSS spectroscopic galaxies. By adopting a looser set of cuts than those of Holmberg's study, we recover a comparable preference among faint blue SGs for the HG minor axis at marginal significance (~3 sigma). We conclude that several types of alignment likely exist among different galaxy populations, but that the observed nature and strength of alignment trends depend sensitively on both selection criteria and on the method used to determine galaxy orientation. },

	Abstract = {The spatial distributions of the most recently discovered ultra-faint dwarf satellites around the Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxy are compared to the previously reported discs-of-satellites (DoS) of their host galaxies. In our investigation, we pay special attention to the selection bias introduced due to the limited sky coverage of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We find that the new Milky Way satellite galaxies follow closely the DoS defined by the more luminous dwarfs, thereby further emphasizing the statistical significance of this feature in the Galactic halo. We also note a deficit of satellite galaxies with Galactocentric distances larger than 100kpc that are away from the DoS of the Milky Way. In the case of Andromeda, we obtain similar results, naturally complementing our previous finding and strengthening the notion that the DoS are optical manifestations of a phase-space correlation of satellite galaxies. },

	Abstract = {Using detailed mock galaxy redshift surveys (MGRSs) we investigate the abundance and radial distribution of satellite galaxies. The mock surveys are constructed using large numerical simulations and the conditional luminosity function (CLF), and are compared against data from the Two Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS). We use Monte Carlo Markov chains to explore the full posterior distribution of the CLF parameter space, and show that the average relation between light and mass is tightly constrained and in excellent agreement with our previous models and with that of Vale & Ostriker. The radial number density distribution of satellite galaxies in the 2dFGRS reveals a pronounced absence of satellites at small projected separations from their host galaxies. This is (at least partly) owing to the overlap and merging of galaxy images in the 2dFGRS parent catalogue. Owing to the resulting close-pair incompleteness we are unfortunately unable to put meaningful constraints on the radial distribution of satellite galaxies; the data are consistent with a radial number density distribution that follows that of the dark matter particles, but we cannot rule out alternatives with a constant number density core. Marginalizing over the full CLF parameter space, we show that in a ΛCDM concordance cosmology the observed abundances of host and satellite galaxies in the 2dFGRS indicate a power spectrum normalization of σ8~= 0.7. The same cosmology but with σ8= 0.9 is unable to match simultaneously the abundances of host and satellite galaxies. This confirms our previous conclusions based on the pairwise peculiar velocity dispersions and the group multiplicity function. },

	Abstract = {We find that satellites of isolated disk galaxies at projected radii between 300 and 500 kpc are distributed asymmetrically about the parent galaxy and aligned preferentially with the disk minor axis. The dynamical timescale at these radii is sufficiently long that the shape of this distribution must reflect the formation history of the outer halo rather than its internal evolution. We also find that the orbital angular momenta of satellites at projected major axis distances of <~ 200 kpc tend to align with that of the central disk. These results demonstrate that satellites are dynamically related to their primary galaxy. Satellites drawn from current simulations of hierarchical galaxy formation exhibit neither the systematic alignment nor the net rotation with the central disk that we find in the data. },

	Abstract = {We have analysed a sample of satellite and primary galaxies in the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey. In our study we find strong statistical evidence of the Holmberg effect (that is, a tendency for satellites to avoid regions along the line defined by the primary plane) within 500 kpc of the projected distance to the primary. This effect is present only when we restrict our analysis to objects with radial velocity relative to the primary |Δv| < 160 km s-1, which corresponds approximately to the mean of the distribution. We explore the dependence of this anisotropy on spectral type (η), colours and luminosities of both primaries and satellites, finding that objects with a low present-day star formation rate present the most significant effect.},

In 1946, Eric Holmberg demonstrated that the size, shape, and integrated luminosity of a galaxy derived from measurements performed on its photographic image are more accurately determined with a photoelectric microphotometer than with visual methods alone. He found that the luminosity function depends on the morphological type of a galaxy and that the surface density of satellites in the polar sectors of a spiral galaxy is larger than in the equatorial sectors at corresponding radial intervals. },

	Abstract = {We use the integral-field spectrograph SAURON to measure the stellar line-of-sight velocity distribution and absorption line strengths out to four effective radii (Re) in the early-type galaxies NGC 3379 and 821. With our newly developed observing technique, we can now probe these faint regions in galaxies that were previously not accessible with traditional long-slit spectroscopy. We make optimal use of the large field-of-view and high throughput of the spectrograph: by adding the signal of all ~1400 lenslets into one spectrum, we obtain sufficient signal-to-noise in a few hours of observing time to reliably measure the absorption line kinematics and line strengths out to large radius.

We find that the line strength gradients previously observed within 1 Re remain constant out to at least 4 Re, which puts constraints on the merger histories of these galaxies. The stellar halo populations are old and metal poor. By constructing orbit-based Schwarzschild dynamical models, we find that dark matter is necessary to explain the observed kinematics in NGC 3379 and 821, with 30-50 per cent of the total matter being dark within 4 Re. The radial anisotropy in our best-fitting halo models is less than in our models without halo, due to differences in orbital structure. The halo also has an effect on the Mgb-Vesc relation: its slope is steeper when a dark matter halo is added to the model. },

@article{Metz:2007,
	Abstract = {There are two fundamentally different physical origins of faint satellite galaxies: cosmological substructures that contain shining baryons and the fragmentation of gas-rich tidal arms thrown out from interacting galaxies during hierarchical structure formation. The latter tidal dwarf galaxies (TDGs) may form populations with correlated orbital angular momenta about their host galaxies. The existence of TDGs is a stringent necessity because they arise as a result of fundamental physical principles. We determine the significance of the apparent disc-like distribution of Milky Way (MW) satellite galaxies. The distribution of the MW satellites is found to be inconsistent with an isotropic or prolate dark matter substructure distribution at a 99.5 per cent level including the recently discovered Ursa Major and Canes Venatici dwarf spheroidal galaxies. The distribution is extremely oblate and inclined by about 88$\,^{\circ}$ with respect to the the MW disc. We also apply the methods to Andromeda's (M31) satellite galaxies using two recently published data sets. It cannot be excluded that the whole population of M31 companions is drawn randomly from an isotropic parent distribution. However, two subsamples of Andromeda satellites are identified which have disc-like features. A kinematically motivated subsample of eight Andromeda satellites form a pronounced disc-like distribution in both data sets. The existence of this disc would be inconsistent with a cold dark matter parent distribution of subhaloes if the disc is rotationally supported. The M31 satellite distribution is inclined by about 59$\,^{\circ}$ with respect to the M31 disc, and has virtually the same orientation as the disc derived for the whole M31 satellite sample. We present a new geometric method to set restrictions on possible locations of angular momentum vectors for Andromeda satellites. Our conclusion is that both, the MW and M31, may indeed have satellite galaxies derived from TDGs. Further, both host-discs and both identified discs-of-satellites are highly inclined relative to the supergalactic plane. The discs-of-satellites therefore cannot be created from individual accretion events from the supergalactic plane further supporting the possibility that they are of TDG origin. },

@article{Reid:2009,
	Abstract = {We are using the Very Long Baseline Array and the Japanese VLBI Exploration of Radio Astronomy project to measure trigonometric parallaxes and proper motions of masers found in high-mass star-forming regions across the Milky Way. Early results from 18 sources locate several spiral arms. The Perseus spiral arm has a pitch angle of 16$\,^{\circ}$ $\pm$ 3$\,^{\circ}$, which favors four rather than two spiral arms for the Galaxy. Combining positions, distances, proper motions, and radial velocities yields complete three-dimensional kinematic information. We find that star-forming regions on average are orbiting the Galaxy ≈15 km s--1 slower than expected for circular orbits. By fitting the measurements to a model of the Galaxy, we estimate the distance to the Galactic center R 0 = 8.4 $\pm$ 0.6 kpc and a circular rotation speed Θ0 = 254 $\pm$ 16 km s--1. The ratio Θ0/R 0 can be determined to higher accuracy than either parameter individually, and we find it to be 30.3 $\pm$ 0.9 km s--1 kpc--1, in good agreement with the angular rotation rate determined from the proper motion of Sgr A*. The data favor a rotation curve for the Galaxy that is nearly flat or slightly rising with Galactocentric distance. Kinematic distances are generally too large, sometimes by factors greater than 2; they can be brought into better agreement with the trigonometric parallaxes by increasing Θ0/R 0 from the IAU recommended value of 25.9 km s--1 kpc--1 to a value near 30 km s--1 kpc--1. We offer a "revised" prescription for calculating kinematic distances and their uncertainties, as well as a new approach for defining Galactic coordinates. Finally, our estimates of Θ0 and Θ0/R 0, when coupled with direct estimates of R 0, provide evidence that the rotation curve of the Milky Way is similar to that of the Andromeda galaxy, suggesting that the dark matter halos of these two dominant Local Group galaxy are comparably massive. },

	Abstract = {A robust analysis of galaxy structural parameters, based on the modeling of bulge and disk brightnesses in the BVRH bandpasses, is presented for 121 face-on and moderately inclined late-type spirals. Each surface brightness (SB) profile is decomposed into a sum of a generalized S{\'e}rsic bulge and an exponential disk. The reliability and limitations of our bulge-to-disk (B/D) decompositions are tested with extensive simulations of galaxy brightness profiles (one-dimensional) and images (two-dimensional). We have used repeat observations to test the consistency of our decompositions. The average systematic model errors are <~20% and <~5% for the bulge and disk components, respectively. The final set of galaxy parameters is studied for variations and correlations in the context of profile type differences and wavelength dependencies. Galaxy types are divided into three classes according to their SB profile shapes: Freeman type I, type II, and a third ``transition'' class for galaxies whose profiles change from type II in the optical to type I in the infrared. Roughly 43%, 44%, and 13% of type I, type II, and transition galaxies, respectively, comprise our sample. Only type I galaxies, with their fully exponential disks, are adequately modeled by our two-component decompositions, and our main results focus on these profiles. We discuss possible interpretations of Freeman type II profiles. The S{\'e}rsic bulge shape parameter for nearby type I late-type spirals shows a range between n=0.1 and 2, but, on average, the underlying surface density profile for the bulge and disk of these galaxies is adequately described by a double-exponential distribution. The distribution of disk scale lengths shows a decreasing trend with increasing wavelength, consistent with a higher concentration of old stars or dust (or both) in the central regions relative to the outer disk. We confirm a coupling between the bulge and disk with a scale length ratio <re/h>=0.22+/-0.09, or <hbulge/hdisk>=0.13+/-0.06 for late-type spirals, in agreement with recent N-body simulations of disk formation. This ratio increases from ~0.20 for late-type spirals to ~0.24 for earlier types. These observations are consistent with bulges of late-type spiral galaxies being more deeply embedded in their host disk than earlier type bulges. Bulges and disks can thus preserve a nearly constant re/h but show a great range of SB for any given effective radius. The similar scaling relations for early- and late-type spirals suggest comparable formation and/or evolution scenarios for disk galaxies of all Hubble types. In the spirit of Courteau, de Jong, & Broeils but using our new, more extensive database, we interpret this result as further evidence for regulated bulge formation by redistribution of disk material to the galaxy center, in agreement with models of secular evolution of the disk. },

	Abstract = {Using the standard dynamical theory of spherical systems, we calculate the properties of spherical galaxies and clusters whose density profiles obey the universal form first obtained in high-resolution cosmological N-body simulations by Navarro, Frenk & White (NFW). We adopt three models for the internal kinematics: isotropic velocities, constant anisotropy and increasingly radial Osipkov-Merritt anisotropy. Analytical solutions are found for the radial dependence of the mass, gravitational potential, velocity dispersion, energy and virial ratio and we test their variability with the concentration parameter describing the density profile and amount of velocity anisotropy. We also compute structural parameters, such as half-mass radius, effective radius and various measures of concentration. Finally, we derive projected quantities, the surface mass density and line-of-sight as well as aperture-velocity dispersion, all of which can be directly applied in observational tests of current scenarios of structure formation. On the mass scales of galaxies, if constant mass-to-light is assumed, the NFW surface density profile is found to fit Hubble-Reynolds laws well. It is also well fitted by S{\'e}rsic R1/m laws, for m~=3, but in a much narrower range of m and with much larger effective radii than are observed. Assuming in turn reasonable values of the effective radius, the mass density profiles imply a mass-to-light ratio that increases outwards at all radii. },

	Abstract = {The highly anisotropic distribution and apparent alignment of the Galactic satellites in polar great planes begs the question of how common such distributions are. The satellite system of M31 is the only nearby system for which we currently have sufficiently accurate distances to study the three-dimensional satellite distribution. We present the spatial distribution of the 15 currently known M31 companions in a coordinate system centered on M31 and aligned with its disk. Through a detailed statistical analysis we show that the full satellite sample describes a plane that is inclined by -56$\,^{\circ}$ with respect to the poles of M31 and has an rms height of 100 kpc. At 88% the statistical significance of this plane is low, and it is unlikely to have a physical meaning. We note that the great stellar stream found near Andromeda is inclined to this plane by 7$\,^{\circ}$. Most of the M31 satellites are found within <+/-40$\,^{\circ}$ of M31's disk; i.e., there is little evidence for a Holmberg effect. If we confine our analysis to early-type dwarfs, we find a best-fit polar plane within 5$\,^{\circ}$-7$\,^{\circ}$ from the pole of M31. This polar great plane has a statistical significance of 99.7% and includes all dSphs (except for And II), M32, NGC 147, and PegDIG. The rms distance of these galaxies from the polar plane is 16 kpc. The nearby spiral M33 has a distance of only ~3 kpc from this plane, which points toward the M81 group. We discuss the anisotropic distribution of M31's early-type companions in the framework of three scenarios, namely, as remnants of the breakup of a larger progenitor, as a tracer of a prolate dark matter halo, and as a tracer of collapse along large-scale filaments. The first scenario requires that the breakup must have occurred at very early times and that the dwarfs continued to form stars thereafter to account for their stellar population content and luminosity-metallicity relation. The third scenario seems to be plausible, especially when considering the apparent alignment of our potential satellite filament with several nearby groups. The current data do not permit us to rule out any of the scenarios. Orbit information is needed to test the physical reality of the polar plane and of the different scenarios in more detail. },

	Abstract = {We investigate the ratio between the half-mass radii r_h of Galactic globular clusters and their Jacobi radii r_J given by the potential of the Milky Way and show that clusters with galactocentric distances R_{GC}>8 kpc fall into two distinct groups: one group of compact, tidally-underfilling clusters with r_h/r_J<0.05 and another group of tidally filling clusters which have 0.1 < r_h/r_J<0.3. We find no correlation between the membership of a particular cluster to one of these groups and its membership in the old or younger halo population. Based on the relaxation times and orbits of the clusters, we argue that compact clusters and most clusters in the inner Milky Way were born compact with half-mass radii r_h < 1 pc. Some of the tidally-filling clusters might have formed compact as well, but the majority likely formed with large half-mass radii. Galactic globular clusters therefore show a similar dichotomy as was recently found for globular clusters in dwarf galaxies and for young star clusters in the Milky Way. It seems likely that some of the tidally-filling clusters are evolving along the main sequence line of clusters recently discovered by Kuepper et al. (2008) and are in the process of dissolution. },

	Abstract = {We present near-infrared (NIR) surface photometry of a sample of 14 early-type spirals with observed rotation curves. In this first paper, we report the results of two-dimensional parametric and non-parametric decompositions to separate the bulge and disk components; the parametric bulge is modeled with a generalized exponential law of integer index n, and the disk with a simple exponential. We find that the derived bulge parameters, for a given galaxy, vary systematically with the bulge shape index n. The mean early-type bulge has a best-fit n = 2.6, and 80% of the sample has best n of 2 or 3. Bulges are rarely spherical; the median bulge intrinsic ellipticity is 0.33. The median early-type disk has (J-K)_d more than 0.1 mag bluer than the bulge, and a NIR disk surface brightness more than 1 mag arcsec(-2) brighter than later-type disks. Our data are consistent with the well-established correlation of both bulge and disk surface brightness with physical scale length, and we note that the location of bulges within this projection of the fundamental plane depends on their shape index n. In agreement with previous work, the ratios of bulge and disk scale lengths are consistent with a constant value r_e/r_d = 0.3; however, such value again depends on the bulge index n, implying that claims for a scale-free Hubble sequence may be premature.

	Abstract = {Using high-resolution collisionless N-body simulations we study the properties of tidal tails formed in the immediate vicinity of a two-component dwarf galaxy evolving in a static potential of the Milky Way (MW). The stellar component of the dwarf is initially in the form of a disk and the galaxy is placed on an eccentric orbit motivated by CDM-based cosmological simulations. We measure the orientation, density and velocity distribution of the stars in the tails. Due to the geometry of the orbit, in the vicinity of the dwarf, where the tails are densest and therefore most likely to be detectable, they are typically oriented towards the MW and not along the orbit. We report on an interesting phenomenon of `tidal tail flipping': on the way from the pericentre to the apocentre the old tails following the orbit are dissolved and new ones pointing towards the MW are formed over a short timescale. We also find a tight linear relation between the velocity of stars in the tidal tails and their distance from the dwarf. Using mock data sets we demonstrate that if dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies in the vicinity of the MW are tidally affected their kinematic samples are very likely contaminated by tidally stripped stars which tend to artificially inflate the measured velocity dispersion. The effect is stronger for dwarfs on their way from the peri- to the apocentre due to the formation of new tidal tails after pericentre. Realistic mass estimates of dSph galaxies thus require removal of these stars from kinematic samples. },

	Abstract = {Abstract: We review the properties of globular clusters which make them useful for studying the Galactic halo, Galactic chemical evolution, and the early stages of the formation of the Milky Way. We review the evidence that GCs have a chemical inventory similar to those of halo field stars. We discuss the abundance ratios for dSph galaxies and show that it is possible to have formed at least part the Galactic halo field stellar population by dissolving globular clusters and/or accreting dSph galaxies but only if this occurred at an early stage in the formation of the Galaxy. We review the constraints on halo formation timescales deduced from the low Mg isotopic ratios in metal-poor halo field dwarfs which indicate that AGB stars did not have time to contribute significantly, while M71 contains two populations, one without and also one with a substantial AGB contribution. We review the limited evidence for GCs with a second population showing additional contributions from SNII, currently confined to Omega Cen, M54, and M22, all of which may have been the nuclei or central regions of accreted galaxies. We check our own data for additional such GCs, and find preliminary indications that NGC 2419, a massive GC far in the outer Galactic halo, may also belong to this group. },

@article{Harris:2009,
	Abstract = {Images from the HST ACS are used to carry out a new photometric study of the globular clusters (GCs) in M104, the Sombrero galaxy. The primary focus of our study is the characteristic distribution function of linear sizes (SDF) of the GCs. We measure the effective radii for 652 clusters with PSF-convolved King and Wilson dynamical model fits. The SDF is remarkably similar to those measured for other large galaxies of all types, adding strong support to the view that it is a "universal" feature of globular cluster systems. We develop a more general interpretation of the size distribution function for globular clusters, proposing that the shape of the SDF that we see today for GCs is strongly influenced by the early rapid mass loss during their star forming stage, coupled with stochastic differences from cluster to cluster in the star formation efficiency (SFE) and their initial sizes. We find that the observed SDF shape can be accurately predicted by a simple model in which the protocluster clouds had characteristic sizes of $0.9 \pm 0.1$ pc and SFEs of $0.3 \pm 0.07$. The colors and luminosities of the M104 clusters show the clearly defined classic bimodal form. The blue sequence exhibits a mass/metallicity relation (MMR), following a scaling of heavy-element abundance with luminosity of $Z \sim L^{0.3}$ very similar to what has been found in most giant elliptical galaxies. A quantitative self-enrichment model provides a good first-order match to the data for the same initial SFE and protocluster size that were required to explain the SDF. We also discuss various forms of the globular cluster Fundamental Plane (FP) of structural parameters, and show that useful tests of it can be extended to galaxies beyond the Local Group. },

	Abstract = {While the connection between high-redshift star formation and the local universe has recently been used to understand the observed population of faint dwarf galaxies in the Milky Way (MW) halo, we explore how well these nearby objects can probe the epoch of first light. We construct a detailed, physically motivated model for the MW satellites based on the state-of-the-art Via Lactea II dark-matter simulations. Our model incorporates molecular hydrogen (H_2) cooling in low-mass systems and inhomogeneous photo-heating feedback during the internal reionization of our own galaxy. We find that the existence of MW satellites fainter than M_V ~ -5 is strong evidence for H_2 cooling in low-mass halos, while satellites with -5 > M_V > -9 were affected by hydrogen cooling and photoheating feedback. The age of stars in very low-luminosity systems and the minimum luminosity of these satellites are key predictions of our model. Most of the stars populating the brightest MW satellites could have formed after the epoch of reionization. Our models also predict a significantly larger dispersion in M_300 values than observed and a number of luminous satellites with M_300 as low as 10^6 solar masses.},

	Abstract = {Surface brightness profiles for 23 M31 star clusters were measured using images from the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 on the Hubble Space Telescope, and fit to two types of models to determine the clusters' structural properties. The clusters are primarily young (~10^8 yr) and massive (~10^4.5 solar masses), with median half-light radius 7 pc and dissolution times of a few Gyr. The properties of the M31 clusters are comparable to those of clusters of similar age in the Magellanic Clouds. Simulated star clusters are used to derive a conversion from statistical measures of cluster size to half-light radius so that the extragalactic clusters can be compared to young massive clusters in the Milky Way. All three sets of star clusters fall approximately on the same age-size relation. The young M31 clusters are expected to dissolve within a few Gyr and will not survive to become old, globular clusters. However, they do appear to follow the same fundamental plane relations as old clusters; if confirmed with velocity dispersion measurements, this would be a strong indication that the star cluster fundamental plane reflects universal cluster formation conditions. },

	Abstract = {Andromeda X (And X) is a newly discovered low-luminosity M31 dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph) found by Zucker et al. (2007) in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS - York et al. 2000). In this paper, we present the first spectroscopic study of individual red giant branch stars in And X, as a part of the SPLASH Survey (Spectroscopic and Photometric Landscape of Andromeda's Stellar Halo). Using the Keck II telescope and multiobject DEIMOS spectrograph, we target two spectroscopic masks over the face of the galaxy and measure radial velocities for ~100 stars with a median accuracy of sigma_v ~ 3 km/s. The velocity histogram for this field confirms three populations of stars along the sight line: foreground Milky Way dwarfs at small negative velocities, M31 halo red giants over a broad range of velocities, and a very cold velocity ``spike'' consisting of 22 stars belonging to And X with v_rad = -163.8 +/- 1.2 km/s. By carefully considering both the random and systematic velocity errors of these stars (e.g., through duplicate star measurements), we derive an intrinsic velocity dispersion of just sigma_v = 3.9 +/- 1.2 km/s for And X, which for its size, implies a minimum mass-to-light ratio of M/L =37^{+26}_{-19} assuming the mass traces the light. Based on the clean sample of member stars, we measure the median metallicity of And X to be [Fe/H] = -1.93 +/- 0.11, with a slight radial metallicity gradient. The dispersion in metallicity is large, sigma([Fe/H]) = 0.48, possibly hinting that the galaxy retained much of its chemical enrichment products. We discuss the potential for better understanding the formation and evolution mechanisms for M31's system of dSphs through (current) kinematic and chemical abundance studies, especially in relation to the Milky Way sample.

	Abstract = {We report on deep imaging of a remote M31 globular cluster, MGC1, obtained with Gemini/GMOS. Our colour-magnitude diagram for this object extends ~5 magnitudes below the tip of the red giant branch and exhibits features consistent with an ancient metal-poor stellar population, including a long, well-populated horizontal branch. The red giant branch locus suggests MGC1 has a metal abundance [M/H] ~ -2.3. We measure the distance to MGC1 and find that it lies ~160 kpc in front of M31 with a distance modulus of 23.95 +/- 0.06. Combined with its large projected separation of 117 kpc from M31 this implies a deprojected radius of Rgc = 200 +/- 20 kpc, rendering it the most isolated known globular cluster in the Local Group by some considerable margin. We construct a radial brightness profile for MGC1 and show that it is both centrally compact and rather luminous, with Mv = -9.2. Remarkably, the cluster profile shows no evidence for a tidal limit and we are able to trace it to a radius of at least 450 pc, and possibly as far as ~900 pc. The profile exhibits a power-law fall-off with exponent -2.5, breaking to -3.5 in its outermost parts. This core-halo structure is broadly consistent with expectations derived from numerical models, and suggests that MGC1 has spent many gigayears in isolation. },

	Abstract = {We present a photometric survey of the stellar halo of the Andromeda galaxy, using Suprime-Cam on the Subaru Telescope. A detailed analysis of VI color-magnitude diagrams of the resolved stellar population is used to measure properties such as line-of-sight distance, surface brightness, metallicity, and age, and these are used to isolate and characterize different components of the M31 halo: (1) several substructures, and (2) the smooth halo. First, we study M31's halo substructure along the north-west/south-east minor axis out to R ~ 100 kpc and the south-west major axis region at R ~ 60 kpc. We confirm two substructures in the south-east halo reported by Ibata et al. (2007) and discover two overdense substructures in the north-west halo. We investigate the properties of these four substructures as well as other structures including the western shelf and find that differences in stellar populations among these systems, thereby suggesting each has a different origin. Our statistical analysis implies that the M31 halo as a whole may contain at least 16 substructures, each with a different origin. Second, we investigate the properties of an underlying, smooth and extended halo component out to R > 100 kpc. We find that the surface density of this smooth halo can be fitted to a Hernquist model of scale radius ~ 17 kpc or a power-law profile with ~ R^{-2.17 +/- 0.15}. In contrast to the relative smoothness of the halo density profile, its metallicity distribution appears to be spatially non-uniform with non-monotonic variations with radius, suggesting that the halo may still be undergoing chemo-dynamical evolution. },

@article{McConnachie:2005,
	Abstract = {We have obtained Johnson V and Gunni photometry for a large number of Local Group galaxies using the Isaac Newton Telescope Wide Field Camera (INT WFC). The majority of these galaxies are members of the M31 subgroup and the observations are deep enough to study the top few magnitudes of the red giant branch in each system. We previously measured the location of the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) for Andromeda I, Andromeda II and M33 to within systematic uncertainties of typically <0.05 mag. As the TRGB acts as a standard candle in old, metal-poor stellar populations, we were able to derive distances to each of these galaxies. Here we derive TRGB distances to the giant spiral galaxy M31 and 13 additional dwarf galaxies - NGC 205, 185, 147, Pegasus, WLM, LGS3, Cetus, Aquarius, And III, V, VI, VII and the newly discovered dwarf spheroidal And IX. The observations for each of the dwarf galaxies were intentionally taken in photometric conditions. In addition to the distances, we also self-consistently derive the median metallicity of each system from the colour of their red giant branches. This allows us to take into account the small metallicity variation of the absolute I magnitude of the TRGB. The homogeneous nature of our data and the identical analysis applied to each of the 17 Local Group galaxies ensures that these estimates form a reliable set of distance and metallicity determinations that are ideal for comparative studies of Local Group galaxy properties. },

	Abstract = {We present new velocities for 62 globular clusters in M104 (NGC 4594, the Sombrero Galaxy), 56 from 2dF on the AAT and 6 from Hydra on WIYN. Combined with previous data, we have a total sample of 108 M104 globular cluster velocities, extending to 20' radius (~60 kpc), along with BVR photometry for each of these. We use this wide-field data set to study the globular cluster kinematics and dark matter content of M104 out to 10' radius (30 kpc). We find no rotation in the globular cluster system. The edge-on nature of M104 makes it unlikely that there is strong rotation which is face-on and hence unobserved; thus, the absence of rotation over our large radial range appears to be an intrinsic feature of the globular cluster system in M104. We discuss ways to explain this low rotation, including the possibility that angular momentum has been transferred to even larger radii through galaxy mergers. The cluster velocity dispersion is ~230 km s-1 within several arcminutes of the galaxy center, and drops to ~150 km s-1 at ~10' radius. We derive the mass profile of M104 using our velocity dispersion profile, together with the Jeans equation under the assumptions of spherical symmetry and isotropy, and find excellent agreement with the mass inferred from the stellar and gas rotation curve within 3' radius. The M/LV increases from ~4 near the galaxy center to ~17 at 7' radius (~20 kpc, or 4 Re), thus giving strong support for the presence of a dark matter halo in M104. More globular cluster velocities at larger radii are needed to further study the low rotation in the globular cluster system, and to see if the dark matter halo in M104 extends beyond a radius of 30 kpc. },

Expressions are presented for the uncertainty of a measured redshift, for the internal broadening of the object, and for the uncertainty of this broadening. Comparison of the optical data with previously published 21-cm data shows no systematic errors and yields excellent agreement with the internal error analysis. The method of analyzing velocity dispersions is quite promising for further application. A series of spectra are presented as examples to show the power and limitations of the correlation techniques. },

The models are derived from explicit distribution functions for each component, and the large number of parameters permit detailed modeling of actual galaxies. We present techniques that use structural and kinematic data such as radial surface brightness profiles, rotation curves, and bulge velocity dispersion profiles to find the best-fit models for the Milky Way and M31. Through N-body realizations of these models we explore their stability against the formation of bars.

	Abstract = {We describe methods for setting up self-consistent disc-bulge-halo galaxy models. The bulge and halo distribution functions (DFs) are functions of E and L_z_ only. The halo's flattening and rotation can be specified. The disc DF is a function of E and L_z_ and a third `integral', E_z_, the vertical energy, which is approximately conserved in a warm disc with vertical extent. The models also have finite extent, making them suitable for N-body simulation. A simulation of a sample model shows that in practice the models are very close to equilibrium, making them ideal for experiments on instabilities in galactic discs. We also present a sequence of models closely resembling the Milky Way mass distribution with 5 exponential scale radii and varying halo mass and radial extent. },

	Abstract = {We present a detailed study of the viewing angles of the LMC disk plane. We find that our viewing direction differs considerably from the commonly accepted values, which has important implications for the structure of the LMC. The discussion is based on an analysis of spatial variations in the apparent magnitude of features in the near-IR color-magnitude diagrams extracted from the Deep Near-Infrared Southern Sky Survey (DENIS) and Two Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS). Sinusoidal brightness variations with a peak-to-peak amplitude of ~0.25 mag are detected as a function of position angle. The same variations are detected for asymptotic giant branch stars (using the mode of their luminosity function) and for red giant branch stars (using the tip of their luminosity function), and these variations are seen consistently in all of the near-IR photometric bands in both DENIS and 2MASS data. The observed spatial brightness variations are naturally interpreted as the result of distance variations because of one side of the LMC plane being closer to us than the opposite side. There is no evidence that any complicating effects, such as possible spatial variations in dust absorption or the age/metallicity of the stellar population, cause large-scale brightness variations in the near-IR at a level that exceeds the formal errors (~0.03 mag). The best-fitting geometric model of an inclined plane yields an inclination angle i=34.7d+/-6.2d and line-of-nodes position angle Θ=122.5d+/-8.3d. The quoted errors are conservative estimates that take into account the possible influence of systematic errors; the formal errors are much smaller, 0.7d and 1.6d, respectively. There is tentative evidence for variations of ~10$\,^{\circ}$ in the viewing angles with distance from the LMC center, suggesting that the LMC disk plane may be warped. Traditional methods to estimate the position angle of the line of nodes have used either the major-axis position angle Θmaj of the spatial distribution of tracers on the sky or the position angle Θmax of the line of maximum gradient in the velocity field, given that for a circular disk Θmaj=Θmax=Θ. The present study does not rely on the assumption of circular symmetry and is considerably more accurate than previous studies of its kind. We find that the actual position angle of the line of nodes differs considerably from both Θmaj and Θmax, for which measurements have fallen in the range 140$\,^{\circ}$-190$\,^{\circ}$. This indicates that the intrinsic shape of the LMC disk is not circular but elliptical. Paper II of this series explores the implications of this result through a detailed study of the shape and structure of the LMC. The inclination angle inferred here is consistent with previous estimates, but this is to some extent a coincidence, given that also for the inclination angle most previous estimates were based on the incorrect assumption of circular symmetry. },

We transform these intermediate-band photometric data to the photometry in the standard UBVRI broad-bands. These M31 GC candidates are selected from the Revised Bologna Catalogue (RBC V.3.5), and most of these candidates do not have any photometric data. Therefore the present photometric data are supplement to RBC V.3.5. We find that 4 out of 61 GCs and GC candidates in RBC V.3.5 do not show any signal on the BATC images at their locations. By linear fit of the distribution in colour-magnitude diagram of blue GCs and GC candidates using the data from RBC V.3.5, and in this study we find the ``blue-tilt'' of blue M31 GCs with a high confidence at 99.95% or 3.47 sigma for the confirmed GCs, and >99.99% or 4.87 sigma for GCs and GC candidates. },

	Abstract = {We have obtained velocity dispersions from Keck high-resolution integrated spectroscopy of ten M31 globular clusters (GCs), including three candidate intermediate-age GCs. We show that these candidates have the same V-band mass-to-light (M/L_V) ratios as the other GCs, implying that they are likely to be old. We also find a trend of derived velocity dispersion with wavelength, but cannot distinguish between a systematic error and a physical effect. Our new measurements are combined with photometric and spectroscopic data from the literature in a reanalysis of all M31 GC M/L_V values. In a combined sample of 27 GCs, we show that the metal-rich GCs have *lower* M/L_V than the metal-poor GCs, in conflict with predictions from stellar population models. Fragmentary data for other galaxies support this observation. The M31 GC fundamental plane is extremely tight, and we follow up an earlier suggestion by Djorgovski to show that the fundamental plane can be used to estimate accurate distances (potentially 10% or better). },

	Abstract = {A new method of statistical analysis based on Bayes' theorem is devised and used directly to yield confidence intervals for the mass of the Galaxy once the eccentricity distribution of its satellites are specified. If the satellites have an isotropic velocity distribution, then the Galactic mass is less than about 5.2 x 10 to the 11th solar masses at the 95 percent confidence level. If the Galaxy is modeled as an infinite halo with constant circular speed v(c) and the velocities are isotropic, then the analysis predicts v(c) of less than about 165 km/s at the 95 percent confidence level. If the satellite orbits are more radial, then the estimates are lower. These results suggest that the Galaxy's massive dark halo extends to less than about 50 kpc from the Galactic center. },

@article{Klypin:2002,
	Abstract = {We apply standard disk formation theory with adiabatic contraction within cuspy halo models predicted by the standard cold dark matter (ΛCDM) cosmology. The resulting models are confronted with the broad range of observational data available for the Milky Way and M31 galaxies. We find that there is a narrow range of parameters that can satisfy the observational constraints, but within this range, the models score remarkably well. Our favored models have virial masses of 1012 and 1.6×1012 Msolar for the Galaxy and for M31, respectively, average spin parameters λ~0.03-0.05, and concentrations Cvir=10-17, typical for halos of this mass in the standard ΛCDM cosmology. The models require neither dark matter modifications nor flat cores to fit the observational data. We explore two types of models, with and without the exchange of angular momentum between the dark matter and the baryons. The models without exchange give reasonable rotation curves, fulfill constraints in the solar neighborhood, and satisfy constraints at larger radii, but they may be problematic for fast rotating central bars. We explore models in which the baryons experience additional contraction due to loss of angular momentum to the surrounding dark matter. These models produce similar global properties, but the dark matter is only a 25% of the total mass in the central 3 kpc region, allowing a fast rotating bar to persist. According to preliminary calculations, our model galaxies probably have sufficient baryonic mass in the central ~3.5 kpc to reproduce recent observational values of the optical depth to microlensing events toward the Galactic center. Our dynamical models unequivocally require that about 50% of all the gas inside the virial radius must not be in the disk or in the bulge, a result that is obtained naturally in standard semianalytic models. Assuming that the Milky Way is ``typical,'' we investigate whether the range of virial masses allowed by our dynamical models is compatible with constraints from the galaxy luminosity function. We find that if the Milky Way has a luminosity MK=-24.0, then these constraints are satisfied, but if it is more luminous (as expected if it lies on the Tully-Fisher relation), then the predicted space density is larger than the observed space density of galaxies of the corresponding luminosity by a factor of 1.5-2. We conclude that observed rotation curves and dynamical properties of ``normal'' spiral galaxies appear to be consistent with standard ΛCDM. },

The mass estimate is accompanied by considerable uncertainty caused by the small size of the data set; for example, the upper bound on the total mass is ~24×1011 Msolar, while the lower bound is ~3×1011 Msolar. These values are less than the most recent estimates of the most likely mass of the Milky Way halo. Bearing in mind all the uncertainties, a fair conclusion is that the M31 halo is roughly as massive as that of the Milky Way halo. There is no dynamical evidence for the widely held belief that M31 is more massive-it may even be less massive. Based in part on data collected at W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

@article{van-der-Marel:2002,
	Abstract = {We formulate a new and coherent understanding of the structure and dynamics of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and its orbit around and interaction with the Milky Way. Much of our understanding of these issues hinges on studies of the LMC line-of-sight kinematics. The observed velocity field includes contributions from the LMC rotation curve V(R'), the LMC transverse velocity vector vt, and the rate of inclination change di/dt. All previous studies have assumed di/dt=0. We show that this is incorrect and that, combined with uncertainties in vt, this has led to incorrect estimates of many important structural parameters of the LMC. We derive general expressions for the velocity field that we fit to kinematic data for 1041 carbon stars. We calculate vt by compiling and improving LMC proper-motion measurements from the literature, and we show that for known vt, all other model parameters are uniquely determined by the data. The position angle of the line of nodes is Θ=129.9d+/-6.0d, consistent with the value determined geometrically by van der Marel & Cioni in 2001. The rate of inclination change is di/dt=-0.37+/-0.22 mas yr-1=-103$\,^{\circ}$+/-61$\,^{\circ}$ Gyr-1. This is similar in magnitude to predictions from N-body simulations by M. Weinberg, which predict LMC disk precession and nutation due to Milky Way tidal torques. The LMC rotation curve V(R') has amplitude 49.8+/-15.9 km s-1. This is 40% lower than what has previously (and incorrectly) been inferred from studies of H I, carbon stars, and other tracers. The line-of-sight velocity dispersion has an average value σ=20.2+/-0.5 km s-1, with little variation as a function of radius. The dynamical center of the carbon stars is consistent with the center of the bar and the center of the outer isophotes, but it is offset by 1.2d+/-0.6d from the kinematic center of the H I. The enclosed mass inside the last data point is MLMC(8.9 kpc)=(8.7+/-4.3)×109 Msolar, more than half of which is due to a dark halo.

The LMC has a considerable vertical thickness; its V/σ=2.9+/-0.9 is less than the value for the Milky Way's thick disk (V/σ~3.9). Simple arguments for models stratified on spheroids indicate that the (out of plane) axial ratio could be ~0.3 or larger. Isothermal disk models for the observed velocity dispersion profile confirm the finding of Alves & Nelson that the scale height must increase with radius. A substantial thickness to the LMC disk is consistent with the simulations of Weinberg, which predict LMC disk thickening due to Milky Way tidal forces. These affect LMC structure even inside the LMC's tidal radius, which we calculate to be rt=15.0+/-4.5 kpc (i.e., 17.1d+/-5.1d). The new insights into LMC structure need not significantly alter existing predictions for the LMC's self-lensing optical depth, which to lowest order depends only on σ. The compiled proper-motion data imply an LMC transverse velocity vt=406 km s-1 in the direction of position angle 78.7d (with errors of ~40 km s-1 in each coordinate). This can be combined with the observed systemic line-of-sight velocity, vsys=262.2+/-3.4 km s-1, to calculate the LMC velocity in the Galactocentric rest frame. This yields vLMC=293+/-39 km s-1, with radial and tangential components vLMC,rad=84+/-7 km s-1 and vLMC,tan=281+/-41 km s-1, respectively. This is consistent with the range of velocities that has been predicted by models for the Magellanic Stream. The implied orbit of the LMC has an apocenter-to-pericenter distance ratio ~2.5:1, a perigalactic distance ~45 kpc, and a present orbital period around the Milky Way of ~1.5 Gyr. The constraint that the LMC is bound to the Milky Way provides a robust limit on the minimum mass and extent of the Milky Way dark halo: MMW>=4.3×1011 Msolar and rh>=39 kpc (68.3% confidence). Finally, we present predictions for the LMC proper-motion velocity field, and we discuss how measurements of this may lead to kinematic distance estimates for the LMC. },

@article{vdm,
	Abstract = {We present several different statistical methods to determine the transverse velocity vector of M31. The underlying assumptions are that the M31 satellites on average follow the motion of M31 through space and that the galaxies in the outer parts of the Local Group on average follow the motion of the Local Group barycenter through space. We apply the methods to the line-of-sight velocities of 17 M31 satellites, to the proper motions of the two satellites M33 and IC 10, and to the line-of-sight velocities of five galaxies near the Local Group turnaround radius, respectively. This yields four independent but mutually consistent determinations of the heliocentric M31 transverse velocities in the west and north directions, with weighted averages <vW>=-78+/-41 km s-1 and <vN>=-38+/-34 km s-1. The uncertainties correspond to proper motions of ~10 μas yr-1, which will be difficult to verify observationally within the next decade. The galactocentric tangential velocity of M31 is 42 km s-1, with 1 σ confidence interval Vtan<=56 km s-1. The implied M31-Milky Way orbit is bound if the total Local Group mass M exceeds 1.72+0.26-0.25×1012 Msolar. If the orbit is indeed bound, then the timing argument combined with the known age of the universe implies that M=5.58+0.85-0.72×1012 Msolar. This is on the high end of the allowed mass range suggested by cosmologically motivated models for the individual structure and dynamics of M31 and the Milky Way, respectively. It is therefore possible that the timing mass is an overestimate of the true mass, especially if one takes into account recent results from the Millenium Simulation that show that there is also a theoretical uncertainty of 41% (Gaussian dispersion) in timing mass estimates. The M31 transverse velocity implies that M33 is in a tightly bound orbit around M31. This may have led to some tidal deformation of M33. It will be worthwhile to search for observational evidence of this. },

	Abstract = {Proper motions for several Milky Way dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies have been determined using both ground- and space-based imaging. These measurements require long baselines and repeat observations, and typical errors are of order 10 mas century-1. In this Letter, we utilize the effect of ``perspective rotation'' to show that the systematic proper motion of some dSphs can be determined to a similar precision using only stellar line-of-sight velocities. We show that including the effects of small intrinsic rotation in dSphs increases the proper motion errors by about a factor of 2. We provide error projections for future data sets and show that proposed 30 m class telescopes will measure the proper motion of a few dSphs with mas century-1 precision. },

@article{Wilkinson:1999,
	Abstract = {A simple model for the Milky Way halo is presented. It has a flat rotation curve in the inner regions, but the density falls off sharply beyond an outer edge. This truncated, flat rotation curve (TF) model possesses a rich family of simple distribution functions which vary in velocity anisotropy. The model is used to estimate the total mass of the Milky Way halo using the latest data on the motions of satellite galaxies and globular clusters at Galactocentric radii greater than 20kpc. This comprises a data set of 27 objects with known distances and radial velocities, of which six also possess measured proper motions. Unlike earlier investigations, we find entirely consistent maximum likelihood solutions unaffected by the presence or absence of Leo I, provided both radial and proper motion data are used. The availability of the proper motion data for the satellites is crucial as, without them, the mass estimates with and without Leo I are inconsistent at the 99per cent confidence level. All these results are derived from models in which the velocity normalization of the halo potential is taken as ~220kms-1. A detailed analysis of the uncertainties in our estimate is presented, including the effects of the small data set, possible incompleteness or correlations in the satellite galaxy sample and the measurement errors. The most serious uncertainties come from the size of the data set, which may cause a systematic underestimate by a factor of 2, and the measurement errors, which cause a scatter in the mass of the order of a factor of 2. We conclude that the total mass of the halo is ~1.9-1.7+3.6x1012Msolar, while the mass within 50kpc is ~5.4-3.6+0.2x1011Msolar. In the near future, ground-based radial velocity surveys of samples of blue horizontal branch (BHB) stars are a valuable way to augment the sparse data set. A data set of ~200 radial velocities of BHB stars will reduce the uncertainty in the mass estimate to ~20per cent. In the coming decade, microarcsecond astrometry will be possible with the Space Interferometry Mission (SIM) and the Global Astrometry Interferometer for Astrophysics (GAIA) satellites. For example, GAIA can provide the proper motions of the distant dwarfs like Leo I to within +/-15kms-1 and the nearer dwarfs like Ursa Minor to within +/-1kms-1. This will also allow the total mass of the Milky Way to be found to ~20per cent. SIM and GAIA will also provide an accurate estimate of the velocity normalization of the halo potential at large radii. },

	Abstract = {With the ultimate aim of distinguishing between various models describing the formation of galaxy halos (e.g., radial or multiphase collapse and random mergers), we have completed a spectroscopic study of the globular cluster system of M31. We present the results of deep intermediate-resolution fiber-optic spectroscopy of several hundred of the M31 globular clusters using the Wide Field Fibre Optic Spectrograph at the William Herschel Telescope in La Palma, Canary Islands. These observations have yielded precise radial velocities (+/-12 km s-1) and metallicities (+/-0.26 dex) for over 200 members of the M31 globular cluster population out to a radius of 1.5d from the galaxy center. Many of these clusters have no previous published radial velocity or [Fe/H] estimates, and the remainder typically represent significant improvements over earlier determinations. We present analyses of the spatial, kinematic, and metal abundance properties of the M31 globular clusters. We find that the abundance distribution of the cluster system is consistent with a bimodal distribution with peaks at [Fe/H]~-1.4 and -0.5. The metal-rich clusters demonstrate a centrally concentrated spatial distribution with a high rotation amplitude, although this population does not appear significantly flattened and is consistent with a bulge population. The metal-poor clusters tend to be less spatially concentrated and are also found to have a strong rotation signature. },

	Abstract = {We have explored the hypothesis that the total mass-ratio of the two main galaxies of the Local Group: Andromeda Galaxy(M31) and the Milky Way (MW) can be constrained measuring the tidal force induced by the surrounding mass distribution, M31 included, on the MW. We argue that the total mass-ratio between the two groups can be approximated, at least qualitatively, finding the tidal radius where the internal binding force of the MW balances the external tidal force acting on it. Since M31 is the massive tidal perturber of the local environment, we have used a wide range of M31 to MW mass-ratio combinations to compute the corresponding tidal radii. Of them, only few match the distance of the zero-tidal shell i.e. the shell identified observationally by the outermost dwarf galaxies which do not show any sign of tidal effects. This is the key to constrain the best mass-ratio interval of the two galaxies. Our results favour a solution where the mass-ratio ranges from 2 to 3 implying a massive predominance of M31. },

	Abstract = {We present far-ultraviolet photometry obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope of the low-mass X-ray binary 4U 0513-40 in the globular cluster NGC 1851. Our observations reveal a clear, roughly sinusoidal periodic signal with $P \simeq 17$ min and amplitude 3%-10%. The signal appears fully coherent and can be modelled as a simple reprocessing effect associated with the changing projected area presented by the irradiated face of a white dwarf donor star in the system. All of these properties suggest that the signal we have detected is orbital in nature, thus confirming 4U 0513-40 as an ultracompact X-ray binary (UCXB). All four confirmed UCXBs in globular clusters have orbital periods below 30 minutes, whereas almost all UCXBs in the Galactic field have orbital periods longer than this. This suggests that the dynamical formation processes dominate UCXB production in clusters, producing a different orbital period distribution than observed among field UCXBs. Based on the likely system parameters, we show that 4U 0513-40 should be a strong gravitational wave source and may be detectable by LISA over the course of a multi-year mission. },

@article{Cote:1998,
	Abstract = {We examine the formation of giant elliptical galaxies using their globular cluster (GC) systems as probes of their evolutionary history. The bimodal distributions of GC metallicities in such galaxies are often cited as evidence for the formation of giant elliptical galaxies through mergers involving gas-rich spirals, with the metal-rich GCs forming during the merger process. We explore an alternative possibility: that these metal-rich clusters represent the galaxy's intrinsic GC population and the metal-poor component of the observed GC metallicity distribution arises from the capture of GCs from other galaxies, either through mergers or through tidal stripping. Starting with plausible assumptions for the luminosity function of galaxies in the host cluster and for the dependence of GC metallicity on parent galaxy luminosity, we show using Monte Carlo simulations that the growth of a preexisting seed galaxy through mergers and tidal stripping is accompanied naturally by the capture of metal-poor GCs whose chemical abundances are similar to those that are observed to surround giant ellipticals. We also investigate the spatial distribution of GCs in isolated galaxies of low and intermediate luminosity and conclude that, at the epoch of formation, the GC systems of such galaxies are likely to have been more spatially extended than their constituent stars. Thus, the capture of GCs through tidal stripping, unlike mergers, does not necessarily conserve GC specific frequency. Comparisons of model GC metallicity distributions and specific frequencies to those observed for the well-studied galaxies NGC 4472 (=M49) and NGC 4486 (=M87), the two brightest cluster members of the nearby Virgo cluster, show that it is possible to explain their bimodal GC metallicity distributions and discordant specific frequencies without resorting to the formation of new GCs in mergers or by invoking multiple bursts of GC formation. Finally, we discuss the possibility of using the ratio of the numbers of metal-poor to metal-rich GCs in giant elliptical galaxies as a diagnostic of their merger histories. We use this method to derive upper limits on the number of galaxies and total luminosity accreted to date by NGC 4472. },

	Abstract = {We report the first results from deep ACS imaging of 10 classical globular clusters in the far outer regions (15 kpc<~Rp<~100 kpc) of M31. Eight of the clusters, including two of the most remote M31 globular clusters presently known, are described for the first time. Our F606W, F814W color-magnitude diagrams extend ~3 mag below the horizontal branch and clearly demonstrate that the majority of these objects are old (>~10 Gyr), metal-poor clusters. Five have [Fe/H] ~ -2.1, while an additional four have -1.9 <~ [Fe/H] <~ -1.5. The remaining object is more metal-rich, with [Fe/H] ~ -0.70. Several clusters exhibit the second-parameter effect. Using aperture photometry, we estimate integrated luminosities and structural parameters for all clusters. Many, including all four clusters with projected radii greater than 45 kpc, are compact and very luminous, with -8.9 <~ MV <~ -8.3. These four outermost clusters are thus quite unlike their Milky Way counterparts, which are typically diffuse, subluminous (-6.0 <~ MV <~ -4.7), and more metal-rich (-1.8 <~ [Fe/H] <~ -1.3).

Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555. These observations are associated with program 10394. },

In the cluster core, we find that the cluster's SGB exhibits a clear spread in luminosity, with at least two distinct components: a brighter one with a spread that is real but not bimodal, and a second one about 0.05 mag fainter, containing about 10% of the stars. In a less crowded field 6 arcminutes from the center, we find that the MS is broadened much more than can be accounted for by photometric errors, and that this broadening increases at fainter magnitudes. },

	Abstract = {We have used data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 5 to explore the overall structure and substructure of the stellar halo of the Milky Way using ~4 million color-selected main-sequence turnoff stars with 0.2<g-r<0.4 and 18.5<=r<22.5. We fit oblate and triaxial broken power law models to the data, and found a ``best-fit'' oblateness of the stellar halo 0.5<c/a<0.8, and halo stellar masses between galactocentric radii of 1 and 40 kpc of 3.7+/-1.2×108 Msolar. The density profile of the stellar halo is approximately ρ~r-α, where -2>α>-4. Yet, we found that all smooth and symmetric models were very poor fits to the distribution of stellar halo stars because the data exhibit a great deal of spatial substructure. We quantified deviations from a smooth oblate/triaxial model using the rms of the data around the model profile on scales >~100 pc, after accounting for the (known) contribution of Poisson uncertainties. Within the DR5 area of the SDSS, the fractional rms deviation σ/total of the actual stellar distribution from any smooth, parameterized halo model is >~40%: hence, the stellar halo is highly structured. We compared the observations with simulations of galactic stellar halos formed entirely from the accretion of satellites in a cosmological context by analyzing the simulations in the same way as the SDSS data. While the masses, overall profiles, and degree of substructure in the simulated stellar halos show considerable scatter, the properties and degree of substructure in the Milky Way's halo match well the properties of a ``typical'' stellar halo built exclusively out of the debris from disrupted satellite galaxies. Our results therefore point toward a picture in which an important fraction of the stellar halo of the Milky Way has been accreted from satellite galaxies. },

	Abstract = {We have measured the amount of kinematic substructure in the Galactic halo using the final dataset from the Spaghetti project, a pencil-beam high latitude sky survey. Our sample contains 101 photometrically selected and spectroscopically confirmed giants with accurate distance, radial velocity and metallicity information. We have developed a new clustering estimator: the "4distance" measure, which when applied to our dataset leads to the identification of 1 group and 7 pairs of clumped stars. The group, with 6 members, can confidently be matched to tidal debris of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. Two pairs match the properties of known Virgo structures. Using models of the disruption of Sagittarius in Galactic potentials with different degrees of dark halo flattening, we show that this favors a spherical or prolate halo shape, as demonstrated by Newberg et al. (2007) using SDSS data. One additional pair can be linked to older Sagittarius debris. We find that 20% of the stars in the Spaghetti dataset are in substructures. From comparison with random datasets we derive a very conservative lower limit of 10% to the amount of substructure in the halo. However, comparison to numerical simulations shows that our results are also consistent with a halo entirely built up from disrupted satellites, provided the dominating features are relatively broad due to early merging or relatively heavy progenitor satellites. },

@article{Ibata:1995,
	Abstract = {We have discovered a new Galactic satellite galaxy in the constellation of Sagittarius. The Sagittarius dwarf galaxy subtends an angle of ~10 deg on the sky, lies at a distance of 24 kpc and is comparable in size and luminosity to the largest dwarf spheroidal, Fornax. The new galaxy has many features in common with the other eight Galactic dwarf spheroidal systems, including an extended low-density spatial structure, a well-populated red horizontal branch with a blue extension, and a substantial carbon star population. In terms of stellar populations it most closely resembles the Fornax dwarf, having a strong intermediate-age stellar component and evidence of a metallicity spread. Sagittarius is the nearest galaxy known and currently lies only ~16 kpc from the centre of the Milky Way. Isodensity maps show it to be markedly elongated along a direction pointing towards the Galactic Centre, and suggest that it has been tidally distorted. The close proximity to the Galactic Centre, the morphological appearance and the radial velocity of 140 km s^-1 indicate that this system must have undergone at most very few close orbital encounters with the Milky Way. It is currently undergoing strong tidal disruption prior to being integrated into the Galaxy. We find that at least some of the four globular clusters, M54, Arp 2, Ter 7 and Ter 8, are associated with the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, and will probably share the fate of their progenitor. The Sagittarius dwarf galaxy was found serendipitously using a combination of UK Schmidt Telescope sky survey plates, the APM automatic plate measuring facility and the Anglo-Australian Telescope multifibre spectrograph, AUTOFIB. },

@article{Cote:1999,
	Abstract = {The High-Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES) on the Keck I telescope has been used to measure the first radial velocities for stars belonging to 11 heavily reddened globular clusters in the direction of the inner Galaxy. The sample consists of the clusters Terzan 3, NGC 6256, IC 1257, NGC 6380 (=Ton 1), Ton 2 (=Pismis 26), Djorg 1, NGC 6540 (=Djorg 3), IC 1276 (=Pal 7), Terzan 12, NGC 6749, and Pal 10. Candidate cluster members were selected from a combination of previously published color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) and new instrumental CMDs obtained with the Palomar 1.5 m telescope. The systemic velocities of Djorg 1 and Pal 10 should be considered provisional, since velocities are available for only two stars. For the remaining nine clusters, we have measured radial velocities for three to nine member stars. Using our HIRES spectra, we estimate metallicities of [Fe/H]~=-0.75 for both Terzan 3 and IC 1276, two clusters lacking previous metallicity estimates. The question of kinematic substructuring among the Galactic globular clusters is investigated using an updated catalog of globular cluster distances, metallicities, and velocities. It is found that the population of metal-rich globular clusters shows significant rotation at all Galactocentric radii. For the metal-rich clusters within 4 kpc of the Galactic center, the measured rotation velocity and line-of-sight velocity dispersion are similar to those of bulge field stars. We investigate claims that the metal-rich clusters are associated with the central Galactic bar by comparing the kinematics of the innermost clusters to that of the atomic hydrogen in the inner Galaxy. The longitude-velocity diagram of both metal-rich and metal-poor clusters bears a remarkable similarity to that of the gas, including the same noncircular motions that have traditionally been interpreted as evidence for a Galactic bar, or, alternatively, a nonaxisymmetric bulge. However, uncertainties in the existing three-dimensional Galactocentric positions for most of the clusters do not yet allow an unambiguous discrimination between the competing scenarios of membership in a rigidly rotating bar or in a bulge that is an oblate isotropic rotator. We conclude that the majority of metal-rich clusters within the central ~4 kpc of the Galaxy are probably associated with the bulge/bar, and not the thick disk. },

Second-parameter effects are linked to cluster kinematics, and hence to the history of proto-Galactic collapse.

On the basis of kinematics, spatial distribution, and metallicity, we argue that these clusters may be associated with the galactic bulge (as concluded by Frenk & White 1982) rather than with the thick disk. On the basis of the available ages for some of these clusters, it is argued that the glactic bulge formed after the halo. Different formation senarios of the galaxy are examined, and it is concluded that dissapation played a major role in the inner 3 kpc. },

@article{Palma:2002,
	Abstract = {In numerous studies of the outer Galactic halo some evidence for accretion has been found. If the outer halo did form in part or wholly through merger events, we might expect to find coherent streams of stars and globular clusters following orbits similar to those of their parent objects, which are assumed to be present or former Milky Way dwarf satellite galaxies. We present a study of this phenomenon by assessing the likelihood of potential descendant ``dynamical families'' in the outer halo. We conduct two analyses: one that involves a statistical analysis of the spatial distribution of all known Galactic dwarf satellite galaxies (DSGs) and globular clusters, and a second, more specific analysis of those globular clusters and DSGs for which full phase space dynamical data exist. In both cases our methodology is appropriate only to members of descendant dynamical families that retain nearly aligned orbital poles today. Since the Sagittarius dwarf (Sgr) is considered a paradigm for the type of merger/tidal interaction event for which we are searching, we also undertake a case study of the Sgr system and identify several globular clusters that may be members of its extended dynamical family. In our first analysis, the distribution of possible orbital poles for the entire sample of outer (Rgc>8 kpc) halo globular clusters is tested for statistically significant associations among globular clusters and DSGs. Our methodology for identifying possible associations is similar to that used by Lynden-Bell & Lynden-Bell, but we put the associations on a more statistical foundation. Moreover, we study the degree of possible dynamical clustering among various interesting ensembles of globular clusters and satellite galaxies. Among the ensembles studied, we find the globular cluster subpopulation with the highest statistical likelihood of association with one or more of the Galactic DSGs to be the distant, outer halo (Rgc>25 kpc), second-parameter globular clusters. The results of our orbital pole analysis are supported by the great circle cell count methodology of Johnston, Hernquist, & Bolte. The space motions of the clusters Pal 4, NGC 6229, NGC 7006, and Pyxis are predicted to be among those most likely to show the clusters to be following stream orbits, since these clusters are responsible for the majority of the statistical significance of the association between outer halo, second-parameter globular clusters and the Milky Way DSGs. In our second analysis, we study the orbits of the 41 globular clusters and six Milky Way-bound DSGs having measured proper motions to look for objects with both coplanar orbits and similar angular momenta. Unfortunately, the majority of globular clusters with measured proper motions are inner halo clusters that are less likely to retain memory of their original orbit. Although four potential globular cluster/DSG associations are found, we believe three of these associations involving inner halo clusters to be coincidental. While the present sample of objects with complete dynamical data is small and does not include many of the globular clusters that are more likely to have been captured by the Milky Way, the methodology we adopt will become increasingly powerful as more proper motions are measured for distant Galactic satellites and globular clusters, and especially as results from the Space Interferometry Mission (SIM) become available. },

	Abstract = {Distance moduli for 111 globular clusters are presented which were obtained from color-magnitude diagrams or on the basis of horizontal-branch magnitudes, 25 brightest cluster stars, photographic measurements of RR Lyrae variables, cluster luminosities, or the degree of visual resolution of cluster stars. The space coordinates of the clusters are calculated, and the distance information is applied to determine the true centroid of the cluster system as well as the distance to the galactic center. A value of 8.5 kpc is adopted for the latter, uncertainties in this determination are evaluated, and the total number of globular clusters in the Galaxy is estimated to be about 170. The space distribution of metallicity groups among the clusters is investigated along with the ellipticity of the cluster system, the three-dimensional density distribution in the system, and the relation between this distribution and metallicity. The relation of the outermost halo objects to the normal cluster system is briefly discussed, and a rough estimate of the total halo mass is obtained by assuming that the mass distribution of Population II halo stars is similar to the space distribution of the globular clusters. },

	Abstract = {The spatial distributions, kinematics, and metallicities of 121 globular clusters are examined for evidence of distinct subpopulations in the cluster system. Clusters more metal-poor than (Fe/H) = -0.8 constitute the familiar halo population, while clusters more metal-rich than (Fe/H) = -0.8 have the properties of a disk system. There is a shallow but significant metallicity gradient with R in the halo population. The central concentrations and ellipticities of the halo and disk clusters are similar, while the latter are more evenly distributed in luminosity than the former. Excellent agreement is found between the properties of globular clusters and those of RR Lyrae variables and subdwarfs when these are also divided by metallicity at (Fe/H) = -0.8, which suggests that clusters are good tracers of the halo and old disk stellar populations. The scale height of the disk clusters appears to be about 500 pc, and it is argued that disk clusters are relics of a transient, thick-disk phase in the evolution of the Galaxy. },

	Abstract = {Lynden-Bell first demonstrated that the satellites of the Milky Way appear situated along two great 'streams' in the sky: the 'Magellanic stream' and the 'Fornax-Leo-Sculptor (FLS) stream.' Further exploration of the three-dimensional distribution of Galactic satellites reveals that the recently discovered Sextans and Phoenix dwarf spheroidal galaxies also lie near the plane defined by the FLS galaxies, and therefore strengthens the evidence in favor of the FLS stream. Moreover, a specific group of globular clusters -- those exhibiting the reddest horizontal branches (HBs) among those identified as 'young halo' by Zinn -- appear to populate the FLS stream. As previously demonstrated by Zinn, the spatial distribution of old halo globulars appears to be flattened toward the Galactic plane, and therefore the old halo clusters are typically anti-correlated to the nearly orthogonal FLS stream. A scenario is postulated wherein the Galactic satellites of the FLS stream and the red HB, young halo globular clusters share a common origin in the accretion of a formerly larger, parent satellite galaxy or Searle & Zinn 'fragment.'},

	Abstract = {Twelve of the 21 globular clusters and dwarf spheroidal galaxies lying between 25 and 250 kpc from the Galaxy lie within a narrow zone not more than 6 deg from a great circle, as seen from the Galactic center. Although this planar distribution is inclined by 35 deg to the Magellanic Stream, it can be shown that both may originate in a single encounter disrupting the outer parts of a low-mass 'victim'. Color-magnitude investigations and RR Lyrae variables of the stellar systems, as well as composition differences between the Magellanic Stream and the planar distribution, point to a considerable age for the major portion of stellar debris, placing the more violent disruptive episode earlier than the current perigalactic pass of the Magellanic Clouds. Given that the Stream itself, as well as the young stellar content of the Wing of the SMC, point to a recent disruptive event, at least two disruptive encounters must have occurred. Computer simulation, following methods developed by Toomre, were used to generate a family of models for the formation of the Magellanic Stream that broadly match both the spatial and the velocity distributions of both the gaseous and the stellar components. Agreement in the scaling of velocity is obtained by deepening the Galactic potential with a massive halo, consistent with the formulations of Ostriker et al. (1974) and Einasto et al. (1974).},

	Abstract = {This letter presents the analysis of candidate qLMXBs observed during a short Chandra/ACIS observation of the globular cluster (GC) NGC 6304. Two out of the three candidate qLMXBs of this cluster, XMMU 171433-292747 and XMMU 171421-292917, lie within the field of view. This permits comparison with the discovery observation of these sources. The one in the GC core -- XMMU 171433-292747 -- is spatially resolved into two separate X-ray sources, one of which is consistent with a pure H-atmosphere qLMXB, and the other is an X-ray power-law spectrum source. These two spectral components separately account for those observed from XMMU 171433-292747 in its discovery observation. We find that the observed flux and spectral parameters of the H-atmosphere spectral components are consistent with the previous observation, as expected from a qLMXB powered by deep crustal heating. XMMU 171421-292917 also has neutron star atmosphere spectral parameters consistent with those in the XMM-Newton observation and the observed flux has decreased by a factor 0.54^{+0.30}_{-0.24}. },

	Abstract = {We present a spectroscopic survey of candidate red giant branch stars in the extended star cluster, EC4, discovered in the halo of M31 from our CFHT/MegaCam survey, overlapping the tidal streams, Stream Cp and Stream Cr. These observations used the DEep Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph (DEIMOS) mounted on the Keck II telescope to obtain spectra around the CaII triplet region with ~1.3 Angstroms resolution. Six stars lying on the red giant branch within 2 core-radii of the centre of EC4 are found to have an average vr=-287.9^{+1.9}_{-2.4}km/s and velocity dispersion of 2.7^{+4.2}_{-2.7}km/s, taking instrumental errors into account. The resulting mass-to-light ratio for EC4 is M/L=6.7^{+15}_{-6.7}Msun/Lsun, a value that is consistent with a globular cluster within the 1 sigma errors we derive. From the summed spectra of our member stars, we find EC4 to be metal-poor, with [Fe/H]=-1.6+/-0.15. We discuss several formation and evolution scenarios which could account for our kinematic and metallicity constraints on EC4, and conclude that EC4 is most comparable with an extended globular cluster. We also compare the kinematics and metallicity of EC4 with Stream Cp and Stream Cr, and find that EC4 bears a striking resemblance to Stream Cp in terms of velocity, and that the two structures are identical in terms of both their spectroscopic and photometric metallicities. From this we conclude that EC4 is likely related to Stream Cp.},

	Abstract = {We will determine the kinematic behaviour of ∼170 previously unstudied globular clusters (GCs) and GC 
candidates in the outer halo of M31, and explore the halo kinematics of that nearby galaxy to unprecedented

(the former of which has been much studied), and determine the distinct kinematical signature of the latter. 
Much-improved global mass estimates will be derived for the dark matter and luminous halo of M31, and, 
with reference to theoretical models and simulations, we will explore any kinematic evidence indicative of 
streaming and recent accretion events. 
To accomplish these important objectives, we will use the MOS-ARGUS instrument at CFHT in IFU mode 
(as a ``visitor'' instrument, through pre-arrangement with the CFHT Director). This instrument is nothing 
short of ideal for the proposed survey, which will yield an outer-halo sample of precision dynamical tracers in 
M31 at least an order of magnitude larger than currently available.},

@article{Caldwell:2009,
	Abstract = {We present an updated catalog of 1300 objects in the field of M31, including 670 likely star clusters of various types, the rest being stars or background galaxies once thought to be clusters. The coordinates in the catalog are accurate to 0farcs2, and are based on images from the Local Group Survey (LGS) or from the Digitized Sky Survey (DSS). Archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images and the LGS were inspected to confirm cluster classifications where possible, but most of the classifications are based on spectra taken of ~1000 objects with the Hectospec fiber positioner and spectrograph on the 6.5 m MMT. The spectra and images of young clusters are analyzed in detail in this paper; analysis of older clusters will appear in a later paper. Ages and reddenings of 140 young clusters are derived by comparing the observed spectra with model spectra. Seven of these clusters also have ages derived from HST color-magnitude diagrams (two of which we present here); these agree well with the spectroscopically determined ages. Combining new V-band photometry with the M/L values that correspond to the derived cluster ages, we derive masses for the young clusters, finding them to have masses as great as 105 with a median of 104 M sun, and a median age of 0.25 Gyr. In comparison, therefore, Milky Way (MW) open clusters have the lowest median mass, the MW and M31 globulars the highest, and the LMC young massive clusters and the M31 young clusters are in between. The young clusters in M31 show a range of structures. Most have the low concentration typical of MW open clusters, but there are a few which have high concentrations. We expect that most of these young clusters will be disrupted in the next Gyr or so; however, some of the more massive and concentrated of the young clusters will likely survive for longer. The spatial distribution of the young clusters is well correlated with the star-forming regions as mapped out by mid-IR emission. A kinematic analysis likewise confirms the spatial association of the young clusters with the star-forming young disk in M31. },

	Abstract = {We use data from the Isaac Newton Telescope Wide-Field Camera survey of M31 to determine the surface brightness profile of M31 along the southeast minor axis. We combine surface photometry and faint red giant branch star counts to trace the profile from the innermost regions out to a projected radius of 4$\,^{\circ}$ (~55 kpc), where μV~32 mag arcsec-2 this is the first time the M31 minor-axis profile has been mapped over such a large radial distance using a single data set. We confirm the finding by Pritchet & van den Bergh that the minor-axis profile can be described by a single de Vaucouleurs law out to a projected radius of 1.4d or ~20 kpc. Beyond this, the surface brightness profile flattens considerably and is consistent with either a power law of index about -2.3 or an exponential of scale length 14 kpc. The fraction of the total M31 luminosity contained in this component is ~2.5%. While it is tempting to associate this outer component with a true Population II halo in M31, we find that the mean color of the stellar population remains roughly constant at V-i~1.6 from 0.5d to 3.5d along the minor axis. This result suggests that the same metal-rich stellar population dominates both structural components.

	Abstract = {A method of abundance determination based on reddening-independent properties of low-resolution spectral scans is described and applied to 177 red giants in 19 globular clusters, most of which are at galactocentric distances in excess of 8 kpc. The general properties of the halo-cluster system inferred from the abundance results are examined. It is found that the distribution over abundance of the halo globular clusters is independent of galactocentric distance for distances exceeding 8 kpc and that the clusters exhibit differences in the morphology of their color-magnitude diagrams that are uncorrelated with metal abundance. The characteristics of the system of halo clusters are compared with implications of some simple conceptual schemes for the formation of the Galaxy. It is suggested that the halo clusters originated within transient protogalactic fragments that gradually lost gas while undergoing chemical evolution and continued to fall into the Galaxy after the collapse of its central regions had been completed.},

	Abstract = {Globular clusters in the outer halo (Rgc > 15kpc) are found to be systematically fainter than those at smaller Galactocentric distances. Within the outer halo the compact clusters with half-light radii Rh < 10pc are only found at Rgc < 40kpc, while on the other hand the larger clusters with Rh > 10pc are encountered at all Galactocentric distances. Among the compact clusters with Rh < 10pc that have Rgc > 15kpc, there are two objects with surprisingly high metallicities. One of these is Terzan 7, which is a companion of the Sagittarius dwarf. The other is Palomar 1. The data on these two objects suggests that they might have had similar evolutionary histories. It is also noted that, with one exception, luminous globular clusters in the outer halo are all compact whereas faint ones may have any radius. This also holds for globular clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud, Small Magellanic Cloud and Fornax dwarf. The lone exception is the large luminous globular NGC 2419. Possibly this object is not a normal globular cluster, but the stripped core of a former dwarf spheroidal. In this respect it may resemble ω Centauri.},

@article{Mackey:2005,
	Abstract = {In this paper we compare the properties of three subsystems of Galactic globular clusters, which are defined according to metallicity and horizontal branch morphology. We specifically focus on cluster luminosities, structures, surface brightnesses and ellipticities. It is shown that the so-called `young' halo (YH) clusters, which are thought to have formed in external satellite galaxies, exhibit characteristics which are clearly distinct from those of the `old' halo (OH) and bulge/disc (BD) clusters, the majority of which are believed to be Galactic natives. The properties of the YH objects are, in many respects, similar to those of clusters belonging to a number of present-day satellite dwarf galaxies. The OH and BD populations have apparently been strongly modified by destructive tidal forces and shocks in the inner Galaxy. By comparing the properties of the three cluster subsystems, we estimate that the present population of native Galactic clusters may only represent approximately two-thirds of the original population. Several clusters with low surface brightnesses are observed to be highly flattened. We briefly speculate on the possibility that this ellipticity reflects the intrinsic flattening of dark matter mini-haloes in which these optically dim clusters might be embedded. Finally, we examine the distribution of clusters on the size (logRh) versus luminosity (MV) plane. Three objects are seen to fall well above the sharp upper envelope of the main distribution of clusters on the size-luminosity plane: ω Centauri, M54 and NGC 2419. All three of these objects have previously, and independently, been suggested to be the stripped cores of former dwarf galaxies. This suspicion is strengthened by the additional observation that the massive cluster G1 in M31 plus a number of the most luminous clusters in NGC 5128 also fall in the same region of the logRh versus MV plane. All of the latter objects have previously been suggested as the stripped cores of now defunct dwarf galaxies.},

	Abstract = {The ACS Survey of Galactic Globular Clusters, an HST Treasury Project, will deliver high-quality, homogeneous photometry of 65 globular clusters. This paper introduces a new collection of stellar evolution tracks and isochrones suitable for analyzing the ACS survey data. Stellar evolution models were computed at [Fe/H]=-2.5, -2.0, -1.5, -1.0, -0.5, and 0; [α/Fe]=-0.2, 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8; and three initial He abundances for masses from 0.1 to 1.8 Msolar and ages from 2 to 15 Gyr. Each isochrone spans a wide range in luminosity, from MV~14 up to the tip of the red giant branch. These are complemented by a set of He-burning tracks that extend from the zero-age horizontal branch to the onset of thermal pulsations on the asymptotic giant branch. In addition, a set of computer programs are provided that make it possible to interpolate the isochrones in [Fe/H], generate luminosity functions from the isochrones, and create synthetic horizontal-branch models. The tracks and isochrones have been converted to the observational plane with two different color-Teff transformations, one synthetic and one semiempirical, in ground-based B, V, and I, and F606W and F814W for both ACS WFC and WFPC2 systems. All models and programs presented in this paper are available at the Dartmouth Stellar Evolution Database and the Multimission Archive at the Space Telescope Science Institute.

	Abstract = {Globular cluster (GC) systems have now been studied in galaxies ranging from dwarfs to giants and spanning the full Hubble sequence of morphological types. Imaging and spectroscopy with the Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based telescopes have together established that most galaxies have bimodal color distributions that reflect two subpopulations of old GCs: metal-poor and metal-rich. The characteristics of both subpopulations are correlated with those of their parent galaxies. We argue that metal-poor GCs formed in low-mass dark matter halos in the early universe and that their properties reflect biased galaxy assembly. The metal-rich GCs were born in the subsequent dissipational buildup of their parent galaxies and their ages and abundances indicate that most massive early-type galaxies formed the bulk of their stars at early times. Detailed studies of both subpopulations offer some of the strongest constraints on hierarchical galaxy formation that can be obtained in the near-field.},

A model is chosen that provides an excellent fit to the metallicity distribution of stars in the Geneva-Copenhagen survey (GCS) of the solar neighbourhood, and a good fit to the local Hess diagram. The model provides a good fit to the distribution of GCS stars in the age-metallicity plane although this plane was not used in the fitting process. Although this model's star-formation rate is monotonic declining, its disc naturally splits into an alpha-enhanced thick disc and a normal thin disc. In particular the model's distribution of stars in the ([O/Fe],[Fe/H]) plane resembles that of Galactic stars in displaying a ridge line for each disc. The thin-disc's ridge line is entirely due to stellar migration and there is the characteristic variation of stellar angular momentum along it that has been noted by Haywood in survey data. Radial mixing of stellar populations with high sigma_z from inner regions of the disc to the solar neighbourhood provides a natural explanation of why measurements yield a steeper increase of sigma_z with age than predicted by theory. The metallicity gradient in the ISM is predicted to be steeper than in earlier models, but appears to be in good agreement with data for both our Galaxy and external galaxies. The models are inconsistent with a cutoff in the star-formation rate at low gas surface densities. The absolute magnitude of the disc is given as a function of time in several photometric bands, and radial colour profiles are plotted for representative times.},

We present details about the selection criteria, which were based both on morphological and photometrical features. The extracted sample of stellar clusters shows the presence of two cluster populations, a blue cluster group (young) with 560 objects, and a red cluster group (old) with 120 objects. The young group lacks clusters more massive than 10000 solar masses, that are present in large numbers in its neighbor M82. The luminosity distribution function of the young group follows a power-law distribution with an index of 2.0, whereas that for the red group resembles very much the globular cluster luminosity function in the Milky Way. Assuming an age of 5 Gyr, these red clusters have masses between 0.1 to 10 million solar masses.},

Equatorial coordinates, integrated magnitudes and angular sizes are listed for all 115 objects. Eight clusters have sufficiently red colors to be candidates for old globulars. For four clusters we extracted resolved stellar photometry. Object 33-3-018 located in the outer disk of M33 turned out to be a young cluster with an age estimated at 200-350 Myr. Cluster ZK-90 has an age of 3-5 Gyr. The remaining two clusters have intermediate ages ranging from one to a few Gyr.},

In particular, they have tested size-of-sample effects through the analysis of Monte Carlo simulations of LFs drawn from an assumed universal population like that characterizing the globular clusters in the Local Group. The authors have also considered the effects of the field objects that will contaminate real cluster LFs in remote galaxies and have tested for biases and the attainable precision in derived distances as a function of limiting magnitude (relative to the turnover in the luminosity function). The findings are that maximum-likelihood methods are very robust. Globular clusters are more far-reaching distance indicators than has previously been realized. The authors apply the maximum-likelihood methods to available data and comment upon the implications of the results and the future promise of the method.},

	Abstract = {We present an axisymmetric, equilibrium model for late-type galaxies which consists of an exponential disk, a S{\'e}rsic bulge, and a cuspy dark halo. The model is specified by a phase-space distribution function which, in turn, depends on the integrals of motion. Bayesian statistics and the Markov chain Monte Carlo method are used to tailor the model to satisfy observational data and theoretical constraints. By way of example, we construct a chain of 105 models for the Milky Way designed to fit a wide range of photometric and kinematic observations. From this chain, we calculate the probability distribution function of important Galactic parameters such as the S{\'e}rsic index of the bulge, the disk scale length, and the disk, bulge, and halo masses. We also calculate the probability distribution function of the local dark matter velocity dispersion and density, two quantities of paramount significance for terrestrial dark matter detection experiments. Although the Milky Way models in our chain all satisfy the prescribed observational constraints, they vary considerably in key structural parameters and therefore respond differently to nonaxisymmetric perturbations. We simulate the evolution of 25 models which have different Toomre Q and Goldreich-Tremaine X parameters. Virtually all of these models form a bar, although some more quickly than others. The bar pattern speeds are ~40-50 km s-1 kpc-1 at the time when they form and then decrease, presumably due to coupling of the bar with the halo. Since the Galactic bar has a pattern speed ~50 km s-1 kpc-1, we conclude that it must have formed recently.},

The models are chosen from a set first constructed by Kuijken & Dubinski. We develop an algorithm to search the parameter space for this set in order to best match observations of the M31 rotation curve, inner velocity dispersion profile, and surface brightness profile. Models are obtained for a large range of bulge and disk masses; we find that the disk mass must be <~8×1010 Msolar and that the preferred value for the bulge mass is 2.5×1010 Msolar. N-body simulations are carried out to test the stability of our models against the formation of a bar within the disk. We also calculate the baryon fraction and halo concentration parameter for a subset of our models and show that the results are consistent with the predictions from cosmological theories of structure formation. In addition, we describe how gravitational microlensing surveys and dynamical studies of globular clusters and satellites can further constrain the models.},

This is a new and simple way to estimate the enclosed mass from the projected positions and line-of-sight velocities of a tracer population (such as globular clusters, halo stars, and planetary nebulae). Like the projected mass estimator, it works by averaging (projecteddistance)(radialvelocity)2/G over the sample. However, it applies to the commonest case of all, in which the tracer population does not follow the overall dark matter density. The method is verified against simulated data sets drawn from Monte Carlo realizations of exact solutions of the collisionless Boltzmann equation and applied to the M31 globular cluster data set of Perrett and coworkers, as well as to M31's satellite galaxies.},

	Abstract = {This paper argues that the Milky Way galaxy is probably the largest member of the Local Group. The evidence comes from estimates of the total mass of the Andromeda galaxy (M31) derived from the three-dimensional positions and radial velocities of its satellite galaxies, as well as the projected positions and radial velocities of its distant globular clusters and planetary nebulae. The available data set comprises 10 satellite galaxies, 17 distant globular clusters and nine halo planetary nebulae with radial velocities. We find that the halo of Andromeda has a mass of ~ 12.3+18-6 x 1011 Msun, together with a scalelength of ~90kpc and a predominantly isotropic velocity distribution. For comparison, our earlier estimate for the Milky Way halo is 19+36-17 x 1011 Msun. Although the error bars are admittedly large, this suggests that the total mass of M31 is probably less than that of the Milky Way. We verify the robustness of our results to changes in the modelling assumptions and to errors caused by the small size and incompleteness of the data set. Our surprising claim can be checked in several ways in the near future. The numbers of satellite galaxies, planetary nebulae and globular clusters with radial velocities can be increased by ground-based spectroscopy, while the proper motions of the companion galaxies and the unresolved cores of the globular clusters can be measured using the astrometric satellites Space Interferometry Mission (SIM) and Global Astrometric Interferometer for Astrophysics (GAIA). Using 100 globular clusters at projected radii 20<~R<~50kpc with both radial velocities and proper motions, it will be possible to estimate the mass within 50kpc to an accuracy of ~20per cent. Measuring the proper motions of the companion galaxies with SIM and GAIA will reduce the uncertainty in the total mass caused by the small size of the data set to ~22per cent.},

Changes with redshift in the observed properties of field galaxies are directly related to the evolution of the disks and of the stellar populations. We see that changes in the rest-frame luminosity of a galaxy induce smaller values of half-light radii than are predicted assuming no evolution. Comparisons are presented with two observed samples from Mutz et al. and Smail et al.},

	Abstract = {We use the Hubble Ultra Deep Field to study the galaxy luminosity-size (M-Re) distribution. With a careful analysis of selection effects due to both detection completeness and measurement reliability, we identify bias-free regions in the M-Re plane for a series of volume-limited samples. By comparison to a nearby survey also having well-defined selection limits, namely the Millennium Galaxy Catalogue, we present clear evidence for evolution in surface brightness since z ~ 0.7. Specifically, we demonstrate that the mean, rest-frame B-band <μ>e for galaxies in a sample spanning 8 mag in luminosity between MB = -22 and -14 mag increases by ~1.0 mag arcsec-2 from z ~ 0.1 to 0.7. We also highlight the importance of considering surface brightness-dependent measurement biases in addition to incompleteness biases. In particular, the increasing, systematic underestimation of Kron fluxes towards low surface brightnesses may cause diffuse, yet luminous, systems to be mistaken for faint, compact objects.},

	Abstract = {The paper discusses disk galaxies formed from collapsing gas in extended haloes of dark material. It was assumed that these systems were produced by hierarchical clustering and have angular moments from tidal torques. Models were developed to determine the structure of the haloes in terms of observable properties of the disks. It was shown that: (1) collapse factors of 10 or more and halo-to-disk mass ratios of 5 or more are necessary to explain the rapid rotation of the disks; (2) the halo rotation curves computed on the basis of detailed conservation of angular momentum in the disks are flat, and (3) most disks are globally unstable to the formation of non-axisymmetric perturbations unless their mass-to-light ratios are much smaller than current estimates.},

	Abstract = {We develop an idealized inside-out formation model for disk galaxies to include a realistic mix of galaxy types and luminosities that provides a fair match to the traditional observables. The predictions of our infall models are compared against identical models with no-size evolution by generating fully realistic simulations of the Hubble Deep Field, from which we recover the angular size distributions. We find that our infall models produce angular size distributions that are nearly identical to those of our no-size evolution models in the case of a Omega =0 geometry but produce slightly smaller sizes in the case of a Omega =1 geometry, a difference we associate with the different amounts of cosmic time in our two models for evolving to relatively low redshifts ( z~1--2 ). Our infall models also predict a slightly smaller (11%--29%) number of large (disk scale lengths greater than 4 h^{-1}50 kpc) galaxies at z~0.7 for the Canada France Redshift Survey, as well as different increases in the central surface brightness of the disks for early-type spirals, the infall model predicting an increase by 1.2 mag out to z~2( Omega =0) and z~1( Omega =1) , while our no-size evolution models predict an increase of only 0.5 mag. This result suggests that infall models could be important for explaining the 1.2--1.6 mag increase in surface brightness reported by Schade and coworkers.},

	Abstract = {The Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) Nearby Galaxy Survey Treasury is a large Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/ACS treasury program to obtain resolved stellar photometry for a volume-limited sample of galaxies out to 4 Mpc. As part of this program, we have obtained deep ACS imaging of a field in the outer disk of the large spiral galaxy M81. The field contains the outskirts of a spiral arm as well as an area containing no current star formation. Our imaging results in a color-magnitude diagram (CMD) reaching to m F814W = 28.8 and m F606W = 29.5, one magnitude fainter than the red clump. Through detailed modeling of the full CMD, we quantify the age and metallicity distribution of the stellar populations contained in the field. The mean metallicity in the field is --1 < [M/H] < 0 and only a small fraction of stars have ages lsim 1 Gyr. The results show that most of the stars in this outer disk field were formed by z ~ 1 and that the arm structure at this radius has a lifetime of gsim 100 Myr. We discuss the measured evolution of the M81 disk in the context of surveys of high redshift disk galaxies and deep stellar photometry of other nearby galaxies. All of these indicate that massive spiral disks are mostly formed by z ~ 1 and that they have experienced rapid metal enrichment.},

	Abstract = {A comprehensive study of the measurement of star formation histories from colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) is presented, with an emphasis on a variety of subtle issues involved in the generation of model CMDs and maximum likelihood solution. Among these are the need for a complete sampling of the synthetic CMD, the use of proper statistics for dealing with Poisson-distributed data (and a demonstration of why χ 2 must not be used), measuring full uncertainties in all reported parameters, quantifying the goodness-of-fit, and questions of binning the CMD and incorporating outside information. Several example star formation history measurements are given. Two examples involve synthetic data, in which the input and recovered parameters can be compared to locate possible flaws in the methodology (none were apparent) and measure the accuracy with which ages, metallicities and star formation rates can be recovered. Solutions of the histories of seven Galactic dwarf spheroidal companions (Carina, Draco, Leo I, Leo II, Sagittarius, Sculptor and Ursa Minor) illustrate the ability to measure star formation histories given a variety of conditions - numbers of stars, complexity of star formation history and amount of foreground contamination. Significant measurements of ancient >8Gyr star formation are made in all seven galaxies. Sculptor, Draco and Ursa Minor appear entirely ancient, while the other systems show varying amounts of younger stars.},

	Abstract = {Previously calculated models of the collapse of protogalaxies with rotational and axial symmetry are extended to galaxies characterized by both a spheroidal component and a disk component containing a substantial fraction of the total mass. The predicted disk-to-bulge ratio is found to depend mainly on the assumed rate of star formation and its time variation. It is shown that formation of the spheroidal component requires an early stage of rapid star formation, while formation of the disk requires a later stage of much slower star formation to allow the residual gas to settle into the disk before forming stars. The calculations suggest that the slow phase of star formation may involve relatively diffuse gas, the rapid phase may involve strongly clumped gas, and the degree of clumping may depend on the intensity of the turbulence or collisions within the gas. The models also predict stellar metallicity distributions and kinematic properties that are in qualitative agreement with those of the stellar populations in the Milky Way and other spirals, as well as a long time scale for the formation of the outer regions of the disk.},

@article{MacArthur:2004,
	Abstract = {We investigate optical and near-IR color gradients in a sample of 172 low-inclination galaxies spanning Hubble types S0-Irr. The colors are compared with stellar population synthesis models from which luminosity-weighted average ages and metallicities are determined. We explore the effects of different underlying star formation histories and additional bursts of star formation. Our results are robust in a relative sense under the assumption that our galaxies shared a similar underlying star formation history and that no bursts involving more than ~10% of the galaxy mass have occurred in the past 1-2 Gyr. Because the observed gradients show radial structure, we measure ``inner'' and ``outer'' disk age and metallicity gradients. Trends in age and metallicity and their gradients are explored as a function of Hubble type, rotational velocity, total near-IR galaxy magnitude, central surface brightness, and scale length. We find strong correlations in age and metallicity with Hubble type, rotational velocity, total magnitude, and central surface brightness in the sense that earlier-type, faster rotating, more luminous, and higher surface brightness galaxies are older and more metal-rich, suggesting an early and more rapid star formation history for these galaxies. The increasing trends with rotational velocity and total magnitude level off for Vrot>~120kms-1 and MK<~-23 mag, respectively. This effect is stronger for metallicity (than age), which could reflect a threshold potential above which all metals are retained and thus metallicity saturates at the yield. Outer disk gradients are found to be weaker than the inner gradients as expected for a slower variation of the potential and surface brightness in the outer parts. We find that stronger age gradients are associated with weaker metallicity gradients. Trends in gradients with galaxy parameters are compared with model predictions: these trends do not agree with predictions of semianalytic models of hierarchical galaxy formation, possibly owing to the effect of bar-induced radial flows. The observed trends are in agreement with chemo-spectrophotometric models of spiral galaxy evolution based on CDM-motivated scaling laws but none of the hierarchical merging characteristics, implying a strong dependence of the star formation history of spiral galaxies on the galaxy potential and halo spin parameter.},

	Abstract = {All galaxies are thought to reside within large haloes of dark matter, whose properties can only be determined from indirect observations. The formation and assembly of galaxies is determined from the interplay between these dark matter haloes and the baryonic matter they host. Although statistical relations can be used to approximate how massive a galaxy's halo is, very few individual galaxies have direct measurements of their halo masses. We present a method to directly estimate the total mass of a galaxy's dark halo using its system of globular clusters. The link between globular cluster systems and halo masses is independent of a galaxy's type and environment, in contrast to the relationship between galaxy halo and stellar masses. This trend is expected in models where globular clusters form in early, rare density peaks in the cold dark matter density field and the epoch of reionization was roughly coeval throughout the Universe. We illustrate the general utility of this relation by demonstrating that a galaxy's supermassive black hole mass and global X-ray luminosity are directly proportional to their host dark halo masses, as inferred from our new method.},

	Abstract = {We present resolved stellar photometry of 4 fields along the major axis of the M33 disk from images taken with the Advanced Camera for Surveys aboard the Hubble Space Telescope. The photometry provides a detailed census of the red clump in all fields and reaches the ancient main sequence in the outermost field. Through detailed modeling of the color-magnitude diagrams, we find that the percentage of the stellar mass formed prior to z=1 changes from 71 +/- 9% in the innermost field to 16 +/- 6% in the outermost field. The disk shows a clear trend of increasing scale-length with time, evolving from 1.0 +/- 0.1 kpc 10 Gyr ago to 1.8 +/- 0.1 kpc at times more recent than 5 Gyr ago, in agreement with analytical predictions for disk growth. Beyond the disk truncation radius, however, the stellar density profile steepens with time and the age gradient reverses, in agreement with recent simulations. The late and slow growth of the stellar disk may be due in part to the low mass of M33.},

	Abstract = {We present Keck/HIRES spectra of 3 globular clusters in the outer halo of M31, at projected distances beyond ~80 kpc from M31. The measured recession velocities for all 3 globular clusters confirm their association with the globular cluster system of M31. We find evidence for a declining velocity dispersion with radius for the globular cluster system. Their measured internal velocity dispersions, derived virial masses and mass-to-light ratios are consistent with those for the bulk of the M31 globular cluster system. We derive old ages and metallicities which indicate that all 3 belong to the metal-poor halo globular cluster subpopulation. We find indications that the radial gradient of the mean metallicity of the globular cluster system interior to 50 kpc flattens in the outer regions, however it is still more metal-poor than the corresponding field stars at the same (projected) radius. },

	Abstract = {We have constrained the age of the globular cluster S312 in the Andromeda galaxy (M31) by comparing its multicolor photometry with theoretical stellar population synthesis models. This is both a check on the age of this globular cluster and a check on our methodology. Main-sequence photometry has been the most direct method for determining the age of a star cluster. S312 was observed as part of the Beijing-Arizona-Taiwan-Connecticut (BATC) Multicolor Sky Survey from 1995 February to 2003 December. The photometry of BATC images for S312 was taken with nine intermediate-band filters covering 5000-10000 {\AA}. Combined with photometry in the near-ultraviolet (NUV) of GALEX, broadband UBVR, and infrared JHKs of 2MASS, we obtained the accurate spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of S312 from 2267-20000 {\AA}. A quantitative comparison to simple stellar population models yields an age of 9.5+1.15-0.99 Gyr, which is in very good agreement with the previous determination by main-sequence photometry. S312 has a mass of 9.8+/-1.85×105 Msolar and is a medium-mass globular cluster in M31. By analyzing the errors of ages determined based on the SED-fitting method of this paper, secure age constraints are derived with errors of <3 Gyr for ages younger than 9 Gyr. In fact, the theoretical SEDs are not sensitive to the variation of age for ages > ~10 Gyr. Therefore, our method does not accurately distinguish globular clusters (GCs) as old as the majority of the Galactic GCs. We emphasize that our results show that even with multiband photometry spanning from NUV to Ks, our age constraints from SED fitting are distressingly uncertain, which has implications for age derivations in extragalactic globular cluster systems. },

	Abstract = {The structures of globular clusters (GCs) reflect their dynamical states and past histories. High-resolution imaging allows the exploration of morphologies of clusters in other galaxies. Surface brightness profiles from new Hubble Space Telescope observations of 34 GCs in M31 are presented, together with fits of several different structural models to each cluster. M31 clusters appear to be adequately fit by standard King models and do not obviously require alternate descriptions with relatively stronger halos, such as are needed to fit many GCs in other nearby galaxies. The derived structural parameters are combined with corrected versions of those measured in an earlier survey in order to construct a comprehensive catalog of structural and dynamical parameters for M31 GCs with a sample size similar to that for the Milky Way. Clusters in M31, the Milky Way, Magellanic Clouds, the Fornax dwarf spheroidal, and NGC 5128 define a very tight fundamental plane with identical slopes. The combined evidence for these widely different galaxies strongly reinforces the view that old GCs have near-universal structural properties, regardless of host environment.

Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555. These observations are associated with programs 8664, 9719, 9767, and 10260. },

	Abstract = {Aims.We present the first results of a large spectroscopic survey of globular clusters and candidate globular clusters in the nearby M 31 galaxy. The survey is aimed at the classification of known candidate M 31 clusters and at the study of their kinematic properties.
Methods: .We obtained low-resolution spectroscopy (λ/Δλ ≃ 800-1300) for 133 targets, including 76 yet-to-be-confirmed candidate clusters (i.e. with no previous spectroscopic information), 55 already-confirmed genuine M 31 clusters, and 2 uncertain candidates. Our observations allowed a reliable estimate of the target radial velocity, within a typical accuracy of ~$\pm$ 20 km s-1. The observed candidates have been robustly classified according to their radial velocity and shape parameters that allowed us to confidently discriminate between point sources and extended objects even from low-spatial-resolution imagery.
Results: .In our set of 76 candidate clusters we found: 42 newly-confirmed bona-fide M 31 clusters, 12 background galaxies, 17 foreground Galactic stars, 2 Hii regions belonging to M 31 and 3 unclassified (possibly M 31 clusters or foreground stars) objects. The classification of a few other candidates not included in our survey has been also reassessed on various observational bases. All the sources of radial velocity estimates for M 31 known globular clusters available in the literature have been compared and checked, and a homogeneous general list has been obtained for 349 confirmed clusters with radial velocity.
Conclusions: .Our results suggest that a significant number of genuine clusters (≳100) is still hidden among the plethora of known candidates proposed by various authors. Hence our knowledge of the globular cluster system of the M 31 galaxy is still far from complete even in terms of simple membership. },

@article{Galleti:2007,
	Abstract = {Aims.We present the first results of a large spectroscopic survey of candidate globular clusters located in the extreme outskirts of the nearby M 31 galaxy. The survey is aimed at ascertaining the nature of the selected candidates to increase the sample of confirmed M 31 clusters lying more that 2$\,^{\circ}$ away from the center of the galaxy. Methods: We obtained low resolution spectra (λ/Δλ ≃ 800-1300) of 48 targets selected from the Extended Source Catalogue of 2MASS, as in Galleti et al. (2005, A&A, 436, 535). The observed candidates have been robustly classified according to their radial velocity and by verifying their extended/point-source nature from ground-based optical images. We have also obtained a spectrum and a radial velocity estimate for the remote M 31 globular discovered by Martin et al. (2006b, MNRAS, 371, 1983). Results: Among the 48 observed candidates clusters we found: 35 background galaxies, 8 foreground Galactic stars, and 5 genuine remote globular clusters. One of them has been already identified independently by Mackey et al. (2007, ApJ, 655, L85), their GC1; the other four are completely new discoveries: B516, B517, B518, B519. The newly discovered clusters lie at projected distance 40 kpc ≲ R_p≲ 100 kpc from the center of M 31, and have absolute integrated magnitude -9.5 ≲ MV ≲ -7.5. For all the observed clusters we have measured the strongest Lick indices and we have obtained spectroscopic metallicity estimates. Mackey-GC1, Martin-GC1, B517 and B518 have spectra typical of old and metal poor globular clusters ([Fe/H] ≲ -1.3); B519 appears old but quite metal-rich ([Fe/H]~≃ -0.5); B516 presents very strong Balmer absorption lines: if this is indeed a cluster it should have a relatively young age (likely < 2 Gyr). Conclusions: The present analysis nearly doubles the number of M 31 globulars at R_p≥ 40 kpc. At odds with the Milky Way, M 31 appears to have a significant population of very bright globular clusters in its extreme outskirts.

We have searched for GCs on CCD images taken with Washington CMT1 filters at the KPNO 0.9 m telescope using the following steps: (1) inspection of morphological parameters given by the SExtractor package such as stellarity, full width at half-maximum, and ellipticity; (2) consulting the spectral types and radial velocities obtained from spectra taken with the Hydra spectrograph at the WIYN 3.5 m telescope; and (3) visual inspection of the images of each object. We have found 1164 GCs and GC candidates, of which 605 are newly found GCs and GC candidates and 559 are previously known GCs. Among the new objects there are 113 genuine GCs, 258 probable GCs, and 234 possible GCs, according to our classification criteria. Among the known objects there are 383 genuine GCs, 109 probable GCs, and 67 possible GCs. In total there are 496 genuine GCs, 367 probable GCs, and 301 possible GCs.

	Abstract = {We report the discovery of 40 new globular clusters (GCs) that have been found in surveys of the halo of M31 based on the Isaac Newton Telescope/Wide-Field Camera and Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope/Megacam imagery. A subset of these new GCs are of an extended, diffuse nature and include those already found in Huxor et al. The search strategy is described and basic positional and V and I photometric data are presented for each cluster. For a subset of these clusters, K-band photometry is also given. The new clusters continue to be found to the limit of the survey area (~100 kpc), revealing that the GC system of M31 is much more extended than previously realized. The new clusters increase the total number of confirmed GCs in M31 by approximately 10 per cent and the number of confirmed GCs beyond 1&deg; (~14 kpc) by more than 75 per cent. We have also used the survey imagery as well recent Hubble Space Telescope archival data to update the Revised Bologna Catalogue of M31 globular clusters. },
