	Abstract = {We discuss the different definitions of the mass of a halo in common use and how one may convert between them. Using N-body simulations we show that mass estimates based on spherical averages are much more tightly correlated with each other than with masses based on the number of particles in a halo. The mass functions pertaining to some different mass definitions are estimated and compared to the ``universal form'' of Jenkins et al. (\cite{JFWCCEY}). Using a different simulation pipeline and a different cosmological model we show that the mass function is well fit by the Jenkins et al. (\cite{JFWCCEY}) fitting function, strengthening the claim to universality made by those authors. We show that care must be taken to match the definitions of mass when using large N-body simulations to bootstrap scaling relations from smaller hydrodynamical runs to avoid observationally significant bias in the predictions for abundances of objects.},

@article{Brasseur:2011,
	Abstract = {We use deep wide-field photometry from the Large Binocular Camera to study the stellar and structural properties of the recently discovered Andromeda X and Andromeda XVII (And X and And XVII) dwarf galaxies. Using the mean apparent magnitude of the horizontal branch (HB), we derive distances of 621 +- 20 kpc to And X and 734+- 23 kpc to And XVII, closer by >60 kpc than the previous estimates which were based on red giant branch (RGB) observations. Thus our results warrant against the use of the RGB tip method for determining distances to systems with sparsely populated RGBs, and show how crucial HB observations are in obtaining accurate distances in systems such as these. We find that And X is a relatively faint (MV = -7.36), highly elongated (e = 0.48) system at a distance of 174 +- 62 kpc from Andromeda. And XVII is brighter (MV = -8.61) with an M31-centric distance of 73 kpc which makes it one of the closest satellites to Andromeda. Both galaxies are metal-poor: we derive <[Fe/H]>=-2.2 for And X, while And XVII shows <[Fe/H]> = -2.0, consistent with the relation of higher luminosity dwarfs being more metal- rich. Additionally, both galaxies show considerable intrinsic spreads in metallicity (0.2 and 0.3 dex for And X and And XVII respectively), consistent with multiple stellar populations.},

@article{SDSS-III-collaboration:-Hiroaki-Aihara:2011,
	Abstract = {The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) started a new phase in August 2008, with new instrumentation and new surveys focused on Galactic structure and chemical evolution, measurements of the baryon oscillation feature in the clustering of galaxies and the quasar Ly alpha forest, and a radial velocity search for planets around ~8000 stars. This paper describes the first data release of SDSS-III (and the eighth counting from the beginning of the SDSS). The release includes 5-band imaging of roughly 5200 deg^2 in the Southern Galactic Cap, bringing the total footprint of the SDSS imaging to 14,555 deg^2, or over a third of the Celestial Sphere. All the imaging data have been reprocessed with an improved sky-subtraction algorithm and a final, self-consistent recalibration and flat-field determination. This release also includes all data from the second phase of the Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Evolution (SEGUE-2), consisting of spectroscopy of approximately 118,000 stars at both high and low Galactic latitudes. All the more than half a million stellar spectra obtained with the SDSS spectrograph have been reprocessed through an improved stellar parameters pipeline, which has better determination of metallicity for high metallicity stars.},

@article{Dutton:2011,
	Abstract = {The degeneracy among the disk, bulge and halo contributions to galaxy rotation curves prevents an understanding of the distribution of baryons and dark matter in disk galaxies. In an attempt to break this degeneracy, we present an analysis of the spiral galaxy strong gravitational lens SDSS J2141-0001, discovered as part of the SLACS survey. We present new Hubble Space Telescope multicolor imaging, gas and stellar kinematics data derived from long-slit spectroscopy, and K-band LGS adaptive optics imaging, both from the Keck telescopes. We model the galaxy as a sum of concentric axisymmetric bulge, disk and halo components and infer the contribution of each component, using information from gravitational lensing and gas kinematics. This analysis yields a best-fitting total (disk plus bulge) stellar mass of log_{10}(Mstar/Msun)=10.99(+0.11,-0.25). The photometric data combined with stellar population synthesis models yield log_{10}(Mstar/Msun)=10.97\pm0.07, and 11.21\pm0.07 for the Chabrier and Salpeter IMFs, respectively. Assuming no cold gas, a Salpeter IMF is marginally disfavored. Accounting for the expected gas fraction of \simeq 20% reduces the lensing plus kinematics stellar mass by 0.10\pm0.05 dex, resulting in a Bayes factor of 11.9 in favor of a Chabrier IMF. The dark matter halo is roughly spherical, with minor to major axis ratio q_{halo}=0.91(+0.15,-0.13). The dark matter halo has a maximum circular velocity of V_{max}=276(+17,-18) km/s, and a central density parameter of log_{10}\Delta_{V/2}=5.9(+0.9,-0.5). This is higher than predicted for uncontracted dark matter haloes in LCDM cosmologies, log_{10}\Delta_{V/2}=5.2, indicating that either the halo has contracted in response to galaxy formation, or that the halo has a higher than average concentration. At 2.2 disk scale lengths the dark matter fraction is f_{DM}=0.55(+0.20,-0.15), making SDSS J2141-0001 sub-maximal.},

	Abstract = {The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) has validated and made publicly available its Second Data Release. This data release consists of 3324 deg2 of five-band (ugriz) imaging data with photometry for over 88 million unique objects, 367,360 spectra of galaxies, quasars, stars, and calibrating blank sky patches selected over 2627 deg2 of this area, and tables of measured parameters from these data. The imaging data reach a depth of r~22.2 (95% completeness limit for point sources) and are photometrically and astrometrically calibrated to 2% rms and 100 mas rms per coordinate, respectively. The imaging data have all been processed through a new version of the SDSS imaging pipeline, in which the most important improvement since the last data release is fixing an error in the model fits to each object. The result is that model magnitudes are now a good proxy for point-spread function magnitudes for point sources, and Petrosian magnitudes for extended sources. The spectroscopy extends from 3800 to 9200 {\AA} at a resolution of 2000. The spectroscopic software now repairs a systematic error in the radial velocities of certain types of stars and has substantially improved spectrophotometry. All data included in the SDSS Early Data Release and First Data Release are reprocessed with the improved pipelines and included in the Second Data Release. Further characteristics of the data are described, as are the data products themselves and the tools for accessing them.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes the Seventh Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), marking the completion of the original goals of the SDSS and the end of the phase known as SDSS-II. It includes 11,663 deg2 of imaging data, with most of the ~2000 deg2 increment over the previous data release lying in regions of low Galactic latitude. The catalog contains five-band photometry for 357 million distinct objects. The survey also includes repeat photometry on a 120$\,^{\circ}$ long, 2fdg5 wide stripe along the celestial equator in the Southern Galactic Cap, with some regions covered by as many as 90 individual imaging runs. We include a co-addition of the best of these data, going roughly 2 mag fainter than the main survey over 250 deg2. The survey has completed spectroscopy over 9380 deg2 the spectroscopy is now complete over a large contiguous area of the Northern Galactic Cap, closing the gap that was present in previous data releases. There are over 1.6 million spectra in total, including 930,000 galaxies, 120,000 quasars, and 460,000 stars. The data release includes improved stellar photometry at low Galactic latitude. The astrometry has all been recalibrated with the second version of the USNO CCD Astrograph Catalog, reducing the rms statistical errors at the bright end to 45 milliarcseconds per coordinate. We further quantify a systematic error in bright galaxy photometry due to poor sky determination; this problem is less severe than previously reported for the majority of galaxies. Finally, we describe a series of improvements to the spectroscopic reductions, including better flat fielding and improved wavelength calibration at the blue end, better processing of objects with extremely strong narrow emission lines, and an improved determination of stellar metallicities.},

	Abstract = {An unsupervised software ``robot'' that automatically and robustly reduces and analyzes CCD observations of photometric standard stars is described. The robot measures extinction coefficients and other photometric parameters in real time and, more carefully, on the next day. It also reduces and analyzes data from an all-sky 10 mum camera to detect clouds; photometric data taken during cloudy periods are automatically rejected. The robot reports its findings to observers and data analysts via the World Wide Web. It can be used to assess photometricity and to build data on site conditions. The robot's automated and uniform site monitoring represents a minimum standard for any observing site with queue scheduling, a public data archive, or likely participation in any future National Virtual Observatory.

	Abstract = {We describe a standard star catalog constructed using multiple SDSS photometric observations (at least four per band, with a median of 10) in the ugriz system. The catalog includes 1.01 million nonvariable unresolved objects from the equatorial stripe 82 (|deltaJ2000.0| < 1.266$\,^{\circ}$) in the right ascension range 20h34m-4h00m and with the corresponding r-band (approximately Johnson V-band) magnitudes in the range 14-22. The distributions of measurements for individual sources demonstrate that the photometric pipeline correctly estimates random photometric errors, which are below 0.01 mag for stars brighter than 19.5, 20.5, 20.5, 20, and 18.5 in ugriz, respectively (about twice as good as for individual SDSS runs). Several independent tests of the internal consistency suggest that the spatial variation of photometric zero points is not larger than ~0.01 mag (rms). In addition to being the largest available data set with optical photometry internally consistent at the ~1% level, this catalog provides a practical definition of the SDSS photometric system. Using this catalog, we show that photometric zero points for SDSS observing runs can be calibrated within a nominal uncertainty of 2% even for data obtained through 1 mag thick clouds, and we demonstrate the existence of He and H white dwarf sequences using photometric data alone. Based on the properties of this catalog, we conclude that upcoming large-scale optical surveys such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope will be capable of delivering robust 1% photometry for billions of sources.},

	Abstract = {We quantify the variability of faint unresolved optical sources using a catalog based on multiple SDSS imaging observations. The catalog covers SDSS stripe 82, which lies along the celestial equator in the southern Galactic hemisphere (22h24m < alphaJ2000.0 < 04h08m, -1.27$\,^{\circ}$ < deltaJ2000.0 < +1.27$\,^{\circ}$, ~290 deg2), and contains 34 million photometric observations in the SDSS ugriz system for 748,084 unresolved sources at high Galactic latitudes (b < -20$\,^{\circ}$) that were observed at least four times in each of the ugri bands (with a median of 10 observations obtained over ~6 yr). In each photometric bandpass we compute various low-order light-curve statistics, such as rms scatter, chi2 per degree of freedom, skewness, and minimum and maximum magnitude, and use them to select and study variable sources. We find that 2% of unresolved optical sources brighter than g = 20.5 appear variable at the 0.05 mag level (rms) simultaneously in the g and r bands (at high Galactic latitudes). The majority (2 out of 3) of these variable sources are low-redshift (<2) quasars, although they represent only 2% of all sources in the adopted flux-limited sample. We find that at least 90% of quasars are variable at the 0.03 mag level (rms) and confirm that variability is as good a method for finding low-redshift quasars as the UV excess color selection (at high Galactic latitudes). We analyze the distribution of light-curve skewness for quasars and find that it is centered on zero. We find that about one-fourth of the variable stars are RR Lyrae stars, and that only 0.5% of stars from the main stellar locus are variable at the 0.05 mag level. The distribution of light-curve skewness in the g - r versus u - g color-color diagram on the main stellar locus is found to be bimodal (with one mode consistent with Algol-like behavior). Using over 600 RR Lyrae stars, we demonstrate rich halo substructure out to distances of 100 kpc. We extrapolate these results to the expected performance by the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and estimate that it will obtain well-sampled, 2% accurate, multicolor light curves for ~2 million low-redshift quasars and discover at least 50 million variable stars.},

	Abstract = {The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) mosaic camera and telescope have obtained five-band optical-wavelength imaging near the Galactic plane outside of the nominal survey boundaries. These additional data were obtained during commissioning and subsequent testing of the SDSS observing system, and they provide unique wide-area imaging data in regions of high obscuration and star formation, including numerous young stellar objects, Herbig-Haro objects, and young star clusters. Because these data are outside the survey regions in the Galactic caps, they are not part of the standard SDSS data releases. This paper presents imaging data for 832 square degrees of sky (including repeats), in the star-forming regions of Orion, Taurus, and Cygnus. About 470 deg2 are now released to the public, with the remainder to follow at the time of SDSS Data Release 4. The public data in Orion include the star-forming region NGC 2068/NGC 2071/HH 24 and a large part of Barnard's loop.},

	Abstract = {In stellar dynamical computer simulations, as well as other types of simulations using particles, time step size is often held constant in order to guarantee a high degree of energy conservation. In many applications, allowing the time step size to change in time can offer a great saving in computational cost, but variable-size time steps usually imply a substantial degradation in energy conservation. We present a meta-algorithm' for choosing time steps in such a way as to guarantee time symmetry in any integration scheme, thus allowing vastly improved energy conservation for orbital calculations with variable time steps. We apply the algorithm to the familiar leapfrog scheme, and generalize to higher order integration schemes, showing how the stability properties of the fixed-step leapfrog scheme can be extended to higher order, variable-step integrators such as the Hermite method. We illustrate the remarkable properties of these time-symmetric integrators for the case of a highly eccentric elliptical Kepler orbit and discuss applications to more complex problems.},

	Abstract = {A novel method is described of directly calculating the force on N in the gravitational N-body problem that grows only as N log N. The technique uses a tree-structured hierarchical subdivision of space into cubic cells, each of which is recursively divided into eight subcells whenever more than one particle is found to occupy the same cell. This tree is constructed anew at every time step, avoiding ambiguity and tangling. Advantages over potential-solving codes include accurate local interactions, freedom from geometrical assumptions and restrictions, and applicability to a wide class of systems, including planetary, stellar, galactic, and cosmological ones. Advantages over previous hierarchical tree-codes include simplicity and the possibility of rigorous analysis of error.},

	Abstract = {We describe a new code for numerical solution of three-dimensional self-gravitational hydrodynamics problems. This code utilizes the technique of local adaptive mesh refinement (AMR), employing multiple grids at multiple levels of resolution and automatically and dynamically adding and removing these grids as necessary to maintain adequate resolution. This technology allows solution of problems that would be prohibitively expensive with a code using fixed resolution, and it is more versatile and efficient than competing methods of achieving variable resolution. In particular, we apply this technique to simulate the collapse and fragmentation of a molecular cloud, a key step in star formation. The simulation involves many orders of magnitude of variation in length scale as fragments form at positions that are not a priori discernible from general initial conditions. In this paper, we describe the methodology behind this new code and present several illustrative applications. The criterion that guides the degree of adaptive mesh refinement is critical to the success of the scheme, and, for the isothermal problems considered here, we employ the Jeans condition for this purpose. By maintaining resolution finer than the local Jeans length, we set new benchmarks of accuracy by which to measure other codes on each problem we consider, including the uniform collapse of a finite pressured cloud. We find that the uniformly rotating, spherical clouds treated here first collapse to disks in the equatorial plane and then, in the presence of applied perturbations, form filamentary singularities that do not fragment while isothermal. Our results provide numerical confirmation of recent work by Inutsuka & Miyama on this scenario of isothermal filament formation.},

@article{Henrion:2010,
	Abstract = {Star-galaxy classification is one of the most fundamental data-processing tasks in survey astronomy, and a critical starting point for the scientific exploitation of survey data. For bright sources this classification can be done with almost complete reliability, but for the numerous sources close to a survey's detection limit each image encodes only limited morphological information. In this regime, from which many of the new scientific discoveries are likely to come, it is vital to utilise all the available information about a source, both from multiple measurements and also prior knowledge about the star and galaxy populations. It is also more useful and realistic to provide classification probabilities than decisive classifications. All these desiderata can be met by adopting a Bayesian approach to star-galaxy classification, and we develop a very general formalism for doing so. An immediate implication of applying Bayes's theorem to this problem is that it is formally impossible to combine morphological measurements in different bands without using colour information as well; however we develop several approximations that disregard colour information as much as possible. The resultant scheme is applied to data from the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS), and tested by comparing the results to deep Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Stripe 82 measurements of the same sources. The Bayesian classification probabilities obtained from the UKIDSS data agree well with the deep SDSS classifications both overall (a mismatch rate of 0.022, compared to 0.044 for the UKIDSS pipeline classifier) and close to the UKIDSS detection limit (a mismatch rate of 0.068 compared to 0.075 for the UKIDSS pipeline classifier). The Bayesian formalism developed here can be applied to improve the reliability of any star-galaxy classification schemes based on the measured values of morphology statistics alone.},

	Abstract = {We present a new public archive of light-motion curves in Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Stripe 82, covering 99$\,^{\circ}$ in right ascension from to and spanning in declination from to , for a total sky area of ~249 deg2. Stripe 82 has been repeatedly monitored in the u, g, r, i and z bands over a seven-year baseline. Objects are cross-matched between runs, taking into account the effects of any proper motion. The resulting catalogue contains almost 4 million light-motion curves of stellar objects and galaxies. The photometry are recalibrated to correct for varying photometric zero-points, achieving ~20 and 30 mmag rms accuracy down to 18 mag in the g,r,i and z bands for point sources and extended sources, respectively. The astrometry are recalibrated to correct for inherent systematic errors in the SDSS astrometric solutions, achieving ~32 and 35 mas rms accuracy down to 18 mag for point sources and extended sources, respectively.  For each light-motion curve, 229 photometric and astrometric quantities are derived and stored in a higher level catalogue. On the photometric side, these include mean exponential and point spread function (PSF) magnitudes along with uncertainties, rms scatter, chi2 per degree of freedom, various magnitude distribution percentiles, object type (stellar or galaxy), and eclipse, Stetson and Vidrih variability indices. On the astrometric side, these quantities include mean positions, proper motions as well as their uncertainties and chi2 per degree of freedom. The light-motion curve catalogue presented here is complete down to r ~ 21.5 and is at present the deepest large-area photometric and astrometric variability catalogue available.},

@article{Watkins:2009,
	Abstract = {We present an analysis of the substructure revealed by RRLyraes in Sloan Digital Sky Survey Stripe 82, which covers in declination on the celestial equator over the right ascension range to . We use the new public archive of light-motion curves in Stripe 82, published by Bramich et al. in 2008, to identify a set of high-quality RRLyrae candidates. Period estimates are determined to high accuracy using a string-length method. A subset of 178 RRLyraes with spectrally derived metallicities are employed to derive metallicity-period-amplitude relations, which are then used, together with archive magnitude data and light-curve Fourier decomposition, to estimate metallicities and hence distances for the entire sample. The RRLyraes lie 5-115kpc from the Galactic Centre, with distance estimates accurate to ~8 per cent. The RRLyraes are further divided into subsets of 316 RRab types and 91 RRc types based on their period, colour and metallicity.  We fit a smooth density law to the distribution as a simple representation of the data. For Galactocentric radii 5-25kpc the number density of RRLyraes falls as r-2.4, but beyond 25kpc, the number density falls much more steeply, as r-4.5. However, we stress that in practice the density distribution is not smooth, but dominated by clumps and substructure. Samples of 55 and 237 RRLyraes associated with the Sagittarius Stream and the Hercules-Aquila Cloud, respectively, are identified. Hence, ~70 per cent of the RRLyraes in Stripe 82 belong to known substructure, and the sharp break in the density law reflects the fact that the dominant substructure in Stripe 82 - the Hercules-Aquila Cloud and the Sagittarius Stream - lie within 40kpc. In fact, almost 60 per cent of all the RRLyraes in Stripe 82 are associated with the Hercules-Aquila Cloud alone, which emphasizes the cloud's pre-eminence. Additionally, evidence of a new and distant substructure - the Pisces Overdensity - is found, consisting of 28 faint RRLyraes centred on Galactic coordinates (l ~ 80$\,^{\circ}$, b ~ -55$\,^{\circ}$), with distances of ~80kpc. The total stellar mass in the Pisces Overdensity is ~104Msolar and its metallicity is [Fe/H] ~ -1.5.},

@article{Wisdom:1991,
	Abstract = {The present study generalizes the mapping method of Wisdom (1982) to encompass all gravitational n-body problems with a dominant central mass. The rationale for the generalized mapping method is discussed as well as details for the mapping for the n-body problem. Some refinements of the method are considered, and the relationship of the mapping method to other symplectic integration methods is shown. The method is used to compute the evolution of the outer planets for a billion years. The resulting evolution is compared to the 845 million year evolution of the outer planets performed on the Digital Orerry using standard numerical integration techniques. This calculation provides independent numerical confirmation of the result of Sussman and Wisdom (1988) that the motion of the planet Pluto is chaotic.},

	Abstract = {The use of symplectic integration algorithms in long-term integrations in the field of celestial mechanics is discussed. The methods' advantages and disadvantages (with respect to more common integration methods) are discussed. The numerical performance of the algorithms is evaluated using the two-body and circular restricted three-body problems. Symplectic integration methods have the advantages of linear phase error growth in the two-body problem (unlike most other methods), good conservation of the integrals of the motion, good performance for moderately eccentric orbits, and ease of use. Its disadvantages include a relatively large number of force evaluations and an inability to continuously vary the step size.},

@article{Sesar:2010,
	Abstract = {We present an improved analysis of halo substructure traced by RR Lyrae stars in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) stripe 82 region. With the addition of SDSS-II data, a revised selection method based on new ugriz light curve templates results in a sample of 483 RR Lyrae stars that is essentially free of contamination. The main result from our first study persists: the spatial distribution of halo stars at galactocentric distances 5-100 kpc is highly inhomogeneous. At least 20% of halo stars within 30 kpc from the Galactic center can be statistically associated with substructure. We present strong direct evidence, based on both RR Lyrae stars and main-sequence stars, that the halo stellar number density profile significantly steepens beyond a Galactocentric distance of ~30 kpc, and a larger fraction of the stars are associated with substructure. By using a novel method that simultaneously combines data for RR Lyrae and main-sequence stars, and using photometric metallicity estimates for main-sequence stars derived from deep co-added u-band data, we measure the metallicity of the Sagittarius dSph tidal stream (trailing arm) toward R.A. ~2h-3h and decl. ~ 0$\,^{\circ}$ to be 0.3 dex higher ([Fe/H] = -1.2) than that of surrounding halo field stars. Together with a similar result for another major halo substructure, the Monoceros stream, these results support theoretical predictions that an early forming, smooth inner halo, is metal-poor compared to high surface brightness material that have been accreted onto a later-forming outer halo. The mean metallicity of stars in the outer halo that are not associated with detectable clumps may still be more metal-poor than the bulk of inner-halo stars, as has been argued from other data sets.},

A distinguished group of editors and experts who were already engaged in one way or another with the issues inherent in making research data public came together with statisticians to initiate a dialogue about policies and practicalities of requiring published research to be accompanied by publication of the research data. This dialogue carried beyond the broad issues of the advisability, the intellectual integrity, the scientific exigencies to the relevance of these issues to statistics as a discipline and the relevance of statistics, from inference to modeling to data exploration, to science and social science policies on these issues.},

@article{Conroy:2010,
	Abstract = {The conjecture that the ancient globular clusters (GCs) formed at the center of their own dark matter halos was first proposed by Peebles (1984), and has recently been revived to explain the puzzling abundance patterns observed within many GCs. In this Letter we demonstrate that the outer stellar density profile of isolated GCs is very sensitive to the presence of an extended dark halo. The GCs NGC 2419, located at 90 kpc from the center of our Galaxy, and MGC1, located at ~200 kpc from the center of M31, are ideal laboratories for testing the scenario that GCs formed at the centers of massive dark halos. Comparing analytic models to observations of these GCs, we conclude that these GCs cannot be embedded within dark halos with a virial mass greater than 10^6 Msun, or, equivalently, the dark matter halo mass-to-stellar mass ratio must be Mdm/M_*<1. If these GCs have indeed orbited within weak tidal fields throughout their lifetimes, then these limits imply that these GCs did not form within their own dark halos. Recent observations of an extended stellar halo in the GC NGC 1851 are also interpreted in the context of our analytic models. Implications of these results for the formation of GCs are briefly discussed.},

	Abstract = {We present the first detection of a 6.7 GHz Class II methanol (CH3OH) maser in the Andromeda galaxy (M31). The CH3OH maser was found in a Very Large Array (VLA) survey during the fall of 2009. We have confirmed the methanol maser with the new Expanded VLA (EVLA), in operation since March 2010, but were unsuccessful in detecting a water maser at this location. A direct application for this methanol maser is the determination of the proper motion of M31, such as was obtained with water masers in M33 and IC10 previously. Unraveling the three-dimensional velocity of M31 would solve for the biggest unknown in the modeling of the dynamics and evolution of the Local Group of galaxies.},

	Abstract = {Repeat scans by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) of a 278-deg2 stripe along the celestial equator have yielded an average of over 10 observations each for nearly 8000 spectroscopically confirmed quasars. Over 2500 of these quasars are in the redshift range such that the CIV lambda 1549 emission line is visible in the SDSS spectrum. Utilizing the width of these CIV lines and the luminosity of the nearby continuum, we estimate black hole masses for these objects. In an effort to isolate the effects of black hole mass and luminosity on the photometric variability of our data set, we create several subsamples by binning in these two physical parameters. By comparing the ensemble structure functions of the quasars in these bins, we are able to reproduce the well-known anticorrelation between luminosity and variability, now showing that this anticorrelation is independent of the black hole mass. In addition, we find a correlation between variability and the mass of the central black hole. By combining these two relations, we identify the Eddington ratio as a possible driver of quasar variability, most likely due to differences in accretion efficiency.},

	Abstract = {We study the evolution of the scaling relations between maximum circular velocity, stellar mass and optical half-light radius of star-forming disk-dominated galaxies in the context of LCDM-based galaxy formation models. Using data from the literature combined with new data from the DEEP2 and AEGIS surveys we show that there is a consistent observational and theoretical picture for the evolution of these scaling relations from z\sim 2 to z=0. The evolution of the observed stellar scaling relations is weaker than that of the virial scaling relations of dark matter haloes, which can be reproduced, both qualitatively and quantitatively, with a simple, cosmologically-motivated model for disk evolution inside growing NFW dark matter haloes. In this model optical half-light radii are smaller, both at fixed stellar mass and maximum circular velocity, at higher redshifts. This model also predicts that the scaling relations between baryonic quantities evolve even more weakly than the corresponding stellar relations. We emphasize, though, that this weak evolution does not imply that individual galaxies evolve weakly. On the contrary, individual galaxies grow strongly in mass, size and velocity, but in such a way that they move largely along the scaling relations. Finally, recent observations have claimed surprisingly large sizes for a number of star-forming disk galaxies at z \sim 2, which has caused some authors to suggest that high redshift disk galaxies have abnormally high spin parameters. However, we argue that the disk scale lengths in question have been systematically overestimated by a factor \sim 2, and that there is an offset of a factor \sim 1.4 between H\alpha sizes and optical sizes. Taking these effects into account, there is no indication that star forming galaxies at high redshifts (z\sim 2) have abnormally high spin parameters.},

@article{Bailer-Jones:2010,
	Abstract = {Astrometric surveys provide the opportunity to measure the absolute magnitudes of large numbers of stars, but only if the individual line-of-sight extinctions are known. Unfortunately, extinction is highly degenerate with stellar effective temperature when estimated from broad band optical/infrared photometry. To address this problem, I introduce a Bayesian method for estimating the intrinsic parameters of a star and its line-of-sight extinction. It uses both photometry and parallaxes in a self-consistent manner in order to provide a non-parametric posterior probability distribution over the parameters. The method makes explicit use of domain knowledge by employing the Hertzsprung--Russell Diagram (HRD) to constrain solutions and to ensure that they respect stellar physics. I first demonstrate this method by using it to estimate effective temperature and extinction from BVJHK data for a set of artificially reddened Hipparcos stars, for which accurate effective temperatures have been estimated from high resolution spectroscopy. Using just the four colours, we see the expected strong degeneracy (positive correlation) between the temperature and extinction. Introducing the parallax, apparent magnitude and the HRD reduces this degeneracy and improves both the precision (reduces the error bars) and the accuracy of the parameter estimates, the latter by about 35%. The resulting accuracy is about 200K in temperature and 0.2mag in extinction. I then apply the method to estimate these parameters and absolute magnitudes for some 47000 F,G,K Hipparcos stars which have been cross-matched with 2MASS. The method can easily be extended to incorporate the estimation of other parameters, in particular metallicity and surface gravity, making it particularly suitable for the analysis of the 10^9 stars from Gaia.},

	Abstract = {We dissect giant Sc-Scd galaxies with Hubble Space Telescope photometry and Hobby-Eberly Telescope spectroscopy. We use HET's High Resolution Spectrograph (resolution = 15,000) to measure stellar velocity dispersions in the nuclear star clusters and pseudobulges of the pure-disk galaxies M33, M101, NGC 3338, NGC 3810, NGC 6503, and NGC 6946. We conclude: (1) Upper limits on the masses of any supermassive black holes are MBH <= (2.6+-0.5) * 10**6 M_Sun in M101 and MBH <= (2.0+-0.6) * 10**6 M_Sun in NGC 6503. (2) HST photometry shows that the above galaxies contain tiny pseudobulges that make up <~ 3 % of the stellar mass but no classical bulges. We inventory a sphere of radius 8 Mpc centered on our Galaxy to see whether giant, pure-disk galaxies are common or rare. In this volume, 11 of 19 galaxies with rotation velocity > 150 km/s show no evidence for a classical bulge. Four may contain small classical bulges that contribute 5-12% of the galaxy light. Only 4 of the 19 giant galaxies are ellipticals or have classical bulges that contribute 1/3 of the galaxy light. So pure-disk galaxies are far from rare. It is hard to understand how they could form as the quiescent tail of a distribution of merger histories. Recognition of pseudobulges makes the biggest problem with cold dark matter galaxy formation more acute: How can hierarchical clustering make so many giant, pure-disk galaxies with no evidence for merger-built bulges? This problem depends strongly on environment: the Virgo cluster is not a puzzle, because >2/3 of its stellar mass is in merger remnants.},

	Abstract = {Fully cosmological, high-resolution N-body+smooth particle hydrodynamic simulations are used to investigate the chemical abundance trends of stars in simulated stellar halos as a function of their origin. These simulations employ a physically motivated supernova feedback recipe, as well as metal enrichment, metal cooling, and metal diffusion. As presented in an earlier paper, the simulated galaxies in this study are surrounded by stellar halos whose inner regions contain both stars accreted from satellite galaxies and stars formed in situ in the central regions of the main galaxies and later displaced by mergers into their inner halos. The abundance patterns ([Fe/H] and [O/Fe]) of halo stars located within 10 kpc of a solar-like observer are analyzed. We find that for galaxies which have not experienced a recent major merger, in situ stars at the high [Fe/H] end of the metallicity distribution function are more [alpha/Fe]-rich than accreted stars at similar [Fe/H]. This dichotomy in the [O/Fe] of halo stars at a given [Fe/H] results from the different potential wells within which in situ and accreted halo stars form. These results qualitatively match recent observations of local Milky Way halo stars. It may thus be possible for observers to uncover the relative contribution of different physical processes to the formation of stellar halos by observing such trends in the halo populations of the Milky Way and other local Lsstarf galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the variety in quasar UV spectra (lambdalambda1020-1600), with emphasis on the weak emission lines in the Lyalpha forest region, using principal component analysis (PCA). We use 50 smooth continuum-fitted quasar spectra (0.14<z<1.04) taken by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Faint Object Spectrograph. The first, second, and third principal component spectra (PCS) account for 63.4%, 14.5%, and 6.2% of the variance, respectively, and the first seven PCS account for 96.1% of the total variance. Three weak emission lines in the Lyalpha forest are identified as Fe II lambda1070.95, Fe II + Fe III lambda1123.17, and C III* lambda1175.88. Using the first two standardized PCS coefficients, we introduce five classifications. By actively using PCS, we can generate artificial quasar spectra that are useful in testing the detection of quasars, DLAs, and the continuum calibration. We show that the power-law-extrapolated continuum is inadequate to perform precise measurements of the mean flux in the Lyalpha forest because of the weak emission lines and the extended tails of Lyalpha and Lybeta/O VI emission lines. We show that we miss 5.3% of the flux on average, and there are cases where we would miss 14% of the flux. These corrections are essential in the study of the intergalactic medium at high redshift in order to achieve precise measurements of physical properties, cosmological parameters, and the reionization epoch.},

	Abstract = {High resolution spectroscopy of high redshift quasar spectra enables us to investigate the properties of the intergalactic medium (IGM) and measure cosmological parameters from the Lya forest. Toward high precision cosmology, this dissertation presents the following four topics. (1) Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on quasar spectrum: We introduce the PCA to describe quasar emission lines and continua quantitatively, and we attempt to make a prediction of the continuum shape in the Lya forest using wavelengths redward of Lya emission. (2) Flux calibration of Keck HIRES data: On our way to achieve high accuracy measurement, it was necessary to develop new calibration schemes and explore the origin of systematic errors. My contribution includes the following and is discussed throughout the thesis: (i) the development of the flux calibration scheme, (ii) the discovery of three emission lines in the Lya forest, (iii) the establishment of high resolution standard star spectra, and (iv) the identification of ozone lines in the spectrum. (3) D/H measurement: We present precise measurements of the primordial deuterium to hydrogen ratio (D/ H) toward two quasars, HS0105+1619 and Q1243+3047, which constrains the baryon to photon ratio e = 5.9 +/- 0.5 x 10 -10 or the baryon density O b h 2 = 0.0214 +/- 0.0020 via the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis theory. (4) Studies of the Lya forest at z ~ 2: We also present the measurements of the total amount of neutral hydrogen absorption in the IGM. We compare our observed data with hydrodynamic simulations and find good agreement when we use the following cosmological parameters: H o = 71 kin s -1 Mpc -1 , O L = 0.73, O m = 0.27, O b = 0.044, the amplitude of the power spectrum s 8 = 0.9, and the photoinization rate G 912 = (1.44 +/- 0.11) x 10 -12 s -1 . We conclude that the measurements of the cosmological parameters from our primordial D/H measurements, recent WMAP satellite observation of the cosmic microwave background, and our the total amount of neutral hydrogen in the IGM at z ~ 2 are in a concordance with the LCDM model.},

	Abstract = {We present a method to make predictions with sets of correlated data values, in this case QSO flux spectra. We predict the continuum in the Lyalpha forest of a QSO, from 1020 to 1216 {\AA}, using the spectrum of that QSO from 1216 to 1600 {\AA}. We find correlations between the unabsorbed flux in these two wavelength regions in the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) spectra of 50 QSOs. We use principal component analysis to summarize the variety of these spectra, relate the weights of the principal components for 1020-1600 {\AA} to the weights for 1216-1600 {\AA}, and apply this relation to make predictions. We test the method on the HST spectra and find an average absolute flux error of 9%, with a range of 3%-30%, where individual predictions are systematically too low or too high. We mention several ways in which the predictions might be improved.},

	Abstract = {We go through the many considerations involved in fitting a model to data, using as an example the fit of a straight line to a set of points in a two-dimensional plane. Standard weighted least-squares fitting is only appropriate when there is a dimension along which the data points have negligible uncertainties, and another along which all the uncertainties can be described by Gaussians of known variance; these conditions are rarely met in practice. We consider cases of general, heterogeneous, and arbitrarily covariant two-dimensional uncertainties, and situations in which there are bad data (large outliers), unknown uncertainties, and unknown but expected intrinsic scatter in the linear relationship being fit. Above all we emphasize the importance of having a "generative model" for the data, even an approximate one. Once there is a generative model, the subsequent fitting is non-arbitrary because the model permits direct computation of the likelihood of the parameters or the posterior probability distribution. Construction of a posterior probability distribution is indispensible if there are "nuisance parameters" to marginalize away.},

@article{Dutton:2005,
	Abstract = {This paper addresses available constraints on mass models fitted to rotation curves. Mass models of disk galaxies have well-known degeneracies that prevent a unique mass decomposition. The most notable is due to the unknown value of the stellar mass-to-light ratio (the disk-halo degeneracy); even with this known, degeneracies between the halo parameters themselves may prevent an unambiguous determination of the shape of the dark halo profile, which includes the inner density slope of the dark matter halo. The latter is often referred to as the ``cusp-core degeneracy.'' We explore constraints on the disk and halo parameters and apply these to four mock and six observed disk galaxies with high resolution and extended rotation curves. Our full set of constraints consists of mass-to-light (M/L) ratios from stellar population synthesis models based on B-R colors, constraints on halo parameters from N-body simulations, and constraining the halo virial velocity to be less than the maximum observed velocity. These constraints are only partially successful in lifting the cusp-core degeneracy. The effect of adiabatic contraction of the halo by the disk is to steepen cores into cusps and reduce the best-fit halo concentration and M/L values (often significantly). We also discuss the effect of disk thickness, halo flattening, distance errors, and rotation curve error values on mass modeling. Increasing the imposed minimum rotation curve error from typically low, underestimated values to more realistic estimates decreases the chi2 substantially and makes distinguishing between a cuspy or cored halo profile even more difficult. In spite of the degeneracies and uncertainties present, our constrained mass modeling favors submaximal disks (i.e., a dominant halo) at 2.2 disk scale lengths, with Vdisk/Vtot<~0.6. This result holds for both the unbarred and weakly barred galaxies in our sample.},

	Abstract = {We search for signs of rotation in the subsystems of the Milky Way and M31 that are defined by their satellite galaxies, their globular cluster populations, and their BHB stars. A set of simple distribution functions are introduced to describe anisotropic and rotating stellar populations embedded in dark haloes of approximate Navarro-Frenk-White form. The BHB stars in the Milky Way halo exhibit a dichotomy between a prograde rotating, comparatively metal-rich component ([Fe/H] > -2) and a retrograde rotating, comparatively metal-poor ([Fe/H] < -2) component. The prograde metal-rich population may be associated with the accretion of a massive satellite (~ 10^9 solar masses). The metal-poor population may characterise the primordial stellar halo and the net retrograde rotation could then reflect an underestimate in our adopted local standard of rest circular velocity Theta_0. If Theta_0 is ~ 240 km/s then the metal-poor component has no rotation and there is a net prograde rotation signal of ~45 km/s in the metal-rich component. There is reasonable evidence that the Milky Way globular cluster and satellite galaxy systems are rotating with <v_phi> ~50 km/s and <v_phi> ~ 40 km/s respectively. Furthermore, a stronger signal is found for the satellite galaxies when the angular momentum vector of the satellites is inclined with respect to the normal of the disc. The dwarf spheroidal satellites of M31 exhibit prograde rotation relative to the M31 disc with <v_phi> ~ 40 km/s. We postulate that this group of dwarf spheroidals may share a common origin.

	Abstract = {The behavior of density waves in a simple analog of a rotating disk is analyzed. The model considered is a thin gas sheet whose unperturbed velocity field is a parallel shear flow; the effects of rotation are simulated by introducing a Coriolis acceleration; the model exhibits Lindblad resonances and includes both long- and short-wavelength density waves among its linear perturbations. The linear perturbation equations are set up in a form appropriate to the model and rewritten in terms of the comoving coordinates of the unperturbed flow. The resulting equations are Fourier transformed and then solved in the tight-winding limit. The excitation of a wave packet by an external potential is calculated along with the packet's subsequent propagation, and analytical solutions are obtained which are valid everywhere, including the Lindblad and corotation resonances. It is found that a barlike potential excites long-wavelength trailing density waves at the Lindblad resonances. The amplification of a density wave incident on the forbidden zone surrounding corotation is also examined.},

	Abstract = {The linear response of a differentially rotating two-dimensional gas disk, both with and without self-gravity, to a rigidly rotating external potential is calculated on the assumptions that the speed of sound is much smaller that the orbital velocity and that the external potential varies on the scale of the disk radius. The results show that: (1) the external potential exerts torques on the disk only at the Lindblad and corotation resonances; (2) the torque is positive at the outer Lindblad resonance and negative at the inner Lindblad resonance; (3) the torque at corotation has the sign of the radial vorticity gradient; and (4) the torques are of the same order of magnitude at both types of resonance and independent of the speed of sound in the disk. It is found that the external potential also excites density waves in the vicinity of the Lindblad and corotation resonances, that the long trailing wave is excited at a Lindblad resonance, and that short trailing waves are excited at the corotation resonance. The behavior of particle disks is briefly discussed, and the external torques on particle disks are proven to be identical to those on gas disks},

	Abstract = {Two-component mass models, consisting of an exponential disk and a spherical halo, are constructed to fit a newly determined rotation curve of NGC 3198 that extends to 11 disk scale lengths. The amount of dark matter inside the last point of the rotation curve, at 30 kpc, is at least 4 times larger than the amount of visible matter, with M/L(B)tot = 18 solar M/L(B). The maximum mass-to-light ratio for the disk is M/L(B) = 3.6. The available data cannot discriminate between disk models with low M/L and high M/L, but arguments are presented which suggest that the true mass-to-light ratio of the disk is close to the maximum computed value. The core radius of the distribution of dark matter is found to satisfy R(core) of between 1.7 and 12.5 kpc.},

@article{Bell:2003,
	Abstract = {We use a large sample of galaxies from the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to calculate galaxy luminosity and stellar mass functions in the local universe. We estimate corrections for passband shifting and galaxy evolution, as well as present-day stellar mass-to-light (M/L) ratios, by fitting the optical-near-infrared galaxy data with simple models. Accounting for the 8% galaxy overdensity in the SDSS early data release region, the optical and near-infrared luminosity functions we construct for this sample agree with most recent literature optical and near-infrared determinations within the uncertainties. We argue that 2MASS is biased against low surface brightness galaxies and use SDSS plus our knowledge of stellar populations to estimate the ``true'' K-band luminosity function. This has a steeper faint end slope and a slightly higher overall luminosity density than the direct estimate. Furthermore, assuming a universally applicable stellar initial mass function (IMF), we find good agreement between the stellar mass function we derive from the 2MASS/SDSS data and that derived by Cole et al. The faint end slope for the stellar mass function is steeper than -1.1, reflecting the low stellar M/L ratios characteristic of low-mass galaxies. We estimate an upper limit to the stellar mass density in the local universe Omega*h=2.0+/-0.6×10-3 by assuming an IMF as rich in low-mass stars as allowed by observations of galaxy dynamics in the local universe. The stellar mass density may be lower than this value if a different IMF with fewer low-mass stars is assumed. Finally, we examine type-dependence in the optical and near-infrared luminosity functions and the stellar mass function. In agreement with previous work, we find that the characteristic luminosity or mass of early-type galaxies is larger than for later types, and the faint end slope is steeper for later types than for earlier types. Accounting for typing uncertainties, we estimate that at least half, and perhaps as much as 3/4, of the stellar mass in the universe is in early-type galaxies. As an aid to workers in the field, we present in an Appendix the relationship between model stellar M/L ratios and colors in SDSS/2MASS passbands, an updated discussion of near-infrared stellar M/L ratio estimates, and the volume-corrected distribution of g- and K-band stellar M/L ratios as a function of stellar mass.},

	Abstract = {Aims: We test cosmological models of structure formation using the rotation curve of the nearest spiral galaxy, M 31, determined using a recent deep, full-disk 21-cm imaging survey smoothed to 466 pc resolution.  Methods: We fit a tilted ring model to the HI data from 8 to 37 kpc and establish conclusively the presence of a dark halo and its density distribution via dynamical analysis of the rotation curve.  Results: The disk of M 31 warps from 25 kpc outwards and becomes more inclined with respect to our line of sight. Newtonian dynamics without a dark matter halo provide a very poor fit to the rotation curve. In the framework of modified Newtonian dynamic (MOND) however the 21-cm rotation curve is well fitted by the gravitational potential traced by the baryonic matter density alone. The inclusion of a dark matter halo with a density profile as predicted by hierarchical clustering and structure formation in a LambdaCDM cosmology makes the mass model in newtonian dynamic compatible with the rotation curve data. The dark halo concentration parameter for the best fit is C = 12 and its total mass is 1.2 × 1012 M_o. If a dark halo model with a constant-density core is considered, the core radius has to be larger than 20 kpc in order for the model to provide a good fit to the data. We extrapolate the best-fit LambdaCDM and constant-density core mass models to very large galactocentric radii, comparable to the size of the dark matter halo. A comparison of the predicted mass with the M 31 mass determined at such large radii using other dynamical tracers, confirms the validity of our results. In particular the LambdaCDM dark halo model which best fits the 21-cm data well reproduces the mass of M 31 traced out to 560 kpc. Our best estimate for the total mass of M 31 is 1.3 × 1012 M_o, with 12% baryonic fraction and only 6% of the baryons in the neutral gas phase.},

	Abstract = {A new, 2.8 deg2 J, H, Ks near-infrared (NIR) survey from the 2MASS 6X program across the extent of the optical disk of the Andromeda (M31) galaxy provides a clear view of the M31 center almost completely unfettered by dust extinction and reveals a high-contrast bulge with very boxy isophotes dominating the NIR light to a semimajor axis of ~700" (2.6 kpc). The inner bulge (<~50") isophotes are relatively circular but show some twisting. Beyond this, (1) the M31 bulge ellipticity increases, (2) its position angle is constant at ~50$\,^{\circ}$, or about 10$\,^{\circ}$ higher than the position angle of the M31 disk, and (3) its boxiness increases to a degree (~3%-4%) comparable to other renowned examples of boxy bulges observed in the NIR. In a companion paper, self-consistent N-body simulations of a classical bulge plus a bar with a boxy bulge are shown to reproduce the observed NIR M31 features presented here. Beyond the boxy bulge region and nearly along the 40$\,^{\circ}$ position angle of the disk a narrow ridge of NIR flux, which can be identified with the thin part of the bar, more or less symmetrically extends into the inner disk at semimajor axis radii of 700"-1200" or more. Little variation in the morphology or relative brightnesses of these various M31 structures is seen across the NIR bands (e.g., no color gradients are seen). These new data verify that M31 is a barred spiral galaxy like the Milky Way.},

	Abstract = {We show that bars in galaxy models having halos of moderate density and a variety of velocity distributions all experience a strong drag from dynamical friction unless the halo has large angular momentum in the same sense as the disk. The frictional drag decreases the bar pattern speed, driving the corotation point out to distances well in excess of those estimated in barred galaxies. The halo angular momentum required to avoid strong braking is unrealistically large, even when rotation is confined to the inner halo only. We conclude, therefore, that bars are able to maintain their observed high pattern speeds only if the halo has a central density low enough for the disk to provide most of the central attraction in the inner galaxy. We present evidence that this conclusion holds for all bright galaxies.},

@article{Dehnen:1998a,
	Abstract = {A parametrized model of the mass distribution within the Milky Way is fitted to the available observational constraints. The most important single parameter is the ratio of the scalelength Rd,* of the stellar disk to R0. The disk and bulge dominate vc(R) at R not greater than about R0 only for Rd,*/R0 not greater than about 0.3. Since the only knowledge we have of the halo derives from studies like the present one, we allow it to contribute to the density at all radii. When allowed this freedom, however, the halo causes changes in assumptions relating to R much less than R0 to affect profoundly the structure of the best-fitting model at R much greater than R0. For example, changing the disk slightly from an exponential surface-density profile significantly changes the form of vc(R) at R much greater than R0, where the disk makes a negligible contribution to vc. Moreover, minor changes in the constraints can cause the halo to develop a deep hole at its center that is not physically plausible. These problems call into question the proposition that flat rotation curves arise because galaxies have physically distinct haloes rather than outward-increasing mass-to-light ratios.},

	Abstract = {The kinematic signature of individual spiral arm segments are used here to make a very compact yet quite complete parameterization of the global neutral hydrogen content of M31. Two continuous, trailing spiral arms can be traced from about 0.5 to 27 kpc from the nucleus which accurately account for the kinematic and spatial distribution of gas. The three-dimensional geometry of the gas distribution is derived with only limited assumptions concerning axisymmetry of the velocity field. Significant variations in inclination as a function of azimuth and radius are found, leading to departures of the local midplane from a few hundred pc in a tilted disk in the inner galaxy to in excess of a kpc in the 'warp' of the outer galaxy. The distribution of exponential scale height of the gas with radius varies between 200 and 600 pc, and the spiral pattern in the inner galaxy has an elliptical distortion which leads to significant corrections to the axisymmetric rotation velocity and implied mass distribution.},

	Abstract = {The density profiles and shapes of dark halos are studied using the results of N-body simulations of the gravitational collapse of density peaks. The simulations use from 30,000 to 300,000 particles, which allow density profiles and shapes to be well resolved. The core radius of a typical dark halo is found to be no greater than the softening radius, epsilon = 1.4 kpc. The density profiles can be fitted with an analytical model with an effective power law which varies between -1 in the center to -4 at large radii. The dark halos have circular velocity curves which behave like the circular velocity contribution of the dark component of spiral galaxies inferred from rotation curve decompositions. The halos are strongly triaxial and very flat, with (c/a) = 0.50 and (b/a) = 0.71. There are roughly equal numbers of dark halos with oblate and prolate forms. The distribution of ellipticities in projection for dark halos reaches a maximum at epsilon = 0.5, in contrast to the ellipticity distribution of elliptical galaxies, which peaks at epsilon = 0.2.},

@article{Navarro:1996,
	Abstract = {We use N-body simulations to investigate the structure of dark halos in the standard cold dark matter cosmogony. Halos are excised from simulations of cosmologically representative regions and are resimulated individually at high resolution. We study objects with masses ranging from those of dwarf galaxy halos to those of rich galaxy clusters. The spherically averaged density profiles of all our halos can be fitted over two decades in radius by scaling a simple "universal" profile. The characteristic over- density of a halo, or equivalently its concentration, correlates strongly with halo mass in a way that reflects the mass dependence of the epoch of halo formation. Halo profiles are approximately isothermal over a large range in radii but are significantly shallower than r -2 near the center and steeper than r-2 near the virial radius. Matching the observed rotation curves of disk galaxies requires disk mass-to-light ratios to increase systematically with luminosity. Further, it suggests that the halos of bright galaxies depend only weakly on galaxy luminosity and have circular velocities significantly lower than the disk rotation speed. This may explain why luminosity and dynamics are uncorrelated in observed samples of binary galaxies and of satellite/spiral systems. For galaxy clusters, our halo models are consistent both with the presence of giant arcs and with the observed structure of the intracluster medium, and they suggest a simple explanation for the disparate estimates of cluster core radii found by previous authors. Our results also highlight two shortcomings of the CDM model. CDM halos are too concentrated to be consistent with the halo parameters inferred for dwarf irregulars, and the predicted abundance of galaxy halos is larger than the observed abundance of galaxies. The first problem may imply that the core structure of dwarf galaxies was altered by the galaxy formation process, and the second problem may imply that galaxies failed to form (or remain undetected) in many dark halos.},

	Abstract = {ABSTRACT We present the first spectroscopic analysis of the faint M31 satellite galaxies, AndXI and AndXIII, as well as a re-analysis of existing spectroscopic data for two further faint companions, AndIX (correcting for an error in earlier geometric modelling that caused a misclassification of member stars in previous work) and AndXII. By combining data obtained using the Deep Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph (DEIMOS) mounted on the Keck II telescope with deep photometry from the Suprime-Cam instrument on Subaru, we have identified the most probable members for each of the satellites based on their radial velocities (precise to several down to i ~ 22), distance from the centre of the dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) and their photometric [Fe/H]. Using both the photometric and spectroscopic data, we have also calculated global properties for the dwarfs, such as systemic velocities, metallicities and half-light radii. We find each dwarf to be very metal poor ([Fe/H] ~ -2 both photometrically and spectroscopically, from their stacked spectrum), and as such, they continue to follow the luminosity-metallicity relationship established with brighter dwarfs. We are unable to resolve dispersion for AndXI due to small sample size and low signal-to-noise ratio, but we set a 1sigma upper limit of sigmav < 4.5kms-1. For AndIX, AndXII and AndXIII we resolve velocity dispersions of sigmav = 4.5+3.6-3.4, 2.6+5.1-2.6 and 9.7+8.9-4.5kms-1, though we note that the dispersion for AndXIII is based on just three stars. We derive masses within the half-light radii for these galaxies of 6.2+5.3-5.1 × 106, 2.4+6.5-2.4 × 106 and 1.1+1.4-0.7 × 107Msolar, respectively. We discuss each satellite in the context of the Mateo relations for dSphs, and in reference to the universal halo profiles established for Milky Way dwarfs. Both AndIX and AndXII fall below the universal halo profiles of Walker et al., indicating that they are less massive than would be expected for objects of their half-light radius. When combined with the findings of McConnachie & Irwin, which reveal that the M31 satellites are twice as extended (in terms of both half-light and tidal radii) as their Milky Way counterparts, these results suggest that the satellite population of the Andromeda system could inhabit haloes that with regard to their central densities are significantly different from those of the Milky Way.  The data presented herein were obtained at the W.M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W.M. Keck Foundation.

@article{Watkins:2010,
	Abstract = {ABSTRACT We present a family of robust tracer mass estimators to compute the enclosed mass of galaxy haloes from samples of discrete positional and kinematical data of tracers, such as halo stars, globular clusters and dwarf satellites. The data may be projected positions, distances, line-of-sight velocities or proper motions. The estimators all assume that the tracer population has a scale-free density and moves in a scale-free potential in the region of interest. The circumstances under which the boundary terms can be discarded and the estimator converges are derived. Forms of the estimator tailored for the Milky Way Galaxy and for M31 are given. Monte Carlo simulations are used to quantify the uncertainty as a function of sample size.  For the Milky Way Galaxy, the satellite sample consists of 26 galaxies with line-of-sight velocities. We find that the mass of the Milky Way within 300 kpc is M300 = 0.9 +/- 0.3 × 1012Msolar assuming velocity isotropy. However, the mass estimate is sensitive to the assumed anisotropy and could plausibly lie between 0.7 × 1012 and 3.4 × 1012Msolar, if anisotropies implied by simulations or by the observations are used. Incorporating the proper motions of six Milky Way satellites into the data set, we find M300 = 1.4 +/- 0.3 × 1012Msolar. The range here if plausible anisotropies are used is still broader, from 1.2 × 1012 to 2.7 × 1012Msolar. Note that our error bars only incorporate the statistical uncertainty. There are much greater uncertainties induced by velocity anisotropy and by selection of satellite members.  For M31, there are 23 satellite galaxies with measured line-of-sight velocities, but only M33 and IC 10 have proper motions. We use the line-of-sight velocities and distances of the satellite galaxies to estimate the mass of M31 within 300 kpc as M300 = 1.4 +/- 0.4 × 1012Msolar assuming isotropy. There is only a modest dependence on anisotropy, with the mass varying between 1.3 × 1012 and 1.6 × 1012Msolar. Incorporating the proper motion data set does not change the results significantly. Given the uncertainties, we conclude that the satellite data by themselves yield no reliable insights into which of the two galaxies is actually the more massive.  Leo I has long been known to dominate mass estimates for the Milky Way due to its substantial distance and line-of-sight velocity. We find that And XII and And XIV similarly dominate the estimated mass of M31. As such, we repeat the calculations without these galaxies, in case they are not bound - although on the balance of the evidence, we favour their inclusion in mass calculations.},

@article{Conroy:2009,
	Abstract = {The stellar masses, mean ages, metallicities, and star formation histories of galaxies are now commonly estimated via stellar population synthesis (SPS) techniques. SPS relies on stellar evolution calculations from the main sequence to stellar death, stellar spectral libraries, phenomenological dust models, and stellar initial mass functions (IMFs) to translate the evolution of a multimetallicity, multi-age set of stars into a prediction for the time-evolution of the integrated light from that set of stars. Each of these necessary inputs carries significant uncertainties that have until now received little systematic attention. The present work is the first in a series that explores the impact of uncertainties in key phases of stellar evolution and the IMF on the derived physical properties of galaxies and the expected luminosity evolution for a passively evolving set of stars. A Monte Carlo Markov Chain approach is taken to fit near-UV through near-IR photometry of a representative sample of low- and high-redshift galaxies with this new SPS model. Significant results include the following. (1) Including uncertainties in stellar evolution, stellar masses at z ~ 0 carry errors of ~0.3 dex at 95% CL with little dependence on luminosity or color, while at z ~ 2, the masses of bright red galaxies are uncertain at the ~0.6 dex level. (2) Either current stellar evolution models, current observational stellar libraries, or both, do not adequately characterize the metallicity-dependence of the thermally pulsating AGB phase. (3) Conservative estimates on the uncertainty of the slope of the IMF in the solar neighborhood imply that luminosity evolution per unit redshift is uncertain at the ~0.4 mag level in the K band, which is a substantial source of uncertainty for interpreting the evolution of galaxy populations across time. Any possible evolution in the IMF, as suggested by several independent lines of evidence, will only exacerbate this problem. (4) Assuming a distribution of stellar metallicities within a galaxy, rather than a fixed value as is usually assumed, can yield important differences when considering bands blueward of V, but is not a concern for redder bands. Spectroscopic information may alleviate some of these concerns, though uncertainties in the stellar spectral libraries and the importance of nonsolar abundance ratios have not yet been systematically investigated in the SPS context.},

These objects, which include 13 spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia at z>=1, were discovered during 14 epochs of reimaging of the GOODS fields North and South over 2 yr with the Advanced Camera for Surveys on  HST. Together with a recalibration of our previous HST-discovered SNe Ia, the full sample of 23 SNe Ia at z>=1 provides the highest redshift sample known. Combining these data with previous SN Ia data sets, we measured H(z) at discrete, uncorrelated epochs, reducing the uncertainty of H(z>1) from 50% to under 20%, strengthening the evidence for a cosmic jerk-the transition from deceleration in the past to acceleration in the present. The unique leverage of the HST high-redshift SNe Ia provides the first meaningful constraint on the dark energy equation-of-state parameter at z>=1. The result remains consistent with a cosmological constant [w(z)=-1] and rules out rapidly evolving dark energy (dw/dz>>1). The defining property of dark energy, its negative pressure, appears to be present at z>1, in the epoch preceding acceleration, with ~98% confidence in our primary fit. Moreover, the z>1 sample-averaged spectral energy distribution is consistent with that of the typical SN Ia over the last 10 Gyr, indicating that any spectral evolution of the properties of SNe Ia with redshift is still below our detection threshold.  Based on observations with the NASA/ESA  Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI), which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA), Inc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555.},

	Abstract = {We describe a sampling method to estimate the polarized cosmic microwave background (CMB) signal from observed maps of the sky. We use a Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm to estimate the polarized CMB map, containing Q and U Stokes parameters at each pixel, and its covariance matrix. These can be used as inputs for cosmological analyses. The polarized sky signal is parameterized as the sum of three components: CMB, synchrotron emission, and thermal dust emission. The polarized Galactic components are modeled with spatially varying power-law spectral indices for the synchrotron, and a fixed power law for the dust, and their component maps are estimated as by-products. We apply the method to simulated low-resolution maps with pixels of side 7.2 deg, using diagonal and full noise realizations drawn from the WMAP noise matrices. The CMB maps are recovered with goodness of fit consistent with errors. Computing the likelihood of the E-mode power in the maps as a function of optical depth to reionization, tau, for fixed temperature anisotropy power, we recover tau = 0.091 $\pm$ 0.019 for a simulation with input tau = 0.1, and mean tau = 0.098 averaged over 10 simulations. A "null" simulation with no polarized CMB signal has maximum likelihood consistent with tau = 0. The method is applied to the five-year WMAP data, using the K, Ka, Q, and V channels. We find tau = 0.090 $\pm$ 0.019, compared to tau = 0.086 $\pm$ 0.016 from the template-cleaned maps used in the primary WMAP analysis. The synchrotron spectral index, beta, averaged over high signal-to-noise pixels with standard deviation sigma(beta) < 0.25, but excluding ~6% of the sky masked in the Galactic plane, is -3.03 $\pm$ 0.04. This estimate does not vary significantly with Galactic latitude, although includes an informative prior.  WMAP is the result of a partnership between Princeton University and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Scientific guidance is provided by the WMAP Science Team.},

	Abstract = {We present a new catalog of photometric and spectroscopic data on M31 globular clusters (GCs). The catalog includes new optical and near-infrared photometry for a substantial fraction of the 435 clusters and cluster candidates. We use these data to determine the reddening and intrinsic colors of individual clusters, and we find that the extinction laws in the Galaxy and M31 are not significantly different. There are significant (up to 0.2 mag in V-K) offsets between the clusters' intrinsic colors and simple stellar population colors predicted by population synthesis models; we suggest that these are due to systematic errors in the models. The distributions of M31 clusters' metallicities and metallicity-sensitive colors are bimodal, with peaks at [Fe/H]~-1.4 and -0.6. The distribution of V-I is often bimodal in elliptical galaxies' globular cluster systems, but it is not sensitive enough to metallicity to show bimodality in M31 and Galactic cluster systems. The radial distribution and kinematics of the two M31 metallicity groups imply that they are analogs of the Galactic ``halo'' and ``disk/bulge'' cluster systems. The globular clusters in M31 have a small radial metallicity gradient, suggesting that some dissipation occurred during the formation of the globular cluster system. The lack of correlation between cluster luminosity and metallicity in M31 GCs shows that self-enrichment is not important in GC formation. Work reported here based on observations made with the Multiple Mirror Telescope, a joint facility of the Smithsonian Institution and the University of Arizona.},

	Abstract = {A simple analytic mode of the response of dark matter halos to the dissipative infall of the luminous material to form an exponential disk is used to explore the dependence of the final rotation curves on all the relevant parameters: the ratio of the dissipative baryonic mass to the total galaxy mass, including dark matter; the ratio of the disk exponential scale length to the truncation radius; the core radius of the isothermal halo in the absence of dissipation; and the dimensionless angular momentum parameter. Particular attention is given to the final rotation curves expected in the tidal torque theory of angular momentum, in which (lambda) is about 0.05. For F of about 0.05 the dispersion in lambda expected in the tidal torque theory, 0.02-0.1, leads to rotation curves for bright galaxies whose systematics are much like those of galaxies for which H I data are available when consistent baryonic disk-scale lengths are used throughout. The mass inside R(H) exhibits a spread of values consistent with observations except possibly for the smallest galaxies, which may have suffered significant loss.},

	Abstract = {Varied evidence suggests that galaxies consist of roughly 10 percent baryonic matter by mass and that baryons sink dissipatively by about a factor of 10 in. radius during galaxy formation. It is shown that such infall strongly perturbs the underlying dark matter distribution, pulling it inward and creating cores that are considerably smaller and denser than would have evolved without dissipation. Any discontinuity between the baryonic and dark matter mass distributions is smoothed out by the coupled motions of the two components. If dark halos have large core radii in the absence of dissipation, the above infall scenario yields rotation curves that are flat over large distances, in agreement with observations of spiral galaxies. Such large dissipationless cores may plausibly result from large internal kinetic energy in protogalaxies at maximum expansion, perhaps as a result of subclustering, tidal effects, or anisotropic collapse.},

Two branches (A and B) of the Sagittarius stream are clearly visible in an RGB composite image created from three magnitude slices, and there is also evidence for a still more distant wrap behind the A branch.

	Abstract = {Two studies have recently reported the discovery of pronounced halo substructure in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) commissioning data. Here we show that this halo substructure is, almost in its entirety, due to the expected tidal stream torn off the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy during the course of its many close encounters with the Milky Way. This interpretation makes strong predictions on the kinematics and distances of these stream stars. Comparison of the structure in old horizontal branch stars, detected by the SDSS team, with the carbon star structure discovered in our own survey, indicates that this halo stream is of comparable age to the Milky Way. It would appear that the Milky Way and the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy have been a strongly interacting system for most of their existence. Once complete, the SDSS will provide a unique data set with which to constrain the dynamical evolution of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy; it will also strongly constrain the mass distribution of the outer Milky Way.},

Good agreement with the data is obtained for a Zeldovich spectrum of primordial fluctuations.},

If a certain modified version of the Newtonian dynamics is used to describe the motion of bodies in a gravitational field (of a galaxy, say), the observational results are reproduced with no need to assume hidden mass in appreciable quantities. Various characteristics of galaxies result with no further assumptions. The basis of the modification is the assumption that in the limit of small acceleration a very low a0, the acceleration of a particle at distance r from a mass M satisfies approximately a2/a0 ≈ MGr-2, where a0 is a constant of the dimensions of an acceleration.},

	Abstract = {We study dark matter halo density profiles in a high-resolution N-body simulation of a LambdaCDM cosmology. Our statistical sample contains ~5000 haloes in the range 1011-1014h-1Msolar, and the resolution allows a study of subhaloes inside host haloes. The profiles are parametrized by an NFW form with two parameters, an inner radius rs and a virial radius Rvir, and we define the halo concentration cvir≡Rvirrs. First, we find that, for a given halo mass, the redshift dependence of the median concentration is cvir~(1+z)-1. This corresponds to rs(z)~constant, and is contrary to earlier suspicions that cvir does not vary much with redshift. The implications are that high-redshift galaxies are predicted to be more extended and dimmer than expected before. Secondly, we find that the scatter in halo profiles is large, with a 1sigma Delta(logcvir)=0.18 at a given mass, corresponding to a scatter in maximum rotation velocities of DeltaVmaxVmax=0.12. We discuss implications for modelling the Tully-Fisher relation, which has a smaller reported intrinsic scatter. Thirdly, subhaloes and haloes in dense environments tend to be more concentrated than isolated haloes, and show a larger scatter. These results suggest that cvir is an essential parameter for the theory of galaxy modelling, and we briefly discuss implications for the universality of the Tully-Fisher relation, the formation of low surface brightness galaxies, and the origin of the Hubble sequence. We present an improved analytic treatment of halo formation that fits the measured relations between halo parameters and their redshift dependence, and can thus serve semi-analytic studies of galaxy formation.},

	Abstract = {The Hypervelocity Star survey presents the currently largest sample of radial velocity measurements of halo stars out to 80 kpc. We apply spherical Jeans modeling to these data in order to derive the mass profile of the Galaxy. We restrict the analysis to distances larger than 25 kpc from the Galactic center, where the density profile of halo stars is well approximated by a single power law with logarithmic slope between -3.5 and -4.5. With this restriction, we also avoid the complication of modeling a flattened Galactic disk. In the range 25 < r < 80 kpc, the radial velocity dispersion declines remarkably little; a robust measure of its logarithmic slope is between -0.05 and -0.1. The circular velocity profile also declines remarkably little with radius. The allowed range of V_c(80 kpc) lies between 175 and 231 km/s, with the most likely value 193 km/s. Compared with the value at the solar location, the Galactic circular velocity declines by less than 20% over an order of magnitude in radius. Such a flat profile requires a massive and extended dark matter halo. The mass enclosed within 80 kpc is 6.9(+3.0-1.2) 10^11 Msun. Our sample of radial velocities is large enough that the biggest uncertainty in the mass is not statistical but systematic, dominated by the density slope and anisotropy of the tracer population. Further progress requires modeling observed datasets within realistic simulations of galaxy formation.},

	Abstract = {The quadrupolar component of the gravitational field due to neighboring galaxies at the barycenter of the Local Group is estimated. The tidal effect consists of an almost equal compression and extension along two principal axes, and of almost no effect along the third. The positive axis of the quadrupole component is aligned with the dipole component for galaxies within 10 Mpc of the Local Group. The nature of the binary orbit of the Andromeda galaxy and the Milky Way in the presence of this tidal field is investigated, and possible orbits are suggested. Though the tidal effects are appreciably strong, they hardly affect the mass of the Local Group derived from timing arguments. The direction along which Andromeda seems to have emerged from the Big Bang indicates that it was responsible for the orbit of the Magellanic Clouds about the Galaxy. The proper motion of Andromeda is predicted.},

@article{Gillessen:2009,
	Abstract = {We present the results of 16 years of monitoring stellar orbits around the massive black hole in the center of the Milky Way, using high-resolution near-infrared techniques. This work refines our previous analysis mainly by greatly improving the definition of the coordinate system, which reaches a long-term astrometric accuracy of ≈300 muas, and by investigating in detail the individual systematic error contributions. The combination of a long-time baseline and the excellent astrometric accuracy of adaptive optics data allows us to determine orbits of 28 stars, including the star S2, which has completed a full revolution since our monitoring began. Our main results are: all stellar orbits are fit extremely well by a single-point-mass potential to within the astrometric uncertainties, which are now ≈6× better than in previous studies. The central object mass is (4.31\, \pm\, 0.06|_\mathrm{stat}\,\pm\, 0.36|_{R_0})\times 10^6 M_\odot, where the fractional statistical error of 1.5% is nearly independent from R 0, and the main uncertainty is due to the uncertainty in R 0. Our current best estimate for the distance to the Galactic center is R 0 = 8.33 $\pm$ 0.35 kpc. The dominant errors in this value are systematic. The mass scales with distance as (3.95 $\pm$ 0.06) × 106(R 0/8 kpc)2.19 M sun. The orientations of orbital angular momenta for stars in the central arcsecond are random. We identify six of the stars with orbital solutions as late-type stars, and six early-type stars as members of the clockwise-rotating disk system, as was previously proposed. We constrain the extended dark mass enclosed between the pericenter and apocenter of S2 at less than 0.066, at the 99% confidence level, of the mass of Sgr A*. This is two orders of magnitudes larger than what one would expect from other theoretical and observational estimates.},

	Abstract = {We report new precision measurements of the properties of our Galaxy's supermassive black hole. Based on astrometric (1995-2007) and radial velocity (RV; 2000-2007) measurements from the W. M. Keck 10 m telescopes, a fully unconstrained Keplerian orbit for the short-period star S0-2 provides values for the distance (R0) of 8.0+/-0.6 kpc, the enclosed mass (Mbh) of 4.1+/-0.6×106 Msolar, and the black hole's RV, which is consistent with zero with 30 km s-1 uncertainty. If the black hole is assumed to be at rest with respect to the Galaxy (e.g., has no massive companion to induce motion), we can further constrain the fit, obtaining R0=8.4+/-0.4 kpc and Mbh=4.5+/-0.4×106 Msolar. More complex models constrain the extended dark mass distribution to be less than 3-4×105 Msolar within 0.01 pc, ~100 times higher than predictions from stellar and stellar remnant models. For all models, we identify transient astrometric shifts from source confusion (up to 5 times the astrometric error) and the assumptions regarding the black hole's radial motion as previously unrecognized limitations on orbital accuracy and the usefulness of fainter stars. Future astrometric and RV observations will remedy these effects. Our estimates of R0 and the Galaxy's local rotation speed, which it is derived from combining R0 with the apparent proper motion of Sgr A*, (theta0=229+/-18 km s-1), are compatible with measurements made using other methods. The increased black hole mass found in this study, compared to that determined using projected mass estimators, implies a longer period for the innermost stable orbit, longer resonant relaxation timescales for stars in the vicinity of the black hole and a better agreement with the Mbh-sigma relation.},

	Abstract = {We report on the discovery of three new dwarf galaxies in the Local Group. These galaxies are found in new CFHT/MegaPrime g,i imaging of the southwestern quadrant of M31, extending our extant survey area to include the majority of the southern hemisphere of M31's halo out to 150 kpc. All these galaxies have stellar populations which appear typical of dwarf spheroidal (dSph) systems. The first of these galaxies, Andromeda XVIII, is the most distant Local Group dwarf discovered in recent years, at ~1.4 Mpc from the Milky Way (~600 kpc from M31). The second galaxy, Andromeda XIX, a satellite of M31, is the most extended dwarf galaxy known in the Local Group, with a half-light radius of rh~1.7 kpc. This is approximately an order of magnitude larger than the typical half-light radius of many Milky Way dSphs, and reinforces the difference in scale sizes seen between the Milky Way and M31 dSphs (such that the M31 dwarfs are generally more extended than their Milky Way counterparts). The third galaxy, Andromeda XX, is one of the faintest galaxies so far discovered in the vicinity of M31, with an absolute magnitude of order MV~-6.3. Andromeda XVIII, XIX, and XX highlight different aspects of, and raise important questions regarding, the formation and evolution of galaxies at the extreme faint end of the luminosity function. These findings indicate that we have not yet sampled the full parameter space occupied by dwarf galaxies, although this is an essential prerequisite for successfully and consistently linking these systems to the predicted cosmological dark matter substructure.},

	Abstract = {One hundred and nine new globular cluster candidates around M31 have been identified on the Canada-France-Hawaii telescope (CFHT) prime-focus slitless spectra plates. All previously recognized clusters (Sargent, et al., 1977; Vetesnick, 1962; and Battistini et al., 1980) were examined on the plates, and a compilation made of 509 objects which have the appearance and spectra of globular clusters. Of these objects, 408 have colors typical of globular clusters in the Galaxy. Methods were devised to estimate the core radii and intrinsic colors of most of the 509 clusters. The characteristics of the globular cluster systems of M31 and the Galaxy are very similar. In particular, the radial frequency distributions and the core radii distributions of the two systems are virtually identical. The mean luminosity of globular clusters decreases significantly with increasing galactocentric distance; the clusters with projected distances from the nucleus greater than 10 kpc are, in the mean, 0.7 mag fainter than those closer to the center. There is no evidence of a radial color gradient in the data, which extend, however, to only about 25 kpc, mainly along the major axis.},

	Abstract = {We review the current theory of how galaxies form within the cosmological framework provided by the cold dark matter paradigm for structure formation. Beginning with the pre-galactic evolution of baryonic material we describe the analytical and numerical understanding of how baryons condense into galaxies, what determines the structure of those galaxies and how internal and external processes (including star formation, merging, active galactic nuclei etc.) determine their gross properties and evolution. Throughout, we highlight successes and failings of current galaxy formation theory. We include a review of computational implementations of galaxy formation theory and assess their ability to provide reliable modelling of this complex phenomenon. We finish with a discussion of several "hot topics" in contemporary galaxy formation theory and assess future directions for this field.},

@article{Bell:2001,
	Abstract = {We have used a suite of simplified spectrophotometric spiral galaxy evolution models to argue that there are substantial variations in stellar mass-to-light (M/L) ratios within and among galaxies, amounting to factors of between 3 and 7 in the optical and factors of 2 in the near-infrared. Our models show a strong correlation between stellar M/L and the optical colors of the integrated stellar populations. Under the assumption of a universal spiral galaxy initial mass function (IMF), relative trends in model stellar M/L with color are robust to uncertainties in stellar population and galaxy evolution modeling, including the effects of modest bursts of star formation. Errors in the dust-reddening estimates do not strongly affect the final derived stellar masses of a stellar population. We examine the observed maximum disk stellar M/L ratios of a sample of spiral galaxies with accurate rotation curves and optical and near-infrared luminosity profiles. From these observed maximum disk M/L ratios we conclude that a Salpeter IMF has too many low-mass stars per unit luminosity but that an IMF similar to the Salpeter IMF at the high-mass end with less low-mass stars (giving stellar M/L ratios 30% lower than the Salpeter value) is consistent with the maximum disk constraints. Trends in observed maximum disk stellar M/L ratios with color provide a good match to the predicted model relation, suggesting that the spiral galaxy stellar IMF is universal and that a fraction of (particularly high surface brightness) spiral galaxies may be close to maximum disk. We apply the model trends in stellar M/L ratio with color to the Tully-Fisher (T-F) relation. We find that the stellar mass T-F relation is relatively steep, has modest scatter, and is independent of the passband and color used to derive the stellar masses, again lending support for a universal IMF. The difference in slope between the optical (especially blue) and near-infrared T-F relations is due to the combined effects of dust attenuation and stellar M/L variations with galaxy mass. Assuming the Hubble Space Telescope Key Project distance to the Ursa Major Cluster and neglecting the (uncertain) molecular gas fraction, we find that the baryonic T-F relation takes the form Mbaryon~V3.5 (with random and systematic 1 sigma slope errors of ~0.2 each) when using a bisector fit and rotation velocities derived from the flat part of the rotation curve. Since we have normalized the stellar M/L ratios to be as high as can possibly be allowed by maximum disk constraints, the slope of the baryonic T-F relation will be somewhat shallower than 3.5 if all disks are substantially submaximal.},

	Abstract = {We use the very large Millennium Simulation of the concordance Lambda cold dark matter cosmogony to calibrate the bias and error distribution of Timing Argument estimators of the masses of the Local Group and of the Milky Way. From a large number of isolated spiral-spiral pairs similar to the Milky Way/Andromeda system, we find the interquartile range of the ratio of timing mass to true mass to be a factor of 1.8, while the 5 and 95 per cent points of the distribution of this ratio are separated by a factor of 5.7. Here, we define true mass as the sum of the `virial' masses, M200, of the two dominant galaxies. For present best values of the distance and approach velocity of Andromeda, this leads to a median likelihood estimate of the true mass of the Local Group of 5.27 × 1012Msolar or logMLG/Msolar = 12.72, with an interquartile range of [12.58, 12.83] and a 5-95 per cent range of [12.26, 13.01]. Thus, a 95 per cent lower confidence limit on the true mass of the Local Group is 1.81 × 1012Msolar. A timing estimate of the Milky Way's mass based on the large recession velocity observed for the distant satellite Leo I works equally well, although with larger systematic uncertainties. It gives an estimated virial mass for the Milky Way of 2.43 × 1012Msolar with a 95 per cent lower confidence limit of 0.80 × 1012Msolar.},

	Abstract = {The authors present full two-dimensional photographic photometry of the nearby spiral galaxy M31 in various colors. They describe the reduction and calibration of the data, as well as a method used to remove the thousands of foreground stars that contaminate the image of the galaxy. Extensive comparisons of these data with published photometric scans show that the blue light intensity of the galaxy is reliable measured out to about 20 kpc radius. Color maps with a typical uncertainty between 0.1 and 0.2 mag were obtained over the main part of the bulge and disk out to 14 kpc radius. Tables listing the intensity and color profiles along the principal axes of the galaxy are presented, together with global profiles in U, B, V, and R out to 24 kpc radius. Two-dimensional color maps, smoothed to a resolution of 40arcsec, show the major dust lanes and a relatively bluer color in the ring of Population I material around 10 kpc radius. The colors are characteristic for an old stellar population. The isophotes of the dwarf elliptical companion NGC 205 are strongly twisted, suggesting tidal interaction between the elliptical and M31.},

@article{Wolf:2010,
	Abstract = {We derive an accurate mass estimator for dispersion-supported stellar systems and demonstrate its validity by analysing resolved line-of-sight velocity data for globular clusters, dwarf galaxies and elliptical galaxies. Specifically, by manipulating the spherical Jeans equation we show that the mass enclosed within the 3D deprojected half-light radius r1/2 can be determined with only mild assumptions about the spatial variation of the stellar velocity dispersion anisotropy as long as the projected velocity dispersion profile is fairly flat near the half-light radius, as is typically observed. We find M1/2 = 3 G-1< sigma2los > r1/2 ~= 4 G-1< sigma2los > Re, where < sigma2los > is the luminosity-weighted square of the line-of-sight velocity dispersion and Re is the 2D projected half-light radius. While deceptively familiar in form, this formula is not the virial theorem, which cannot be used to determine accurate masses unless the radial profile of the total mass is known a priori. We utilize this finding to show that all of the Milky Way dwarf spheroidal galaxies (MW dSphs) are consistent with having formed within a halo of a mass of approximately 3 × 109 Msolar, assuming a Lambda cold dark matter cosmology. The faintest MW dSphs seem to have formed in dark matter haloes that are at least as massive as those of the brightest MW dSphs, despite the almost five orders of magnitude spread in luminosity between them. We expand our analysis to the full range of observed dispersion-supported stellar systems and examine their dynamical I-band mass-to-light ratios UpsilonI1/2. The UpsilonI1/2 versus M1/2 relation for dispersion-supported galaxies follows a U shape, with a broad minimum near UpsilonI1/2 ~= 3 that spans dwarf elliptical galaxies to normal ellipticals, a steep rise to UpsilonI1/2 ~= 3200 for ultra-faint dSphs and a more shallow rise to UpsilonI1/2 ~= 800 for galaxy cluster spheroids.},

	Abstract = {In hierarchical cosmological models, galaxies grow in mass through the continual accretion of smaller ones. The tidal disruption of these systems is expected to result in loosely bound stars surrounding the galaxy, at distances that reach $10 - 100$ times the radius of the central disk. The number, luminosity and morphology of the relics of this process provide significant clues to galaxy formation history, but obtaining a comprehensive survey of these components is difficult because of their intrinsic faintness and vast extent. Here we report a panoramic survey of the Andromeda galaxy (M31). We detect stars and coherent structures that are almost certainly remnants of dwarf galaxies destroyed by the tidal field of M31. An improved census of their surviving counterparts implies that three-quarters of M31's satellites brighter than $M_V < -6$ await discovery. The brightest companion, Triangulum (M33), is surrounded by a stellar structure that provides persuasive evidence for a recent encounter with M31. This panorama of galaxy structure directly confirms the basic tenets of the hierarchical galaxy formation model and reveals the shared history of M31 and M33 in the unceasing build-up of galaxies.},

	Abstract = {The present study of the rotation and velocity dispersion fields of the stellar component of the bulge region of M31 indicates that the Fourier quotient technique is useful in the determination of velocities and their dispersions, even on photographic spectra. An apparent symmetry is found to be present in the rotation curves in the region whose R value is less than 10 arcsec. The position of discrete dust features shown on enhanced photography correlates with small perturbations in the rotation curves. The gas and stellar components have different intrinsic rotational velocities in the bulge, suggesting only weak coupling, if any, between the two systems. No clear dynamical evidence is noted for the presence of a barlike structure in the bulge of M31.},

	Abstract = {(Abridged) We present the angular power spectra derived from the 7-year maps and discuss the cosmological conclusions that can be inferred from WMAP data alone. The third acoustic peak in the TT spectrum is now well measured by WMAP. In the context of a flat LambdaCDM model, this improvement allows us to place tighter constraints on the matter density from WMAP data alone, and on the epoch of matter-radiation equality, The temperature-polarization (TE) spectrum is detected in the 7-year data with a significance of 21 sigma, compared to 13 sigma with the 5-year data. The low-l EE spectrum, a measure of the optical depth due to reionization, is detected at 5.5 sigma significance when averaged over l = 2-7. The BB spectrum, an important probe of gravitational waves from inflation, remains consistent with zero. The upper limit on tensor modes from polarization data alone is a factor of 2 lower with the 7-year data than it was using the 5-year data (Komatsu et al. 2010). We test the parameter recovery process for bias and find that the scalar spectral index, ns, is biased high, but only by 0.13 sigma, while the remaining parameters are biased by < 0.15 sigma. The improvement in the third peak measurement leads to tighter lower limits from WMAP on the number of relativistic degrees of freedom (e.g., neutrinos) in the early universe: Neff > 2.7 (95% CL). Also, using WMAP data alone, the primordial helium mass fraction is found to be YHe = 0.28+0.14-0.15, and with data from higher-resolution CMB experiments included, we now establish the existence of pre-stellar helium at > 3 sigma (Komatsu et al. 2010).},

	Abstract = {We use Bayesian statistics and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques to construct dynamical models for the spiral galaxy NGC 6503. The constraints include surface brightness (SB) profiles which display a Freeman Type II structure; H I and ionized gas rotation curves; the stellar rotation, which is nearly coincident with the ionized gas curve; and the line of sight stellar dispersion, which displays a sigma-drop at the center. The galaxy models consist of a S{\'e}rsic bulge, an exponential disk with an optional inner truncation and a cosmologically motivated dark halo. The Bayesian/MCMC technique yields the joint posterior probability distribution function for the input parameters, allowing constraints on model parameters such as the halo cusp strength, structural parameters for the disk and bulge, and mass-to-light ratios. We examine several interpretations of the data: the Type II SB profile may be due to dust extinction, to an inner truncated disk, or to a ring of bright stars, and we test separate fits to the gas and stellar rotation curves to determine if the gas traces the gravitational potential. We test each of these scenarios for bar stability, ruling out dust extinction. We also find that the gas likely does not trace the gravitational potential, since the predicted stellar rotation curve, which includes asymmetric drift, is then inconsistent with the observed stellar rotation curve. The disk is well fit by an inner-truncated profile, but the possibility of ring formation by a bar to reproduce the Type II profile is also a realistic model. We further find that the halo must have a cuspy profile with gamma >~ 1; the bulge has a lower M/L than the disk, suggesting a star-forming component in the center of the galaxy; and the bulge, as expected for this late-type galaxy, has a low S{\'e}rsic index with nb ~ 1-2, suggesting a formation history dominated by secular evolution.},

	Abstract = {We report the systematic detection of magnetic fields in massive (M > 5 M$_\odot$) late-type supergiants, using spectropolarimetric observations obtained with ESPaDOnS at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. Our observations reveal detectable Stokes V Zeeman signatures in Least-Squares Deconvolved mean line profiles in one-third of the observed sample of more than 30 stars. The signatures are sometimes complex, revealing multiple reversals across the line. The corresponding longitudinal magnetic field is seldom detected, although our longitudinal field error bars are typically 0.3 G ($1\sigma$). These characteristics suggest topologically complex magnetic fields, presumably generated by dynamo action. The Stokes V signatures of some targets show clear time variability, indicating either rotational modulation or intrinsic evolution of the magnetic field. We also observe a weak correlation between the unsigned longitudinal magnetic field and the CaII K core emission equivalent width of the active G2Iab supergiant $\beta$~Dra and the G8Ib supergiant $\epsilon$~Gem.},

	Abstract = {A major uncertainty in the dynamical history of the Local Group of galaxies originates from the unknown transverse speed of the Andromeda galaxy (M31) relative to the Milky Way. We show that the recent VLBA measurement of the proper motion of Andromeda's satellite, M33, severely constrains the possible values of M31's proper motion. The condition that M33's stellar disk has not been tidally disrupted by either M31 or the Milky Way over the past 10 billion years favors a proper motion amplitude of 100+/-20 km s-1 for M31 with the quadrant of a negative velocity component along right ascension and a positive component along declination strongly ruled out. This inference can be tested by future astrometric measurements with SIM, Gaia, or the SKA. Our results imply that the dark halos of Andromeda and the Milky Way will pass through each other within the next 5-10 billion years.},

	Abstract = {We have identified in the 2MASS database 693 known and candidate globular clusters in M 31. The 2MASS J, H, K magnitudes of these objects have been transformed to the same homogeneous photometric system of existing near infrared photometry of M 31 globulars, finally yielding J, H, K integrated photometry for 279 confirmed M 31 clusters, 406 unconfirmed candidates and 8 objects with controversial classification. Of these objects 529 lacked any previous estimate of their near infrared magnitudes. The newly assembled near infrared dataset has been implemented into a revised version of the Bologna Catalogue of M 31 globulars, with updated optical (UBVRI) photometry taken, when possible, from the most recent sources of CCD photometry available in the literature and transformed to a common photometric system. The final Revised Bologna Catalogue (available in electronic form) is the most comprehensive list presently available of confirmed and candidate M 31 globular clusters, with a total of 1164 entries. In particular, it includes 337 confirmed GCs, 688 GC candidates, 10 objects with controversial classification, 70 confirmed galaxies, 55 confirmed stars, and 4 H II regions lying within ˜3$\,^{\circ}$ from the center of the M 31 galaxy. Using the newly assembled database we show that the V-K color provides a powerful tool to discriminate between M 31 clusters and background galaxies, and we identify a sample of 83 globular cluster candidates, which is not likely to be contaminated by misclassified galaxies.

	Abstract = {In the course of our survey of the outer halo of the Andromeda galaxy we have discovered a remote, possible satellite of that system at a projected 162 kpc (11.7$\,^{\circ}$) radius. The fairly elongated (0.31+/-0.09 ellipticity) dwarf can be fit with a King profile of 1.07 kpc (d/784 kpc) limiting radius, where the satellite distance, d, is estimated at ~630-850 kpc from the tip of the red giant branch. The newfound galaxy, ``Andromeda XIV'' (``And XIV''), distinguishes itself from other Local Group galaxies by its extreme dynamics; Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopy reveals it to have a large heliocentric radial velocity (-481 km s-1), or -206 km s-1 velocity relative to M31. Even at its projected radius And XIV already is at the M31 escape velocity based on the latest M31 mass models. If And XIV is bound to M31, then recent models with reduced M31 virial masses need revision upward. If not bound to M31, then And XIV is just now falling into the Local Group for the first time and represents a dwarf galaxy that formed and spent almost its entire life in isolation.},

	Abstract = {We present the results of a spectroscopic survey of the recently discovered M31 satellites AndXV and AndXVI, lying at projected distances from the centre of M31 of 93 and 130 kpc, respectively. These satellites lie to the south of M31, in regions of the stellar halo which wide-field imaging has revealed as relative voids (compared to the ~degree-scale coherent stream-like structures). Using the Deep Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph mounted on the Keck II telescope, we have defined probable members of these satellites, for which we derive radial velocities as precise as ~6kms-1 down to i ~ 21.5. While the distance to AndXVI remains the same as previously reported (525 +/- 50 kpc), we have demonstrated that the brightest three stars previously used to define the tip of the red giant branch in AndXV are in fact Galactic, and AndXV is actually likely to be much more distant at 770 +/- 70 kpc (compared to the previous 630 kpc), increasing the luminosity from MV ~ -9.4 to -9.8. The AndXV velocity dispersion is resolved with vr = -339+7-6kms-1 and sigmav = 11+7-5kms-1. The AndXVI dispersion is not quite resolved at 1sigma with vr = -385+5-6kms-1 and sigma = 0+10-indef kms-1. Using the photometry of the confirmed member stars, we find metallicities of AndXV (median [Fe/H] = -1.58, interquartile range +/-0.08) and AndXVI (median [Fe/H] = -2.23, interquartile range +/-0.12). Stacking the spectra of the member stars, we find spectroscopic [Fe/H] = -1.8 (-2.1) for AndXV (AndXVI), with an uncertainty of ~0.2 dex in both cases. Our measurements of AndXV reasonably resolve its mass (~108Msolar) and suggest a polar orbit, while the velocity of AndXVI suggests it is approaching the M31 escape velocity given its large M31 centric distance.},

	Abstract = {The velocity distribution of nearby stars (lsim100 pc) contains many overdensities or "moving groups," clumps of comoving stars, that are inconsistent with the standard assumption of an axisymmetric, time-independent, and steady-state Galaxy. We study the age and metallicity properties of the low-velocity moving groups based on the reconstruction of the local velocity distribution in Paper I of this series. We perform stringent, conservative hypothesis testing to establish for each of these moving groups whether it could conceivably consist of a coeval population of stars. We conclude that they do not: the moving groups are neither trivially associated with their eponymous open clusters nor with any other inhomogeneous star formation event. Concerning a possible dynamical origin of the moving groups, we test whether any of the moving groups has a higher or lower metallicity than the background population of thin disk stars, as would generically be the case if the moving groups are associated with resonances of the bar or spiral structure. We find clear evidence that the Hyades moving group has higher than average metallicity and weak evidence that the Sirius moving group has lower than average metallicity, which could indicate that these two groups are related to the inner Lindblad resonance of the spiral structure. Further, we find weak evidence that the Hercules moving group has higher than average metallicity, as would be the case if it is associated with the bar's outer Lindblad resonance. The Pleiades moving group shows no clear metallicity anomaly, arguing against a common dynamical origin for the Hyades and Pleiades groups. Overall, however, the moving groups are barely distinguishable from the background population of stars, raising the likelihood that the moving groups are associated with transient perturbations.},

Our Bayesian approach, symmetric in all observations, is the foundation of a unified framework for object matching, where not only spatial information, but also physical properties, such as colors, redshift, and luminosity, can be considered in a natural way. We provide a practical recipe to implement an efficient recursive algorithm to evaluate the Bayes factor over a set of catalogs with known circular errors in positions. This new methodology is crucial for studies leveraging the synergy of today's multiwavelength observations and to enter the time domain science of the upcoming survey telescopes.},

	Abstract = {The isotropic spherical galaxies are examined to determine specific properties of the systems including the exponential differential energy distribution and the applicability of the Vaucouleurs law. Stellar systems that follow the R exp 1/m law are assumed to have constant mass-to-light ratios and to be spherically symmetrical and isotropic in terms of the velocity dispersion tensor. Calculations are presented of the assumed surface-brightness profile, the spatial luminosity and density, and the line-of-sight velocity dispersion for values of m ranging from 2 to 10. The dimensionless distribution function and the normalized differential energy distribution (DED) are developed and given. The results show that the distribution function is never negative for the systems, and the exponential behavior of the DED is a common property of these stellar systems. The fraction of stellar mass within the Boltzmann range is found to depend on the parameter m and relate to the Vaucouleurs law maximum (m = 4).},

	Abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of a disc galaxy forming in a high-resolution fully cosmological simulation to investigate the nature of the outer regions of discs and their relevance for the disc formation process. Specifically, we focus on the phenomenon of misaligned disc components and find that the outer disc warp is a consequence of the misalignment between the inner disc and the surrounding hot gaseous halo. As the infalling cold gas sinks toward the centre of the galaxy, it is strongly torqued by the hot gas halo. By the time the fresh gas reaches the central disc-forming region its angular momentum is completely aligned with the spin of the hot gas halo. If the spin of the hot gas halo, in turn, is not aligned with that of the inner disc, a misaligned outer disc forms comprised of newly accreted material. The inner and outer components are misaligned with each other because they respond differently to infalling substructure and accretion. The warped disc feeds the main gas disc due to viscous angular momentum losses, but small amounts of star formation in the warp itself form a low-metallicity thick disc. We show that observations of resolved stellar populations in warped galaxies in the local universe could provide evidence for the presence of these processes and therefore indirectly reveal ongoing gas accretion and the existence of hot gas halos.},

	Abstract = {Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques are now widely used for cosmological parameter estimation. Chains are generated to sample the posterior probability distribution obtained following the Bayesian approach. An important issue is how to optimize the efficiency of such sampling and how to diagnose whether a finite-length chain has adequately sampled the underlying posterior probability distribution. We show how the power spectrum of a single such finite chain may be used as a convergence diagnostic by means of a fitting function, and discuss strategies for optimizing the distribution for the proposed steps. The methods developed are applied to current cosmic microwave background and large-scale structure data interpreted using both a pure adiabatic cosmological model and a mixed adiabatic/isocurvature cosmological model including possible correlations between modes. For the latter application, because of the increased dimensionality and the presence of degeneracies, the need for tuning MCMC methods for maximum efficiency becomes particularly acute.},

	Abstract = {Popular models for describing the luminosity-density profiles of dynamically hot stellar systems (e.g. Jaffe, Hernquist, Dehnen) were constructed with the desire to match the deprojected form of an R1/4 light profile. Real galaxies, however, are now known to have a range of different light-profile shapes that scale with mass. Consequently, although highly useful, the above models have implicit limitations, and this is illustrated here through their application to a number of real galaxy density profiles. On the other hand, the analytical density profile given by Prugniel & Simien closely matches the deprojected form of S{\'e}rsic R1/n light profiles - including deprojected exponential light profiles. It is thus applicable for describing bulges in spiral galaxies, dwarf elliptical galaxies, and both ordinary and giant elliptical galaxies. Moreover, the observed S{\'e}rsic quantities define the parameters of the density model. Here we provide simple equations, in terms of elementary and special functions, for the gravitational potential and force associated with this density profile. Furthermore, to match galaxies with partially depleted cores, and better explore the supermassive black hole/galaxy connection, we have added a power-law core to this density profile and derived similar expressions for the potential and force of this hybrid profile. Expressions for the mass and velocity dispersion, assuming isotropy, are also given. These spherical models may also prove appropriate for describing the dark matter distribution in haloes formed from LambdaCDM cosmological simulations.},

	Abstract = {It is generally better to think of galaxies as made of orbits rather than stars. Orbits in most axisymmetric potentials form a three-dimensional continuum. The natural coordinates for the description of this continuum are action integrals. Thus, one is led to the view that the Galaxy inhabits a three-dimensional Euclidean space called action space. In this space the density of stars belonging to each galactic component is given by the distribution function of that component. The structure and evolution of the disk within action space is described. The most natural disk distribution function turns out to violate the classical relation between Oort's constants and the ratio of principal velocity dispersions of disk stars. The Schwarzschild velocity ellipsoid is not a self-similar solution of the equation that governs the diffusion of disk stars through action space if scattering of stars by molecular clouds is the sole cause of the diffusion. A general procedure for choosing the distribution functions of hot components such as the classical populations II is described and illustrated by several worked examples.},

	Abstract = {We study the population of satellite galaxies formed in a suite of N-body/gasdynamical simulations of galaxy formation in a Lambda cold dark matter universe. The simulations resolve nearly 10 most luminous satellites around each host, and probe systems up to six or seven magnitudes fainter than the primary. We find little spatial or kinematic bias between the dark matter and the satellite population. The radius containing half of all satellites is comparable to the half-mass radius of the dark matter component, and the velocity dispersion of the satellites is a good indicator of the virial velocity of the halo; sigmasat/Vvir ~ 0.9 +/- 0.2. Applied to the Local Group, this result suggests that the virial velocity of the Milky Way and M31 might be substantially lower than the rotation speed of their disc components; we find VMWvir ~ 109 +/- 22 km s-1 and VM31vir ~138 +/- 35 km s-1, respectively, compared to VMWrot ~ 220 km s-1 and VM31rot ~ 260 km s-1.Although the uncertainties are large, it is intriguing that both estimates are significantly lower than expected from some semi-analytic models, which predict a smaller difference between Vvir and Vrot. The detailed kinematics of simulated satellites and dark matter are also in good agreement: both components show a steadily decreasing velocity dispersion profile and a mild radial anisotropy in their velocity distribution. By contrast, the stellar halo of the simulated galaxies, which consists predominantly of stellar debris from disrupted satellites, is kinematically and spatially distinct from the population of surviving satellites. This is because the survival of a satellite as a self-bound entity depends sensitively on mass and on time of accretion and surviving satellites are significantly biased toward low-mass systems that have been recently accreted by the galaxy. Our results support recent proposals for the origin of the systematic differences between stars in the Galactic halo and in Galactic satellites: the elusive `building blocks' of the Milky Way stellar halo were on average more massive, and were accreted (and disrupted) earlier than the population of dwarfs that has survived self-bound until thepresent.},

	Abstract = {A simple cosmological model with only six parameters (matter density, Omegamh2, baryon density, Omegabh2, Hubble constant, H0, amplitude of fluctuations, sigma8, optical depth, tau, and a slope for the scalar perturbation spectrum, ns) fits not only the 3 year WMAP temperature and polarization data, but also small-scale CMB data, light element abundances, large-scale structure observations, and the supernova luminosity/distance relationship. Using WMAP data only, the best-fit values for cosmological parameters for the power-law flat Lambda cold dark matter (LambdaCDM) model are (Omegamh2,Omegabh2,h,ns,tau,sigma8)=(0.1277+0.0080-0.0079,0.02229+/-0.00073,0.732+0.031-0.032,0.958+/-0.016,0.089+/-0.030,0.761+0.049-0.048). The 3 year data dramatically shrink the allowed volume in this six-dimensional parameter space. Assuming that the primordial fluctuations are adiabatic with a power-law spectrum, the WMAP data alone require dark matter and favor a spectral index that is significantly less than the Harrison-Zel'dovich-Peebles scale-invariant spectrum (ns=1, r=0). Adding additional data sets improves the constraints on these components and the spectral slope. For power-law models, WMAP data alone puts an improved upper limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, r0.002<0.65 (95% CL) and the combination of WMAP and the lensing-normalized SDSS galaxy survey implies r0.002<0.30 (95% CL). Models that suppress large-scale power through a running spectral index or a large-scale cutoff in the power spectrum are a better fit to the WMAP and small-scale CMB data than the power-law LambdaCDM model; however, the improvement in the fit to the WMAP data is only Deltachi2=3 for 1 extra degree of freedom. Models with a running-spectral index are consistent with a higher amplitude of gravity waves. In a flat universe, the combination of WMAP and the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) data yields a significant constraint on the equation of state of the dark energy, w=-0.967+0.073-0.072. If we assume w=-1, then the deviations from the critical density, OmegaK, are small: the combination of WMAP and the SNLS data implies Omegak=-0.011+/-0.012. The combination of WMAP 3 year data plus the HST Key Project constraint on H0 implies Omegak=-0.014+/-0.017 and OmegaLambda=0.716+/-0.055. Even if we do not include the prior that the universe is flat, by combining WMAP, large-scale structure, and supernova data, we can still put a strong constraint on the dark energy equation of state, w=-1.08+/-0.12. For a flat universe, the combination of WMAP and other astronomical data yield a constraint on the sum of the neutrino masses, Sigmamnu<0.66 eV (95%CL). Consistent with the predictions of simple inflationary theories, we detect no significant deviations from Gaussianity in the CMB maps using Minkowski functionals, the bispectrum, trispectrum, and a new statistic designed to detect large-scale anisotropies in the fluctuations.},

	Abstract = {Parametrizing their light distribution with a Sersic profile, we show that the non-homology in the structure of early-type galaxies has a measurable incidence on their scaling relations. Indeed, the Sersic exponent (i.e., the shape of the photometric profile) correlates with the residuals to the Fundamental Plane. This correlation is in excellent agreement with the theoretical expectation for isotropic galaxies. Adding together the contributions of: (i) the stellar population, (ii) the rotational support, and (iii) the non-homology, fully accounts for the tilt of the Fundamental Plane. This supports the hypothesis of a constant stellar to dynamical mass ratio in the luminous region of early-type galaxies. We confirm the existence of relations between the Sersic exponent, n, and the effective radius or the absolute magnitude, and we give indications for a saturation of this index for the bright (M_B_<-20) or large (r_e_>6.3kpc) galaxies at a value compatible with the de Vaucouleurs law (n=4).},

The properties of the M31 cluster system are very similar to those of the Galactic system. No dependence of metallicity on cluster luminosity is found. The number distribution as a function of metallicity is consistent with that of Galactic clusters. There is evidence for a weak metallicity gradient as a function of projected radius.

	Abstract = {We present evidence for a metal-poor, [Fe/H]~-1.4, sigma=0.2 dex, stellar halo component detectable at radii from 10 to 70 kpc, in our nearest giant spiral neighbor, the Andromeda galaxy. This metal-poor sample underlies the recently discovered extended rotating component and has no detected metallicity gradient. This discovery uses a large sample of 9861 radial velocities of red giant branch (RGB) stars obtained with the Keck II Telescope and DEIMOS spectrograph, with 827 stars with robust radial velocity measurements isolated kinematically to lie in the halo component primarily by windowing out the extended rotating component, which dominates the photometric profile of Andromeda out to <50 kpc (deprojected). The stars lie in 54 spectroscopic fields spread over an 8 deg2 region, and are expected to fairly sample the halo to a radius of ~70 kpc. The halo sample shows no significant evidence for rotation. Fitting a simple model in which the velocity dispersion of the component decreases with radius, we find a central velocity dispersion of 152 km s-1 decreasing by -0.90 km s-1 kpc-1. By fitting a cosmologically motivated NFW halo model to the halo stars we constrain the virial mass of M31 to be greater than 9.0×1011 Msolar with 99% confidence. The properties of this halo component are very similar to that found in our Milky Way, revealing that these roughly equal mass galaxies may have led similar accretion and evolutionary paths in the early universe.},

	Abstract = {We present a spectroscopic survey of the giant stellar stream found in the halo of the Andromeda galaxy. Taken with the DEIMOS multi-object spectrograph on the Keck2 telescope, these data display a narrow velocity dispersion of 11 +/- 3 km s-1, with a steady radial velocity gradient of 245 km s-1 over the 125-kpc radial extent of the stream studied so far. This implies that the Andromeda galaxy possesses a substantial dark matter halo. We fit the orbit of the stream in different galaxy potential models. In a simple model with a composite bulge, disc and halo, where the halo follows a universal profile that is compressed by the formation of the baryonic components, we find that the kinematics of the stream require a total mass inside 125 kpc of M125= 7.5+2.5-1.3× 1011 Msolar, or M125 > 5.4 × 1011 Msolar at the 99 per cent confidence level. This is the first galaxy in which it has been possible to measure the halo mass distribution by such direct dynamical means over such a large distance range. The resulting orbit shows that if M32 or NGC 205 is connected with the stream, they must either trail or lag the densest region of the stream by more than 100 kpc. Furthermore, according to the best-fitting orbit, the stream passes very close to M31, causing its demise as a coherent structure and producing a fan of stars that will pollute the inner halo, thereby confusing efforts to measure the properties of genuine halo populations. Our data show that several recently identified planetary nebulae, which have been proposed as evidence for the existence of a new companion of M31, are likely members of the Andromeda stream.},

	Abstract = {(Abridged) We use N-body simulations to study the effects that a divergent (i.e. "cuspy") dark matter (DM) profile introduces on the tidal evolution of dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs). Our models assume cosmologically-motivated initial conditions where dSphs are DM-dominated systems on eccentric orbits about a host galaxy composed of a dark halo and a baryonic disc. We find that the resilience of dSphs to tidal stripping is extremely sensitive to the halo cuspiness; whereas dwarfs with a cored profile can be easily destroyed by the host disc, those with cusps always retain a bound remnant. For a given halo profile the evolution of the structural parameters as driven by tides is controlled solely by the total amount of mass lost. This information is used to construct a semi-analytic code that simulates the hierarchical build-up of spiral galaxies assuming different halo profiles and disc masses. We find that tidal encounters with discs tend to decrease the average mass of satellites at all galactocentric radii. Interestingly, satellites accreted before re-ionization (z>6), which may be singled out by anomalous metallicity patterns, survive only if haloes are cuspy. We show that the size-mass relation established from Milky Way (MW) dwarfs strongly supports the presence of cusps in the majority of these systems, as cored models systematically underestimate the masses of the known Ultra-Faint dSphs. Our models also indicate that a massive M31 disc may explain why many of its dSphs fall below the size-mass relationship derived from MW dSphs. We use our models to constrain the mass threshold below which star formation is suppressed in DM haloes, finding that luminous satellites must be accreted with masses above 10^8--10^9 M_sol in order to explain the size-mass relation observed in MW dwarfs.},

	Abstract = {The mass of the Galactic dark matter halo is under vivid discussion. A recent study by Xue et al. (2008, ApJ, 684, 1143) revised the Galactic halo mass downward by a factor of ~2 relative to previous work, based on the line-of-sight velocity distribution of ~2400 blue horizontal-branch (BHB) halo stars. The observations were interpreted in a statistical approach using cosmological galaxy formation simulations, as only four of the 6D phase-space coordinates were determined. Here we concentrate on a close investigation of the stars with highest negative radial velocity from that sample. For one star, SDSSJ153935.67+023909.8 (J1539+0239 for short), we succeed in measuring a significant proper motion, i.e. full phase-space information is obtained. We confirm the star to be a Population II BHB star from an independent quantitative analysis of the SDSS spectrum - providing the first NLTE study of any halo BHB star - and reconstruct its 3D trajectory in the Galactic potential. J1539+0239 turns out as the fastest halo star known to date, with a Galactic rest-frame velocity of 694$^{+300}_{-221}$ km/s (full uncertainty range from Monte Carlo error propagation) at its current position. The extreme kinematics of the star allows a significant lower limit to be put on the halo mass in order to keep it bound, of M_halo$\ge1.7_{-1.1}^{+2.3}\times10^{12}$ Msun. We conclude that the Xue et al. results tend to underestimate the true halo mass as their most likely mass value is consistent with our analysis only at a level of 4%. However, our result confirms other studies that make use of the full phase-space information.},

	Abstract = {We use a sample of newly-discovered globular clusters from the Pan-Andromeda Archaeological Survey (PAndAS) in combination with previously-catalogued objects to map the spatial distribution of globular clusters in the M31 halo. At projected radii beyond ~30 kpc, where large coherent stellar streams are readily distinguished in the field, there is a striking correlation between these features and the positions of the globular clusters. Adopting a simple Monte Carlo approach, we test the significance of this association by computing the probability that it could be due to the chance alignment of globular clusters smoothly distributed in the M31 halo. We find the likelihood of this possibility is low, below 1%, and conclude that the observed spatial coincidence between globular clusters and multiple tidal debris streams in the outer halo of M31 reflects a genuine physical association. Our results imply that the majority of the remote globular cluster system of M31 has been assembled as a consequence of the accretion of cluster-bearing satellite galaxies. This constitutes the most direct evidence to date that the outer halo globular cluster populations in some galaxies are largely accreted.},

@article{Martin:2009,
	Abstract = {We present the discovery of two new dwarf galaxies, Andromeda XXI and Andromeda XXII, located in the surroundings of the Andromeda and Triangulum galaxies (M31 and M33). These discoveries stem from the first year data of the Pan-Andromeda Archaeological Survey, a photometric survey of the M31/M33 group conducted with the Megaprime/MegaCam Wide-Field Camera mounted on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. Both satellites appear as spatial overdensities of stars which, when plotted in a color-magnitude diagram, follow metal-poor, [Fe/H] = -1.8, red giant branches at the distance of M31/M33. Andromeda XXI is a moderately bright dwarf galaxy (MV = -9.9 $\pm$ 0.6), albeit with low surface brightness, emphasizing again that many relatively luminous M31 satellites still remain to be discovered. It is also a large satellite, with a half-light radius close to 1 kpc, making it the fourth largest Local Group dwarf spheroidal galaxy after the recently discovered Andromeda XIX, Andromeda II, and Sagittarius around the Milky Way, and supports the trend that M31 satellites are larger than their Milky Way counterparts. Andromeda XXII is much fainter (MV = -6.5 $\pm$ 0.8) and lies a lot closer in projection to M33 than it does to M31 (42 versus 224 kpc), suggesting that it could be the first Triangulum satellite to be discovered. Although this is a very exciting possibility in the context of a past interaction of M33 with M31 and the fate of its satellite system, a confirmation will have to await a good distance estimate to confirm its physical proximity to M33. Along with the dwarf galaxies found in previous surveys of the M31 surroundings, these two new satellites bring the number of dwarf spheroidal galaxies in this region to 20.  Based on observations obtained with MegaPrime/MegaCam, a joint project of CFHT and CEA/DAPNIA, at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) which is operated by the National Research Council (NRC) of Canada, the Institute National des Sciences de l'Univers of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique of France, and the University of Hawaii.},

	Abstract = {The hypothesis that M31 and the Galaxy have almost equal and opposite momenta when seen from the barycenter of the Local Group puts a severe constraint on the component of the sun's motions towards M31. Using this constraint and eliminating distant satellites of Andromeda from the solution, the motion of the sun, as seen from the barycenter, is in galactic coordinates 280 km/sec towards l = 102 deg, b = -5 deg. Using recent more accurate determinations of the sun's motion around the Galaxy which are discussed, the motion of the Galaxy is found to lie 27 + or - 15 deg from the direction of M31 and the total relative velocity of these galaxies is deduced to be 137 + or - 20 km/sec. Better bounds are deduced for the mass of the Local Group.},

The lack of binaries in advanced stages of orbital history may imply that isolated binary galaxies merge rapidly; if the timing argument is indiscriminately applied to all of the binaries (bound and unbound), the timing masses correlate poorly with the measured masses. In light of this analysis, the radial orbit timing mass of the M31 galaxy system is of the order of 50 percent of the two-sphere mass, if the system is bound.},

	Abstract = {We use the Jaffe model as a global mass distribution for the Galaxy and determine the circular velocity upsiloc and the Jaffe radius rj using the satellites of the Galaxy, estimates of the local escape velocity of stars, the constraints imposed by the known rotation curve of the disk, and the Local Group timing model. The models include the systematic uncertainties in the isotropy of the satellite orbits, the form of the stellar distribution function near the escape velocity, and the ellipticity of the M31/Galaxy orbit. If we include the Local Group timing constraint, then Leo I is bound, upsiloc = 220$\pm$30km s-1, and rj = 200 kpc (115 kpc ≲ rj ≲ 360 kpc) at 90% confidence. The satellite orbits are nearly isotropic with beta = 1 -sigma2/theta/sigma2r = 0.2 (-0.5 ≲ beta ≲ 0.6), and the stellar distribution function near the escape velocity is f(ε) ∝ εk with kr = 4.4 (1.6 ≲ kr ≲ 8.5), where kr = k + 5/2. While not an accurate measurement of k, it is consistent with models of violent relaxation (k = 3/2). The mass inside 50 kpc is (4.9$\pm$1.1) × 1011 Msun.  Higher mass models require that M31 is on its second orbit and that the halo is larger than the classical tidal limit of the Galaxy/M31 binary system. Such models must have a significant fraction of the Local Group mass in an extended Local Group halo. Lower mass models require that both M31 and Leo I are unbound, but there is no plausible mechanism to produce observed deviations of M31 and Leo I from their expected velocities in an unbound system. If we do not use the Local Group timing model, the median mass of the Galaxy increases significantly, and the error bars broaden. Using only the satellite, escape velocity, and disk rotation curve constraints, the median mass interior to 50 kpc is 3.9 (5.1), and the 90% confidence interval is 3.2-5.5 (4.0-6.4) without (with) Leo I in units of 1011 Msun. The lower bound without Leo I is 65% of the mass expected for a continuation of a flat rotation curve.},

It is shown that, in all cases, whenever a published result is given with asymmetric uncertainties, the value of the physical quantity of interest is biased with respect to what would be obtained using at best all experimental and theoretical information that contribute to evaluate the combined uncertainty. The probabilistic solution to the problem is provided both in exact and in approximated forms.},

In particular, the CART, the C4.5, the Random Forest and fuzzy logic algorithms are studied and reliable classifiers are developed to distinguish between spiral galaxies, elliptical galaxies or star/unknown galactic objects. Morphology information for the training and testing datasets is obtained from the Galaxy Zoo project while the corresponding photometric and spectra parameters are downloaded from the SDSS DR7 catalogue.},

	Abstract = {Radial velocities of H-alpha emission regions were measured at 1636 points in the arms of Galaxy M31. A Fabry-Perot interference method was used. The lack of significant differences in radial velocity along the nuclear and minor axes indicates that expansion motions are not present. Several features of the rotation curve suggest systematic motions, however: the dispersion of the velocities about the curve is more important than the mean of the observational errors, and previously undetected ridges appear in crossing the N3 and N4 arms of Baade. Results of mass distribution calculations are given.},

	Abstract = {We present an updated analysis of the M31 pixel lensing candidate event OAB-N2 previously reported in Calchi Novati et al. (2009). Here we take advantage of new data both astrometric and photometric. Astrometry: using archival 4m-KPNO and HST/WFPC2 data we perform a detailed analysis on the event source whose result, although not fully conclusive on the source magnitude determination, is confirmed by the following light curve photometry analysis. Photometry: first, unpublished WeCAPP data allows us to confirm OAB-N2, previously reported only as a viable candidate, as a well constrained pixel lensing event. Second, this photometry enables a detailed analysis in the event parameter space including the effects due to finite source size. The combined results of these analyses allow us to put a strong lower limit on the lens proper motion. This outcome favors the MACHO lensing hypothesis over self lensing for this individual event and points the way toward distinguishing between the MACHO and self-lensing hypotheses from larger data sets.},

	Abstract = {Using the Torus radiative transfer code we produce synthetic observations of the 21 cm neutral hydrogen line from an SPH simulation of a spiral galaxy. The SPH representation of the galaxy is mapped onto an AMR grid, and a ray tracing method is used to calculate 21 cm line emission for lines of sight through the AMR grid in different velocity channels and spatial pixels. The result is a synthetic spectral cube which can be directly compared to real observations. We compare our synthetic spectral cubes to observations of M31 and M33 and find good agreement, whereby increasing velocity channels trace the main disc of the galaxy. The synthetic data also show kinks in the velocity across the spiral arms, evidence of non-circular velocities. These are still present even when we blur our data to a similar resolution as the observations, but largely absent in M31 and M33, indicating those galaxies do not contain significant spiral shocks. Thus the detailed velocity structure of our maps better represent previous observations of the grand design spiral M81.},

@article{Chemin:2009,
	Abstract = {We present a new deep 21 cm survey of the Andromeda galaxy, based on high-resolution observations performed with the Synthesis Telescope and the 26 m antenna at the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory. The H I distribution and kinematics of the disk are analyzed and basic dynamical properties are given. The rotation curve is measured out to 38 kpc, showing a nuclear peak at 340 km s-1, a dip at 202 km s-1 around 4 kpc, two distinct flat parts at 264 km s-1 and 230 km s-1, and an increase to 275 km s-1 in the outermost regions. Except for the innermost regions, the axisymmetry of the gas rotation is very good. A very strong warp of the H I disk is evidenced. The central regions appear less inclined than the average disk inclination of 74$\,^{\circ}$, while the outer regions appear more inclined. Mass distribution models by LambdaCDM Navarro-Frenk-White, Einasto or pseudo-isothermal dark matter halos with baryonic components are presented. They fail to reproduce the exact shape of the rotation curve. No significant differences are measured between the various shapes of halo. The dynamical mass of M31 enclosed within a radius of 38 kpc is (4.7 $\pm$ 0.5) × 1011 {\cal M} sun. The dark matter component is almost four times more massive than the baryonic mass inside this radius. A total mass of 1.0 × 1012 {\cal M} sun is derived inside the virial radius. The spectral structure of the observations is very complex, with sometimes up to five H I components detected per spectrum, which is very rarely seen in other galaxies. New H I structures are discovered in the datacube. The most remarkable new features are an external arm and thin H I spurs in the disk outskirts. A relationship between these spurs and outer stellar clumps is evidenced. The external arm is 32 kpc long, lies on the far side of the galaxy, and has no obvious counterpart on the other side of the galaxy. Its kinematics clearly differs from the outer adjacent disk. Both these H I perturbations could result from tidal interactions with galaxy companions like NGC 205.  Observations obtained at the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory (DRAO), operated as a national facility by the National Research Council of Canada.},

@article{Lee:2008,
	Abstract = {We present a kinematic analysis of the globular cluster (GC) system in M31, using the velocity data for 504 GCs including those for 150 GCs in our wide-field survey. The all GC system shows strong rotation, with rotation amplitude of vrot~190 km s-1, and weak rotation persists even for the outermost samples at |Y|>=5 kpc, where Y represents the projected distance from the major axis. The rotation-corrected velocity dispersion for the GC system is estimated to be sigmap,r~130 km s-1, and it increases from sigmap,r~120 km s-1 at |Y|<1 kpc to sigmap,r~150 km s-1 at |Y|>=5 kpc. These results are very similar to those for the metal-poor GCs. This shows that there is a dynamically hot halo in M31 that is rotating but primarily pressure-supported. We have identified 50 ``friendless'' GCs, and they appear to rotate around the major axis of M31. Both metal-rich GCs and metal-poor GCs show strong rotation in the inner region. The rotation for the faint GCs is stronger than that for the bright GCs. We have identified 56 GCs and GC candidates with X-ray detection including 39 GCs with measured velocities. The majority of X-ray-emitting GCs follow the disk rotation. We have derived a rotation curve of M31 using the GCs at |Y|<=0.6 kpc. We have estimated the dynamical mass of M31 using ``Projected Mass Estimator (PME)'' and ``Tracer Mass Estimator (TME)'' as MPME=5.5+0.4-0.3×1011 Msolar out to a radius of ~55 kpc and MTME=19.2+1.4-1.3×1011 Msolar for a radius of ~100 kpc, respectively. We finally discuss the implication of these results and compare the kinematics of GCs with that of planetary nebulae in M31.

	Abstract = {We use a highly homogeneous set of data from 132 early-type galaxies in the Virgo and Fornax clusters in order to study the properties of the globular cluster luminosity function (GCLF). The globular cluster system of each galaxy was studied using a maximum likelihood approach to model the intrinsic GCLF after accounting for contamination and completeness effects. The results presented here update our Virgo measurements and confirm our previous results showing a tight correlation between the dispersion of the GCLF and the absolute magnitude of the parent galaxy. Regarding the use of the GCLF as a standard candle, we have found that the relative distance modulus between the Virgo and Fornax clusters is systematically lower than the one derived by other distance estimators, and in particular it is 0.22mag lower than the value derived from surface brightness fluctuation measurements performed on the same data. From numerical simulations aimed at reproducing the observed dispersion of the value of the turnover magnitude in each galaxy cluster we estimate an intrinsic dispersion on this parameter of 0.21mag and 0.15mag for Virgo and Fornax respectively. All in all, our study shows that the GCLF properties vary systematically with galaxy mass showing no evidence for a dichotomy between giant and dwarf early-type galaxies. These properties may be influenced by the cluster environment as suggested by cosmological simulations.},

	Abstract = {The narrow GD-1 stream of stars, spanning 60$\,^{\circ}$ on the sky at a distance of ~10 kpc from the Sun and ~15 kpc from the Galactic center, is presumed to be debris from a tidally disrupted star cluster that traces out a test-particle orbit in the Milky Way halo. We combine Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) photometry, USNO-B astrometry, and SDSS and Calar Alto spectroscopy to construct a complete, empirical six-dimensional (6D) phase-space map of the stream. We find that an eccentric orbit in a flattened isothermal potential describes this phase-space map well. Even after marginalizing over the stream orbital parameters and the distance from the Sun to the Galactic center, the orbital fit to GD-1 places strong constraints on the circular velocity at the Sun's radius Vc = 224 $\pm$ 13 km s-1 and total potential flattening q Phi = 0.87+0.07 -0.04. When we drop any informative priors on Vc , the GD-1 constraint becomes Vc = 221 $\pm$ 18 km s-1. Our 6D map of GD-1, therefore, yields the best current constraint on Vc and the only strong constraint on q Phi at Galactocentric radii near R ~ 15 kpc. Much, if not all, of the total potential flattening may be attributed to the mass in the stellar disk, so the GD-1 constraints on the flattening of the halo itself are weak: q Phi,halo > 0.89 at 90% confidence. The greatest uncertainty in the 6D map and the orbital analysis stems from the photometric distances, which will be obviated by GAIA.  Based on observations collected at the Centro Astron{\'o}mico Hispano Alem{\'a}n (CAHA) at Calar Alto, operated jointly by the Max-Planck Institut f{\"u}r Astronomie and the Instituto de Astrof{\'\i}sica de Andaluc{\'\i}a (CSIC).},

	Abstract = {We present a three-dimensional reconstruction of the velocity distribution of nearby stars (lsim100 pc) using a maximum likelihood density estimation technique applied to the two-dimensional tangential velocities of stars. The underlying distribution is modeled as a mixture of Gaussian components. The algorithm reconstructs the error-deconvolved distribution function, even when the individual stars have unique error and missing-data properties. We apply this technique to the tangential velocity measurements from a kinematically unbiased sample of 11,865 main-sequence stars observed by the Hipparcos satellite. We explore various methods for validating the complexity of the resulting velocity distribution function, including criteria based on Bayesian model selection and how accurately our reconstruction predicts the radial velocities of a sample of stars from the Geneva-Copenhagen Survey (GCS). Using this very conservative external validation test based on the GCS, we find that there is little evidence for structure in the distribution function beyond the moving groups established prior to the Hipparcos mission. This is in sharp contrast with internal tests performed here and in previous analyses, which point consistently to maximal structure in the velocity distribution. We quantify the information content of the radial velocity measurements and find that the mean amount of new information gained from a radial velocity measurement of a single star is significant. This argues for complementary radial velocity surveys to upcoming astrometric surveys.},

@article{Hogg:2005,
	Abstract = {An algorithm is developed to model the three-dimensional velocity distribution function of a sample of stars using only measurements of each star's two-dimensional tangential velocity. The algorithm works with ``missing data'': it reconstructs the three-dimensional distribution from data (velocity measurements) that all have one dimension that is unmeasured (the radial direction). It also accounts for covariant measurement uncertainties on the tangential velocity components. The algorithm is applied to tangential velocities measured in a kinematically unbiased sample of 11,865 stars taken from the Hipparcos catalog, chosen to lie on the main sequence and have well-measured parallaxes. The local stellar velocity distribution function of each of a set of 20 color-selected subsamples is modeled as a mixture of two three-dimensional Gaussian ellipsoids of arbitrary relative responsibility. In the fitting, one Gaussian (the ``halo'') is fixed at the known mean velocity and velocity variance tensor of the Galaxy halo, and the other (the ``disk'') is allowed to take an arbitrary mean and an arbitrary variance tensor. The mean and variance tensors (commonly known as the ``velocity ellipsoid'') of the disk velocity distribution are both found to be strong functions of stellar color, with long-lived populations showing larger velocity dispersion, slower mean rotation velocity, and smaller vertex deviation than short-lived populations. The local standard of rest (LSR) is inferred in the usual way, and the Sun's motion relative to the LSR is found to be (U,V,W)solar=(10.1,4.0,6.7)+/-(0.5,0.8,0.2) km s-1. Artificial data sets are made and analyzed, with the same error properties as the Hipparcos data, to demonstrate that the analysis is unbiased. The results are shown to be insensitive to the assumption that the velocity distributions are Gaussian.},

	Abstract = {We present new Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopic observations of hundreds of individual stars along the sightline to the first three of the Andromeda (M31) dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies to be discovered, And I, II, and III, and combine them with recent spectroscopic studies by our team of three additional M31 dSphs, And VII, X, and XIV, as a part of the SPLASH Survey (Spectroscopic and Photometric Landscape of Andromeda's Stellar Halo). Member stars of each dSph are isolated from foreground Milky Way dwarf stars and M31 field contamination using a variety of photometric and spectroscopic diagnostics. Our final spectroscopic sample of member stars in each dSph, for which we measure accurate radial velocities with a median uncertainty (random plus systematic errors) of 4-5 km s-1, includes 80 red giants in And I, 95 in And II, 43 in And III, 18 in And VII, 22 in And X, and 38 in And XIV. The sample of confirmed members in the six dSphs is used to derive each system's mean radial velocity, intrinsic central velocity dispersion, mean abundance, abundance spread, and dynamical mass. This combined data set presents us with a unique opportunity to perform the first systematic comparison of the global properties (e.g., metallicities, sizes, and dark matter masses) of one-third of Andromeda's total known dSph population with Milky Way counterparts of the same luminosity. Our overall comparisons indicate that the family of dSphs in these two hosts have both similarities and differences. For example, we find that the luminosity-metallicity relation is very similar between L ~ 105 and 107 L sun, suggesting that the chemical evolution histories of each group of dSphs are similar. The lowest luminosity M31 dSphs appear to deviate from the relation, possibly suggesting tidal stripping. Previous observations have noted that the sizes of M31's brightest dSphs are systematically larger than Milky Way satellites of similar luminosity. At lower luminosities between L = 104 and 106 L sun, we find that the sizes of dSphs in the two hosts significantly overlap and that four of the faintest M31 dSphs are smaller than Milky Way counterparts. The first dynamical mass measurements of six M31 dSphs over a large range in luminosity indicate similar mass-to-light ratios compared to Milky Way dSphs among the brighter satellites, and smaller mass-to-light ratios among the fainter satellites. Combined with their similar or larger sizes at these luminosities, these results hint that the M31 dSphs are systematically less dense than Milky Way dSphs. The implications of these similarities and differences for general understanding of galaxy formation and evolution are summarized.},

	Abstract = {We present the McMaster Unbiased Galaxy Simulations (MUGS), the first 9 galaxies of an unbiased selection ranging in total mass from 5$\times10^{11}$ M$_\odot$ to 2$\times10^{12}$ M$_\odot$ simulated using n-body smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) at high resolution. The simulations include a treatment of low temperature metal cooling, UV background radiation, star formation, and physically motivated stellar feedback. Mock images of the simulations show that the simulations lie within the observed range of relations such as that between color and magnitude and that between brightness and circular velocity (Tully-Fisher). The greatest discrepancy between the simulated galaxies and observed galaxies is the high concentration of material at the center of the galaxies as represented by the centrally peaked rotation curves and the high bulge-to-total ratios of the simulations determined both kinematically and photometrically. This central concentration represents the excess of low angular momentum material that long has plagued morphological studies of simulated galaxies and suggests that higher resolutions and a more accurate description of feedback will be required to simulate more realistic galaxies. Even with the excess central mass concentrations, the simulations suggest the important role merger history and halo spin play in the formation of disks.},

Among others, we outline the Metropolis algorithm and give an overview of existing algorithms for the generation of the phase space of final state particles in high energy collisions.},

	Abstract = {The absolute bolometric luminosity of the point of core helium ignition in old, metal-poor, red giant stars is of roughly constant magnitude, varying only very slightly with mass or metallicity It can thus be used as a standard candle. Here, we review the main difficulties in measuring this location in any real data set and we develop an empirical approach to optimize it for tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) analysis. We go on to present a new algorithm for the identification of the TRGB in nearby metal-poor stellar systems. Our method uses a least-squares fit of a data adaptive slope to the luminosity function in 1-mag windows. This finds the region of the luminosity function that shows the most significant decline in star counts as we go to brighter magnitudes; the base of this decline is attributed as the location of the tip. This technique then allows for the determination of realistic uncertainties which reflect the quality of the luminosity function used, but which are typically ~0.02 mag rms +~0.03 mag systematic, a significant improvement upon previous methods that have used the tip as a standard candle. Finally, we apply our technique to the Local Group spiral galaxy M33 and the dwarf galaxies Andromeda I and II, and derive distance modulii of 24.50 +/- 0.06 mag (794 +/- 23 kpc), 24.33 +/- 0.07 mag (735 +/- 23 kpc) and 24.05 +/- 0.06 mag (645 +/- 19 kpc) respectively. The result for M33 is in excellent agreement with the Cepheid distances to this galaxy, and makes the possibility of a significant amount of reddening in this object unlikely.},

	Abstract = {We present spectroscopic observations of the And XII dwarf spheroidal galaxy using DEIMOS/Keck II, showing it to be moving rapidly through the Local Group (-556 km s-1 heliocentric velocity, -281 km s-1 relative to Andromeda), falling into the Local Group from ~115 kpc beyond Andromeda's nucleus. And XII therefore represents a dwarf galaxy plausibly falling into the Local Group for the first time and never having experienced a dense galactic environment. From Green Bank Telescope observations, a limit on the H I gas mass of <3×103 Msolar suggests that And XII's gas could have been removed prior to experiencing the tides of the Local Group galaxies. Orbit models suggest that the dwarf is close to the escape velocity of M31 for published mass models. And XII is our best direct evidence for the late infall of satellite galaxies, a prediction of cosmological simulations.},

	Abstract = {We present the results of a spectroscopic survey of the recently discovered faint Milky Way satellites Bo{\"o}tes, Ursa Major I, Ursa Major II and Willman 1 (Wil1). Using the DEep Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph mounted on the Keck II telescope, we have obtained samples that contain from ~15 to ~85 probable members of these satellites for which we derive radial velocities precise to a few kms-1 down to i ~ 21-22. About half of these stars are observed with a high enough signal-to-noise ratio to estimate their metallicity to within +/-0.2 dex. The characteristics of all the observed stars are made available, along with those of the Canes Venatici I dwarf galaxy that have been analysed in a companion paper.  From this data set, we show that Ursa Major II is the only object that does not show a clear radial velocity peak. However, the measured systemic radial velocity (vr = 115 +/- 5kms-1) is in good agreement with simulations in which this object is the progenitor of the recently discovered Orphan Stream. The three other satellites show velocity dispersions that make them highly dark matter dominated systems (under the usual assumptions of symmetry and virial equilibrium). In particular, we show that despite its small size and faintness, the Wil1 object is not a globular cluster given its metallicity scatter over -2.0 <~ [Fe/H] <~ -1.0 and is therefore almost certainly a dwarf galaxy or dwarf galaxy remnant. We measure a radial velocity dispersion of only 4.3+2.3-1.3kms-1 around a systemic velocity of -12.3 +/- 2.3kms-1 which implies a mass-to-light ratio of ~700 and a total mass of ~5 × 105Msolar for this satellite, making it the least massive satellite galaxy known to date. Such a low mass could mean that the 107Msolar limit that had until now never been crossed for Milky Way and Andromeda satellite galaxies may only be an observational limit and that fainter, less massive systems exist within the Local Group. However, more modelling and an extended search for potential extratidal stars are required to rule out the possibility that these systems have not been significantly heated by tidal interaction.  The data presented herein were obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation.  E-mail: martin@mpia-hd.mpg.de ‡  Canadian Space Agency Fellow.},

@article{Dehnen:1998,
	Abstract = {From the parallaxes and proper motions of a kinematically unbiased subsample of the Hipparcos Catalogue, we have re-determined as a function of colour the kinematics of main-sequence stars. Whereas the radial and vertical components of the mean heliocentric velocity of stars show no trend with colour, the component in the direction of Galactic rotation nicely follows the asymmetric drift relation, except for stars bluer than B-V=0.1mag. Extrapolating to zero dispersion yields, for the velocity of the Sun with respect to the local standard of rest (LSR) in kms^-1, U_0=10.00+/-0.36 (radially inwards), V_0=5.25+/-0.62 (in the direction of Galactic rotation) and W_0=7.17+/-0.38 (vertically upwards). Parenago's discontinuity is beautifully visible in a plot of velocity dispersion against colour: the dispersion, which is essentially constant for late spectral types, decreases towards early spectral types blueward of B-V~0.61mag. We determine the velocity dispersion tensor sigma^2 as function of colour. The mixed moments involving vertical motion are zero within the errors, while sigma^2_xy is non-zero at about (10kms^-1)^2 independently of colour. The resulting vertex deviations are about 20 deg for early-type stars and 10 deg+/-4 deg for old-disc stars. The persistence of the vertex deviation to late-type stars implies that the Galactic potential is significantly non-axisymmetric at the solar radius. If spiral arms are responsible for the non-axisymmetry, they cannot be tightly wound. Except for stars bluer than B-V=0.1mag, the ratios of the principal velocity dispersions are given by sigma_1:sigma_2:sigma_3~2.2:1.4:1, while the absolute values increase with colour from sigma_1~20kms^-1 at B-V=0.2mag to sigma_1~38kms^-1 at Parenago's discontinuity and beyond. These ratios imply significant heating of the disc by spiral structure and that R_0/R_d~=3 to 3.5, where R_d is the scalelength of the disc.},

Using follow-up imaging data we have estimated its distance and other physical properties. We find that Andromeda X has a dereddened central surface brightness of muV,0~26.7 mag arcsec-2 and a total apparent magnitude of Vtot~16.1, which at the derived distance modulus, (m-M)0~24.12-24.34, yields an absolute magnitude of MV~-8.1+/-0.5 these values are quite comparable to those of Andromeda IX, a previously discovered low-luminosity M31 satellite. The discoveries of Andromeda X and of numerous other extremely faint satellites around M31 and the Milky Way in the past few years suggest that such objects may be plentiful in the Local Group.},

	Abstract = {We present the first spectroscopic analysis of the faint M31 satellite galaxies, AndXI and AndXIII, and a reanalysis of existing spectroscopic data for two further faint companions, And IX and AndXII. By combining data obtained using the DEIMOS spectrograph mounted on the Keck II telescope with deep photometry from the Suprime-Cam instrument on Subaru, we have calculated global properties for the dwarfs, such as systemic velocities, metallicites and half-light radii.We find each dwarf to be very metal poor ([Fe/H] -2 both photometrically and spectroscopically, from their stacked spectrum), and as such, they continue to follow the luminosity-metallicity relationship established with brighter dwarfs. We are unable to resolve a dispersion for And XI due to small sample size and low S/N, but we set a one sigma upper limit of sigma-v <5 km/s. For And IX, And XII and And XIII we resolve velocity dispersions of v=4.5 (+3.4,-3.2), 2.6(+5.1,-2.6) and 9.7(+8.9,-4.5) km/s, and derive masses within the half light radii of 6.2(+5.3,-5.1)x10^6 Msun, 2.4 (+6.5,-2.4)x10^6 Msun and 1.1(+1.4,-0.7)x10^7 Msun respectively. We discuss each satellite in the context of the Mateo relations for dwarf spheroidal galaxies, and the Universal halo profiles established for Milky Way dwarfs (Walker et al. 2009). For both galaxies, this sees them fall below the Universal halo profiles of Walker et al. (2009). When combined with the findings of McConnachie & Irwin (2006a), which reveal that the M31 satellites are twice as extended (in terms of both half-light and tidal radii) as their Milky Way counterparts, these results suggest that the satellite population of the Andromeda system could inhabit halos that are significantly different from those of the Milky Way in terms of their central densities (abridged).},

@article{Martin:2006,
	Abstract = {We present the discovery of three faint dwarf galaxies and a globular cluster in the halo of the Andromeda galaxy (M31), found in our MegaCam survey that spans the southern quadrant of M31, from a projected distance of ~50 to ~150kpc. Though the survey covers 57 deg2, the four satellites lie within 2$\,^{\circ}$ of one another. From the tip of the red giant branch (RGB), we estimate that the globular cluster lies at a distance of 631 +/- 58kpc from the Milky Way and along with a ~100kpc projected distance from M31 we derive a total distance of 175 +/- 55kpc from its host, making it the farthest M31 globular cluster known. It also shows the typical characteristics of a bright globular cluster, with a half-light radius of 2.3 +/- 0.2pc and an absolute magnitude in the V band of MV,0 = -8.5 +/- 0.3. Isochrone fitting reveals that it is dominated by a very old population with a metallicity of [Fe/H] ~ -1.3. The three dwarf galaxies are revealed as overdensities of stars that are aligned along the RGB tracks in their colour-magnitude diagrams. These satellites are all very faint, with absolute magnitudes in the range -7.3 <~ MV,0 <~ -6.4, and show strikingly similar characteristics with metallicities of [Fe/H] ~ -1.4 and half-light radii of ~120 +/- 45pc, making these dwarf galaxies two to three times smaller than the smallest previously known satellites of M31. Given their faintness, their distance is difficult to constrain, but we estimate them to be between 740 and 955kpc which places them well within the virial radius of the host galaxy. The panoramic view of the MegaCam survey can provide an unbiased view of the satellite distribution of the Andromeda galaxy and, extrapolating from its coverage of the halo, we estimate that up to 45 +/- 20 satellites brighter than MV ~ -6.5 should be orbiting M31. Hence faint dwarf galaxies cannot alone account for the missing satellites that are predicted by Lambda cold dark matter models, unless they reside in dark matter minihaloes that are more massive than the typical masses of 107Msolar currently inferred from their central radial velocity dispersion.

	Abstract = {We present a deep photometric survey of the Andromeda galaxy, conducted with the wide-field cameras of CFHT and INT, that covers the inner 50 kpc of the galaxy and the southern quadrant out to ~150 kpc and includes an extension to M33 at >200 kpc. This is the first systematic panoramic study of this very outermost region of galaxies. We detect a multitude of large-scale structures of low surface brightness, including several streams, and two new relatively luminous (MV~-9) dwarf galaxies: And XV and And XVI. Significant variations in stellar populations due to intervening stream-like structures are detected in the inner halo, which is particularly important in shedding light on the mixed and sometimes conflicting results reported in previous studies. Underlying the many substructures lies a faint, smooth, and extremely extended halo component, reaching out to 150 kpc, whose stellar populations are predominantly metal-poor. We find that the smooth halo component in M31 has a radially decreasing profile that can be fitted with a Hernquist model of immense scale radius ~55 kpc, almost 4 times larger than theoretical predictions. Alternatively a power law with SigmaV~R-1.91+/-0.11 can be fitted to the projected profile, similar to the density profile in the Milky Way. If it is symmetric, the total luminosity of this structure is ~109 Lsolar, again similar to the stellar halo of the Milky Way. This vast, smooth, underlying halo is reminiscent of a classical ``monolithic'' model and completely unexpected from modern galaxy formation models. M33 is also found to have an extended metal-poor halo component, which can be fitted with a Hernquist model also of scale radius ~55 kpc. These extended slowly decreasing halos will provide a challenge and strong constraints for further modeling.

In this review, I update the census of Local Group dwarfs based on the most recent distance and radial velocity determinations. I then discuss the detailed properties of this sample, including (a) the integrated photometric parameters and optical structures of these galaxies, (b) the content, nature, and distribution of their interstellar medium (ISM), (c) their heavy-element abundances derived from both stars and nebulae, (d) the complex and varied star-formation histories of these dwarfs, (e) their internal kinematics, stressing the relevance of these galaxies to the "dark matter problem" and to alternative interpretations, and (f) evidence for past, ongoing, and future interactions of these dwarfs with other galaxies in the Local Group and beyond. To complement the discussion and to serve as a foundation for future work, I present an extensive set of basic observational data in tables that summarize much of what we know and still do not know about these nearby dwarfs. Our understanding of these galaxies has grown impressively in the past decade, but fundamental puzzles remain that will keep the Local Group at the forefront of galaxy evolution studies for some time.},

	Abstract = {We present an all-sky catalog of 451 nearby galaxies, each having an individual distance estimate D<~10 Mpc or a radial velocity VLG<550 km s-1. The catalog contains data on basic optical and H I properties of the galaxies, in particular, their diameters, absolute magnitudes, morphological types, circumnuclear region types, optical and H I surface brightnesses, rotational velocities, and indicative mass-to-luminosity and H I mass-to-luminosity ratios, as well as a so-called tidal index, which quantifies the galaxy environment. We expect the catalog completeness to be roughly 70%-80% within 8 Mpc. About 85% of the Local Volume population are dwarf (dIr, dIm, and dSph) galaxies with MB>-17.0, which contribute about 4% to the local luminosity density, and roughly 10%-15% to the local H I mass density. The H I mass-to-luminosity and the H I mass-to-total (indicative) mass ratios increase systematically from giant galaxies toward dwarfs, reaching maximum values about 5 in solar units for the most tiny objects. For the Local Volume disklike galaxies, their H I masses and angular momentum follow Zasov's linear relation, expected for rotating gaseous disks being near the threshold of gravitational instability, favorable for active star formation. We found that the mean local luminosity density exceeds 1.7-2.0 times the global density, in spite of the presence of the Tully void and the absence of rich clusters in the Local Volume. The mean local H I density is 1.4 times its ``global'' value derived from the H I Parkes Sky Survey. However, the mean local baryon density Omegab(<8Mpc)=2.3% consists of only a half of the global baryon density, Omegab=(4.7+/-0.6)% (Spergel et al., published in 2003). The mean-square pairwise difference of radial velocities is about 100 km s-1 for spatial separations within 1 Mpc, increasing to ~300 km s-1 on a scale of ~3 Mpc. also We calculated the integral area of the sky occupied by the neighboring galaxies. Assuming the H I size of spiral and irregular galaxies to be 2.5 times their standard optical diameter and ignoring any evolution effect, we obtain the expected number of the line-of-sight intersections with the H I galaxy images to be dn/dz~0.4, which does not contradict the observed number of absorptions in QSO spectra.},

@article{Courteau:1999,
	Abstract = {New data on the membership of the Local Group (LG) are used, in conjunction with new and improved radial velocity data, to refine the derivation of the motion of the Sun relative to the LG. The Sun is found to be moving with a velocity of V=306+/-18 km s^-1 toward an apex at l=99 deg+/-5 deg and b=-4 deg+/-4 deg. This finding agrees very well with previous analyses, but we discuss the possibility of a bias if the phase-space distribution of LG galaxies is bimodal. The LG radial velocity dispersion is 61+/-8 km s^-1. We use various mass estimators to compute the mass of the LG and the Andromeda subgroup. We find M_LG=(2.3+/-0.6)x10^12 M_solar, from which M/L_V=44+/-12 (in solar units). For an assumed LG age of 14+/-2 Gyr, the radius of an idealized LG zero-velocity surface is r_0=1.18+/-0.15 Mpc. The LG is found to have 35 likely members. Only three of these have (uncertain) distances >~1.0 Mpc from the LG barycenter. Barring new discoveries of low surface brightness dwarfs, this suggests that the LG is more compact and more isolated from its surroundings than previously believed.},

The HiRes experiment consists of two detectors that observe cosmic ray showers via the fluorescence light they emit. HiRes data can be analyzed in monocular mode, where each detector is treated separately, or in stereoscopic mode where they are considered together. Using the monocular mode the HiRes collaboration measured the cosmic ray spectrum and made the first observation of the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin cutoff. In this paper we present the cosmic ray spectrum measured by the stereoscopic technique. Good agreement is found with the monocular spectrum in all details.},

The origin of this feature remains unknown. A small workshop to review some modern experimental measurements of this region was held at the Adler Planetarium in Chicago, USA in June 2000. This paper summarizes the results presented at this workshop and the discussion of their interpretation in the context of hadronic models of atmospheric air showers.},

	Abstract = {This biennial Review summarizes much of particle physics. Using data from previous editions, plus 2778 new measurements from 645 papers, we list, evaluate, and average measured properties of gauge bosons, leptons, quarks, mesons, and baryons. We also summarize searches for hypothetical particles such as Higgs bosons, heavy neutrinos, and supersymmetric particles. All the particle properties and search limits are listed in Summary Tables. We also give numerous tables, figures, formulae, and reviews of topics such as the Standard Model, particle detectors, probability, and statistics. Among the 108 reviews are many that are new or heavily revised including those on CKM quark-mixing matrix, Vud &Vus, Vcb &Vub, top quark, muon anomalous magnetic moment, extra dimensions, particle detectors, cosmic background radiation, dark matter, cosmological parameters, and big bang cosmology. A booklet is available containing the Summary Tables and abbreviated versions of some of the other sections of this full Review. All tables, listings, and reviews (and errata) are also available on the Particle Data Group website: http://pdg.lbl.gov.},

@article{Tavio:2008,
	Abstract = {We present an approximation for the average density profile of dark matter haloes in the LambdaCDM cosmological model, which is accurate to within 10--15% even for large radial distances from 0.05R_{vir} up to 10R_{vir} for halo masses ranging from 10^{11.5} to 10^{15.0} h^{-1}M_{Sun}. We propose a modified form of the Navarro, Frenk & White (NFW) approximation: \rho(r)=\rho_{NFW}(r)+ A (r/R_{vir})^{-1}+B (1+r/R_{vir})^{-1}. This generalized expression, which is applicable to the external regions of dark matter haloes, only very slightly affects the density in the inner regions of haloes. The strong correlation among the different parameters in the model allows us to describe the profile in terms of just one parameter: the virial mass. We integrate our density profile to derive the enclosed mass in a sphere of a given radius and compare it with the NFW results. We find that the NFW underestimates the enclosed mass by more than 50% at 10R_{vir}, whereas our model reproduces the results from numerical simulations to within 2% accuracy even at this distance. We also use this new approximation to study the weak gravitational lensing and to obtain an analytic expression for the tangential shear. This allows us to quantify the contribution to the shear from the outer regions of the density profile. For the first time we calculate the difference between the tangential shear calculated via the NFW profile and the corresponding result when the external regions of haloes in cosmological simulations are taken into account. We find a 4% difference for all the mass ranges under study.},

	Abstract = {We carried out a numerical calculation for the propagation of ultra-high energy cosmic ray nucleons in the inergalactic space by a Monte-Carlo method. The resulting energy spectrum above 1018 eV is modified by the interaction of nucleons with the micro wave background (MWB) photons, forming a bump and a cutoff, with position depending on the propagation distance and source distribution. It is found that the treatment of the evolution of the universe and the interactions between cosmic rays and MWB photons is crucial. We also calculated the spectra of neutrinos and gamma rays produced by the interaction of nucleons with MWB photons. The flux of these particles strongly depends on propagation distance, cosmological evolution parameter and the maximum energy of the cosmic rays. The possibility to detect the secondary neutrinos is also discussed.},

	Abstract = {Data collected by the Pierre Auger Observatory provide evidence for anisotropy in the arrival directions of the cosmic rays with the highest-energies, which are correlated with the positions of relatively nearby active galactic nuclei (AGN) [Pierre Auger Collaboration, Science 318 (2007) 938]. The correlation has maximum significance for cosmic rays with energy greater than ˜6 × 1019 eV and AGN at a distance less than ˜75 Mpc. We have confirmed the anisotropy at a confidence level of more than 99% through a test with parameters specified a priori, using an independent data set. The observed correlation is compatible with the hypothesis that cosmic rays with the highest-energies originate from extra-galactic sources close enough so that their flux is not significantly attenuated by interaction with the cosmic background radiation (the Greisen Zatsepin Kuz'min effect). The angular scale of the correlation observed is a few degrees, which suggests a predominantly light composition unless the magnetic fields are very weak outside the thin disk of our galaxy. Our present data do not identify AGN as the sources of cosmic rays unambiguously, and other candidate sources which are distributed as nearby AGN are not ruled out. We discuss the prospect of unequivocal identification of individual sources of the highest-energy cosmic rays within a few years of continued operation of the Pierre Auger Observatory.},

The measurements are based entirely on flash-analog-to-digital conversion of phototube signals, digitized continuously at 10MHz, and stored in a deep (820mus) pipeline, for deadtimeless readout following a parallel pipeline trigger. The massive parallel processing by digital signal processors and programmable logic devices is distributed site-wide, with 42 telescopes and a central facility linked by optical fiber. The system was designed and built at Columbia University, Nevis Laboratories.},

@article{Swordy:2001,
	Abstract = {The existing paradigm of the origin of Galactic cosmic rays places strong supernovae shocks as the acceleration site for this material. However, although the EGRET gamma-ray telescope has reported evidence for GeV gamma rays from some supernovae, it is still unclear if the signal is produced by locally intense cosmic rays. Although non-thermal X-ray emissions have been detected from supernova remnants and interpreted as synchrotron emission from locally intense electrons at energies up to ~100 TeV, the inferred source energy spectral slopes seem much steeper than the electron source spectrum observed through direct measurements. It remains the case that simple energetics provide the most convincing argument that supernovae power the bulk of cosmic rays. Two characteristics which can be used to investigate this issue at high energy are the source energy spectra and the source composition derived from direct measurements.},

	Abstract = {The presence of photons in the cosmic rays of highest energy (above 1020eV) would be a strong indication of a ``top-down'' production mechanism, e.g. the decay of topological defects. The Pierre Auger Observatory is aimed to detect cosmic rays in this energy range with a large statistics. The pair production in the magnetic field of the Earth, followed by hard synchrotron radiation, generates early cascades containing mainly photons with energies below the LPM threshold (a few 1019 eV) while unconverted photons above this energy produce in the atmosphere slowly developing showers. We describe some observables related to the fluorescence profile and to the ground signals (lateral distribution and front curvature), which can provide a clear signature of abnormally delayed showers, even if they represent a small fraction of the flux. Moreover, the magnetic conversion exhibit a characteristic anisotropy with respect to the local direction of the field, allowing an unambiguous confirmation of photons, against the hypothesis of weakly interacting objects.},

	Abstract = {There has been much interest in possible violations of Lorentz invariance, particularly motivated by quantum gravity theories. It has been suggested that a small amount of Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) could turn off photomeson interactions of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) with photons of the cosmic background radiation and thereby eliminate the resulting sharp steepening in the spectrum of the highest energy CRs predicted by Greisen Zatsepin and Kuzmin (GZK). Recent measurements of the UHECR spectrum reported by the HiRes and Auger collaborations, however, indicate the presence of the GZK effect. We present the results of a detailed calculation of the modification of the UHECR spectrum caused by LIV using the formalism of Coleman and Glashow. We then compare these results with the experimental UHECR data from Auger and HiRes. Based on these data, we find a best-fit amount of LIV of 4.5-4.5+1.5×10, consistent with an upper limit of 6×10. This possible amount of LIV can lead to a recovery of the cosmic ray spectrum at higher energies than presently observed. Such an LIV recovery effect can be tested observationally using future detectors.},

	Abstract = {The discoveries of the GZK cutoff with the HiRes and Auger Observatories and the discovery by Auger of clustering of >~60 EeV ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) towards nearby <~75 Mpc) AGNs along the supergalactic plane establishes the astrophysical origin of the UHECRs. The likely sources of the UHECRs are gamma-ray bursts and radio-loud AGNs because: (1) they are extragalactic; (2) they are sufficiently powerful; (3) acceleration to ultra-high energies can be achieved in their relativistic ejecta; (4) anomalous X-ray and $\gamma$-ray features can be explained by nonthermal hadron acceleration in relativistic blast waves; and (5) sources reside within the GZK radius. Two arguments for acceleration to UHE are presented, and limits on UHECR ion acceleration are set. UHECR ions are shown to be able to survive without photodisintegrating while passing through the AGN scattered radiation field, even if launched deep in the broad line region. UHECR injection throughout cosmic time fits the measured energy spectrum of UHECRs, at least for protons. Local UHECR proton and ion interaction and energy-loss mean free paths are calculated using an empirical fit to the extragalactic background light (EBL) at IR and optical energies. Minimum intergalactic magnetic (IGM) fields ~1e-11 G are derived from clustering assuming specific source origins, e.g., Cen A, nearby AGNs, or GRBs for the super-GZK CRs seen with Auger. Besides distinct cosmic-ray induced gamma-ray signatures that should be observed with the Gamma ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST), source and GZK neutrino detections and the arrival distribution of UHECR in direction and time can finally decide the sources of cosmic rays at the highest energies.},

In spite of the limited acceptance the data which have been gathered have already delivered interesting results on High Energy Cosmic Rays.

HiRes' measurement of the flux of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays shows a sharp suppression at an energy of 6×1019eV, consistent with the expected cutoff energy. We observe the ankle of the cosmic-ray energy spectrum as well, at an energy of 4×1018eV. We describe the experiment, data collection, and analysis and estimate the systematic uncertainties.

	Abstract = {In this paper, we develop an algorithm allowing to calculate line-of-sight velocity dispersions in an axisymmetric galaxy outside the galactic plane. When constructing a self-consistent model, we take into account the galactic surface brightness distribution, stellar rotation curve and velocity dispersions. We assume that the velocity dispersion ellipsoid is triaxial and lies under a certain angle with respect to the galactic plane. This algorithm is applied to an Sa galaxy NGC 4594 = M 104, for which there exist velocity dispersion measurements outside the galactic major-axis. The mass-distribution model is constructed in two stages. In the first stage, we construct a luminosity-distribution model, where only galactic surface brightness distribution is taken into account. Here, we assume the galaxy to consist of the nucleus, the bulge, the disc and the stellar metal-poor halo and determine structural parameters of these components. Thereafter, in the second stage, we develop, based on the Jeans equations, a detailed mass-distribution model and calculate line-of-sight velocity dispersions and the stellar rotation curve. Here, a dark matter (DM) halo is added to visible components. Calculated dispersions are compared with observations along different slit positions perpendicular and parallel to the galactic major-axis. In the best-fitting model, velocity dispersion ellipsoids are radially elongated with sigmatheta/sigmaR ~= 0.9-0.4,sigmaz/sigmaR ~= 0.7-0.4, and lie under the angles less than or equal to 30$\,^{\circ}$ with respect to the galactic equatorial plane. Outside the galactic plane, velocity dispersion behaviour is more sensitive to the DM density distribution and allows to estimate dark halo parameters. For visible matter, the total M/LB = 4.5 +/- 1.2, M/LR = 3.1 +/- 0.7. The central density of the DM halo is rhoDM(0) = 0.033Msolarpc-3.},

	Abstract = {The presence of a massive black hole has been invoked to match the observed rotation velocities and velocity dispersions at the centres of M31, M32, NGC 3115 and NGC 4594, Here we determine stellar line-of-sight velocity profiles of these galaxies, from high spatial resolution, high S/N spectra centred on the G-band, the Mg b triplet and the Ca II IR triplet. For all spectra we determine rotation velocities, V, velocity dispersions, sigma, and deviations of the velocity profiles from a Gaussian shape, as quantified by the Gauss-Hermite moments h_3_,...,h_6_. Significant deviations of the velocity profiles from a Gaussian are present in all objects. The strongest deviations are asymmetries quantified by h_3_ and are found primarily along the major axis. The amplitude of h_3_ is typically |h_3_| <~ 0.15 and is correlated with V/sigma. Its sign always indicates an excess of stars at low rotation velocities, and results in the mean stellar streaming velocity being lower than the mean of the best-fitting Gaussian, the quantity conventionally used to characterize rotation. The difference is ~10 per cent for M31, M32 and NGC 3115, and ~20 per cent for NGC 4594. It is thus important that models take the observed velocity profile shapes into account. We demonstrate that the observed deviations from Gaussian velocity profiles are for the most part not the result of projection and seeing convolution. We calculate the velocity profiles predicted by Tonry's model for M32, taking seeing and projection into account, but assuming the local (unprojected) velocity distributions to be Gaussian. The predicted velocity profiles are nearly Gaussian, in conflict with our data. Self-consistent dynamical models must thus be constructed to fit the observed velocity profiles. Such models should constrain the central structure quite strongly, and will hence provide improved constraints on the mass and presence of a supermassive central object.},

	Abstract = {Simple analytical models, such as the Hernquist model, are very useful tools to investigate the dynamical structure of galaxies. Unfortunately, most of the analytical distribution functions are either isotropic or of the Osipkov-Merritt type, and hence basically one-dimensional. We present three different families of anisotropic distribution functions that self-consistently generate the Hernquist potential-density pair. These families have constant, increasing and decreasing anisotropy profiles respectively, and can hence represent a wide variety of orbital structures. For all of the models presented, the distribution function and the velocity dispersions can be written in terms of elementary functions. These models are ideal tools for a wide range of applications, in particular to generate the initial conditions for N-body or Monte Carlo simulations.},

	Abstract = {The analytical phase-space distribution function (DF) of spherical self-consistent galaxy (or cluster) models, embedded in a dark matter halo, where both density distributions follow the Hernquist profile, with different total masses and core radii (hereafter "HH models"), is presented. The concentration and the amount of the stellar and dark matter distributions are described by four parameters: the mass and core radius of the reference component and two dimensionless parameters that describe the mass and core radius of the halo component A variable amount of orbital anisotropy is allowed in both components, following the widely used Osipkov-Merritt parameterization. An important case is obtained for a null core radius of the halo, corresponding to the presence of a central black hole (BH).  Before giving the explicit form for the DF, the necessary and sufficient conditions that the model parameters must satisfy in order to correspond to a consistent system (i.e., a system for which each physically distinct component has a positive DF) are analytically derived. In this context, it is proved that globally isotropic HH models are consistent for any mass ratio and core radii ratio, even in the case of a central BH. In this last case, the analytical expression for a lower limit of the anisotropy radius of the host system as a function of the BH mass is given. These results are then compared with those obtained by direct inspection of the DF. In the particular case of global isotropy, the stability of HH models is proved, and the explicit formula for the differential energy distribution is derived. Finally, the stability of radially anisotropic HH models is briefly discussed.   The expression derived for the DF is useful for understanding the relations between anisotropy, density shape, and external potential well in a consistent stellar system and to produce initial conditions for N-body simulations of two-component galaxies or galaxy clusters.},

These techniques are well-known amongst experts, but the current literature lacks a formal description.

	Abstract = {Fluctuations in the temperature of the cosmic microwave background have now been detected over a wide range of angular scales, and a consistent picture seems to be emerging. This article describes some of the implications for cosmology. Analysis of all of the published detections suggests the existence of a peak on degree scales with a height 2.4 to 10 (90 percent confidence level) times the amplitude of the power spectrum at large angular scales. This result confirms an early prediction, implies that the universe did in fact recombine, and limits theories of structure formation. Illustrative examples show how comparison of the microwave background data and the large-scale structure data will be a potentially powerful means of answering fundamental questions about the universe.},

	Abstract = {Detailed calculations of the temperature fluctuations in the cosmic background radiation for universes dominated by massive collisionless relics of the big bang are presented. An initially adiabatic constant curvature perturbation spectrum is assumed. In models with cold dark matter, the simplest hypothesis - that galaxies follow the mass distribution leads to small-scale anisotropies which exceed current observational limits if omega is less than 0.2 h to the -4/3. Since low values of omega are indicated by dynamical studies of galaxy clustering, cold particle models in which light traces mass are probably incorrect. Reheating of the pregalactic medium is unlikely to modify this conclusion. In cold particle or neutrino-dominated universes with omega = 1, presented predictions for small-scale and quadrupole anisotropies are below current limits. In all cases, the small-scale fluctuations are predicted to be about 10 percent linearly polarized.},

	Abstract = {We present a simplified treatment for calculating the cosmic microwave background anisotropy power spectrum in adiabatic models. It consists of solving for the evolution of a two-fluid model until the epoch of recombination and then integrating over the sources to obtain the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy power spectrum. The approximation is useful both for a physical understanding of CMB anisotropies as well as for a quantitative analysis of cosmological models. Comparison with exact calculations shows that the accuracy is typically 10%-20% over a large range of angles and cosmological models, including those with curvature and cosmological constant. Using this approximation we investigate the dependence of the CMB anisotropy on the cosmological parameters. We identify six dimensionless parameters that uniquely determine the anisotropy power spectrum within our approximation. CMB experiments on different angular scales could in principle provide information on all these parameters. In particular, mapping of the Doppler peaks would allow an independent determination of baryon mass density, matter mass density, and the Hubble constant.},

	Abstract = {Computations of the radiation correlation functions and angular power spectra are presented for microwave-background anisotropies expected in Omega = 1 cold-dark-matter-dominated universes with scale-invariant adiabatic or isocurvature initial conditions. The results are valid on all angular scales. The statistical properties of the radiation pattern are described, and the theory of two-dimensional Gaussian random fields is developed. A large number of properties of such fields may be derived analytically or semianalytically, such as the number densities of hot and cold spots, the eccentricities of peaks, and peak correlation properties. The formulas presented here provide valuable insight into the textural characteristics of the microwave-background anisotropies and must be satisfied if the primordial fluctuations are Gaussian. The assumption of Gaussian initial conditions makes it possible to make highly specific predictions for the pattern of the temperature anisotropies. This is demonstrated by the construction of maps of the fluctuations predicted for the total intensity and the polarization.},

The formalism is an extension to the polarized case of the analytic approach recently developed by Hu and Sugiyama to evaluate the (unpolarized) temperature correlation function. The analytic approach helps to highlight the dependence of potentially measurable polarization properties of the cosmic microwave background radiation upon various parameters of the cosmological model. We show, for instance, that the ratio between the multipoles of the temperature and polarization correlation functions depends very sensitively upon the value of Omega0, the matter density in units of the critical, in an open universe.},

	Abstract = {We examine the orbits of satellite galaxies identified in a suite of N-body/gasdynamical simulations of the formation of L* galaxies in a Lambda cold dark matter universe. The numerical resolution of the simulations allows us to track in detail the orbits of the ~ 10 brightest satellites around each primary. Most satellites follow conventional orbits; after turning around, they accrete into their host halo and settle on orbits whose apocentric radii are steadily eroded by dynamical friction. As a result, satellites associated with the primary are typically found within its virial radius, rvir, and have velocities consistent with a Gaussian distribution with mild radial anisotropy. However, a number of outliers are also present. We find that a surprising number (about one-third) of satellites identified at z = 0 are on unorthodox orbits, with apocentres that exceed their turnaround radii. These include a number of objects with extreme velocities and apocentric radii at times exceeding ~3.5rvir (or, e.g. >~1 Mpc when scaled to the Milky Way). This population of satellites on extreme orbits consists typically of the faint member of a satellite pair whose kinship is severed by the tidal field of the primary during first approach. Under the right circumstances, the heavier member of the pair remains bound to the primary, whilst the lighter companion is ejected on to a highly energetic orbit. Since the concurrent accretion of multiple satellite systems is a defining feature of hierarchical models of galaxy formation, a fairly robust prediction of this scenario is that at least some of these extreme objects should be present in the Local Group. We speculate that this three-body ejection mechanism may be the origin of (i) some of the newly discovered high-speed satellites around M31 (such as Andromeda XIV); (ii) some of the distant fast-receding Local Group members, such as Leo I and (iii) the oddly isolated dwarf spheroidals Cetus and Tucana in the outskirts of the Local Group. Our results suggest that care must be exercised when using the orbits of the most weakly bound satellites to place constraints on the total mass of the Local Group.},

From this starting point, the reader is introduced to perturbations about an FRW universe: their evolution with the Einstein-Boltzmann equations, their generation by primordial inflation, and their observational consequences. These consequences include the anisotropy spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) featuring acoustic peaks and polarization, the matter power spectrum with baryonic wiggles, and their detection via photometric galaxy surveys, redshift distortions, cluster abundances, and Modern Cosmology is the first book to explain in detail the structure of the acoustic peaks in the CMB, the E/B decomposition in polarization which may allow for detection of primordial gravity waves, and the modern analysis techniques used on increasingly large cosmological data sets. Readers will gain the tools needed to work in cosmology and learn how modern observations are rapidly revolutionizing our picture of the universe.},

	Abstract = {Working toward a model-independent understanding of cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies and their significance, we undertake a comprehensive and self-contained study of scalar perturbation theory. Initial conditions, evolution, thermal history, matter content, background dynamics, and geometry all play a role in determining the anisotropy. By employing analytic techniques to illuminate the numerical results, we are able to separate and identify each contribution. We thus bring out the nature of the total Sachs-Wolfe effect, acoustic oscillations, diffusion damping, Doppler shifts, and reionization, as well as their particular manifestation in a crittical, curvature, or cosmological constant dominated universe. By studying the full angular and spatial content of the resultant fluctuations, we isolate the signature of these effects from the dependence on initial conditions. Whereas structure in the Sachs-Wolfe anisotropy depends strongly on the underlying power spectra, the acoustic oscillations provide features which are nearly model independent. This may allow for future determination of the matter content of the Universe as well as the adiabatic and/or isocurvature nature of the initial fluctuations.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a systematic treatment of the linear theory of scalar gravitational perturbations in the synchronous gauge and the conformal Newtonian (or longitudinal) gauge. It differs from others in the literature in that we give, in both gauges, a complete discussion of all particle species that are relevant to any flat cold dark matter (CDM), hot dark matter (HDM), or CDM + HDM models (including a possible cosmological constant). The particles considered include CDM, baryons, photons, massless neutrinos, and massive neutrinos (an HDM candidate), where the CDM and baryons are treated as fluids while a detailed phase-space description is given to the photons and neutrinos.  Particular care is applied to the massive neutrino component, which has been either ignored or approximated crudely in previous works.  Isentropic initial conditions on superhorizon scales are derived. The coupled, linearized Boltzmann, Einstein, and fluid equations that govern the evolution of the metric and density perturbations are then solved numerically in both gauges for the standard CDM model and two CDM + HDM models with neutrino mass densities Omeganu = 0.2 and 0.3, assuming a scale-invariant, adiabatic spectrum of primordial fluctuations. We also give the full details of the cosmic microwave background anisotropy, and present the first accurate calculations of the angular power spectra in the two CDM + HDM models including photon polarization, higher neutrino multipole moments, and helium recombination. The numerical programs for both gauges are available at http://arcturus.mit.edu/cosmics.},

@article{Saglia:2010,
	Abstract = {We present new optical long-slit data along six position angles of the bulge region of M 31. We derive accurate stellar and gas kinematics reaching 5 arcmin from the center, where the disk light contribution is always less than 30%, and out to 8 arcmin along the major axis, where the disk provides 55% of the total light. We show that the velocity dispersions of McElroy (1983) are severely underestimated (by up to 50 km s-1). As a consequence, previous dynamical models have underestimated the stellar mass of M 31's bulge by a factor of 2. As a further consequence, the light-weighted velocity dispersion of the galaxy grows to 166 km s-1 and to 170 km s-1 if rotation is also taken into account, thus reducing the discrepancy between the predicted and measured mass of the black hole at the center of M 31 from a factor of 3 to a factor of 2. The kinematic position angle varies with distance, pointing to triaxiality, but a quantitative conclusion can be reached only after simultaneous proper dynamical modeling of the bulge and disk components is performed. We detect gas counterrotation near the bulge minor axis. We measure eight emission-corrected Lick indices. They are approximately constant on circles. Using simple stellar population models we derive the age, metallicity and alpha-element overabundance profiles. Except for the region in the inner arcsecs of the galaxy, the bulge of M 31 is uniformly old (>= 12 Gyr, with many best-fit ages at the model grid limit of 15 Gyr), slightly alpha-elements overabundant ([alpha/Fe] ≈ 0.2) and of solar metallicity, in agreement with studies of the resolved stellar components. The predicted u-g, g-r and r-i Sloan color profiles match the dust-corrected observations reasonably well, within the known limitations of current simple stellar population models. The stellar populations have approximately radially constant mass-to-light ratios (M/LR ≈ 4-4.5 M_o/L_o for a Kroupa IMF), which is in agreement with the stellar dynamical estimates based on our new velocity dispersions. In the inner arcsecs the luminosity-weighted age drops to 4-8 Gyr, while the metallicity increases to above three times the solar value. Starting from 6 arcmin from the center along the major axis, the mean age drops to <=8 Gyr with slight supersolar metallicity (≈ +0.1 dex) and alpha-element overabundance (≈ +0.2 dex) for a mass-to-light ratio M/LR <= 3 M_o/L_o. Diagnostic diagrams based on the [OIII]/Hbeta and [NI]/Hbeta emission line equivalent widths (EWs) ratios indicate that the gas is ionized by shocks outside 10 arcsec, but an AGN-like ionizing source could be present near the center. We speculate that a gas-rich minor merger happened some 100 Myr ago, causing the observed minor axis gas counterrotation, the recent star formation event and possibly some nuclear activity.

	Abstract = {This is the fourth paper in a series in which we attempt to put constraints on the flattening of dark halos in disk galaxies. We observed for this purpose the HI in edge-on galaxies, where it is in principle possible to measure the force field in the halo vertically and radially from gas layer flaring and rotation curve decomposition respectively. We have analysed the HI channel maps to accurately measure all four functions that describe the HI kinematics and 3D distribution: the radial HI surface density, the HI vertical thickness, the rotation curve and the HI velocity dispersion. In this paper we analyse these data for the edge-on galaxy UGC7321. We measured the stellar mass distribution ($M=3\times10^8$ \msun with $M/L_R\lesim0.2$), finding that the vertical force of the gas disk dominates the stellar disk at all radii. We find that the vertical force puts a much stronger constraint on the stellar mass-to-light ratio than rotation curve decomposition. Fitting of the vertical force field derived from the flaring and velocity dispersion of the HI revealed that UGC7321 has a spherical halo density distribution with a flattening of $q = c/a = 1.0 \pm 0.1$.},

	Abstract = {New radial velocity measurements for previously known and newly confirmed globular clusters (GCs) in the nearby massive galaxy NGC 5128 are presented. We have obtained spectroscopy from LDSS-2/Magellan, VIMOS/VLT, and Hydra/CTIO from which we have measured the radial velocities of 218 known, and identified 155 new, GCs. The current sample of confirmed GCs in NGC 5128 is now 605 with 564 of these having radial velocity measurements. We have performed a new kinematic analysis of the GC system that extends out to 45 arcmin in galactocentric radius. We have examined the systemic velocity, projected rotation amplitude and axis, and the projected velocity dispersion of the GCs as functions of galactocentric distance and metallicity. Our results indicate that the metal-poor GCs have a very mild rotation signature of (26 pm 15) km/s. The metal-rich GCs are rotating with a higher, though still small signature of (43 pm 15) km/s around the isophotal major axis of NGC 5128 within 15 arcmin. Their velocity dispersions are consistent within the uncertainties and the profiles appear flat or declining within 20 arcmin. We note the small sample of metal-rich GCs with ages less than 5 Gyr in the literature appear to have different kinematic properties than the old, metal-rich GC subpopulation. The mass and mass-to-light ratios have also been estimated using the GCs as tracer particles for NGC 5128. Out to a distance of 20 arcmin, we have obtained a mass of (5.9 pm 2.0) x 10^(11) M_(sun) and a mass-to-light ratio in the B-band of 16 M_(sun)/L_(B,sun). Combined with previous work on the ages and metallicities of its GCs, as well as properties of its stellar halo, our findings suggest NGC 5128 formed via hierarchical merging over other methods of formation, such as major merging at late times.},

	Abstract = {We present an efficient method of computing cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies in nonflat universes. First, we derive the Boltzmann equation for CMB temperature and polarization fluctuations produced by scalar perturbations in a general Robertson-Walker universe. We then apply the integral method in order to solve this equation, writing temperature and polarization anisotropies as a time integral over a geometrical term and a source term. The geometrical terms can be written using ultra-spherical Bessel functions, which depend on curvature. These cannot be precomputed, as for flat space. Instead, we solve their differential equation directly for selected values of the multipoles. The resulting computational time is comparable to the flat-space case, improving over previous methods by 2-3 orders of magnitude. This allows one to compute highly accurate CMB temperature and polarization spectra, matter transfer functions, and their CMB normalizations for any cosmological model, thereby avoiding the need to use the various inexact fitting formulae that exist in the literature.},

@article{Seljak:1996,
	Abstract = {We present a new method for calculating linear cosmic microwave background (CM B) anisotropy spectra based on integration over sources along the photon past light cone. In this approach the temperature anisotropy is written as a time integral over the product of a geometrical term and a source term. The geometrical term is given by radial eigenfunctions, which do not depend on the particular cosmological model. The source term can be expressed in terms of photon, baryon, and metric perturbations, all of which can be calculated using a small number of differential equations. This split clearly separates the dynamical from the geometrical effects on the CMB anisotropies. More importantly, it allows us to significantly reduce the computational time compared to standard methods. This is achieved because the source term, which depends on the model and is generally the most time-consuming part of calculation, is a slowly varying function of wavelength and needs to be evaluated only in a small number of points. The geometrical term, which oscillates much more rapidly than the source term, does not depend on the particular model and can be precomputed in advance. Standard methods that do not separate the two terms require a much higher number of evaluations. The new method leads to about 2 orders of magnitude reduction in CPU time when compared to standard methods and typically requires a few minutes on a workstation for a single model. The method should be especially useful for accurate determinations of cosmological parameters from CMB anisotropy and polarization measurements that will become with the next generation of experiments. A program implementing this method can be obtained from the authors.},

	Abstract = {This paper is the first in a series which studies interactions between M31 and its satellites, including the origin of the giant southern stream. We construct accurate yet simple analytic models for the potential of the M31 galaxy to provide an easy basis for the calculation of orbits in M31's halo. We use a Navarro, Frenk and White (NFW) dark halo, an exponential disc, a Hernquist bulge, and a central black hole point mass to describe the galaxy potential. We constrain the parameters of these functions by comparing to existing surface-brightness, velocity-dispersion, and rotation-curve measurements of M31. Our description provides a good fit to the observations, and agrees well with more sophisticated modelling of M31. While in many respects the parameter set is well constrained, there is substantial uncertainty in the outer halo potential and a near-degeneracy between the disc and halo components, producing a large, nearly two-dimensional allowed region in parameter space. We limit the allowed region using theoretical expectations for the halo concentration, baryonic content, and stellar mass-to-light ratio (M/LR), finding a smaller region where the parameters are physically plausible. Our proposed mass model for M31 has Mbulge= 3.2 × 1010Msolar, Mdisc= 7.2 × 1010Msolar, and M200= 7.1 × 1011Msolar, with uncorrected (for internal and foreground extinction) mass-to-light ratios of M/LR= 3.9 and 3.3 for the bulge and disc, respectively. We present some illustrative test-particle orbits for the progenitor of the stellar stream in our galaxy potential, highlighting the effects of the remaining uncertainty in the disc and halo masses.},

@article{Yin:2009,
	Abstract = {Aims: We study the chemical evolution of the disks of the Milky Way (MW) and of Andromeda (M 31), to identify the common properties and differences between the two major galaxies of the Local Group.  Methods: We use a large set of observational data for M 31, including observations of the star formation rate (SFR) and gas profiles, as well as stellar metallicity distributions along its disk. When expressed in terms of the corresponding disk scale lengths, we show that the observed radial profiles of MW and M 31 exhibit interesting similarities, suggesting the possibility of a description within a common framework. Results: We find that the profiles of stars, gas fraction, and metallicity of the two galaxies, as well as most of their global properties, are well described by our model, provided that the star formation efficiency in M 31 disk is twice as high as in the MW. We show that the star formation rate profile of M 31 cannot be described by any form of the Kennicutt-Schmidt law (KS Law) for star formation. We propose that these discrepancies are caused by the fact that M 31 has an active star formation history in the recent past, consistent with the hypotheses of a ``head-on'' collision with the neighboring galaxy (most probably M 32) about 200 Myr ago.  Conclusions: The MW has most probably experienced quiescent secular evolution, making possible a fairly successful description with a simple model. If M 31 is more typical of spiral galaxies, more complex models, involving galaxy interactions, will be required for the description of spirals.},

We find that the luminosity is in the range 9.6-13.2 x10^7 solar luminosities or M_V ~ -15.1 - 15.5, with 70% of the light residing in the debris streams. The progenitor is somewhat fainter than the present-day Small Magellanic Cloud, and comparable in brightness to the M31 dwarf spheroidals NGC 147 and NGC 185. Using cosmologically motivated models, we estimate that the mass of Sgr's dark matter halo prior to tidal disruption was ~10^10 solar masses.},

	Abstract = {The narrow GD-1 stream of stars, spanning 60 deg on the sky at a distance of ~10 kpc from the Sun and ~15 kpc from the Galactic center, is presumed to be debris from a tidally disrupted star cluster that traces out a test-particle orbit in the Milky Way halo. We combine SDSS photometry, USNO-B astrometry, and SDSS and Calar Alto spectroscopy to construct a complete, empirical 6-dimensional phase-space map of the stream. We find that an eccentric orbit in a flattened isothermal potential describes this phase-space map well. Even after marginalizing over the stream orbital parameters and the distance from the Sun to the Galactic center, the orbital fit to GD-1 places strong constraints on the circular velocity at the Sun's radius V_c=224 \pm 13 km/s and total potential flattening q_\Phi=0.87^{+0.07}_{-0.04}. When we drop any informative priors on V_c the GD-1 constraint becomes V_c=221 \pm 18 km/s. Our 6-D map of GD-1 therefore yields the best current constraint on V_c and the only strong constraint on q_\Phi at Galactocentric radii near R~15 kpc. Much, if not all, of the total potential flattening may be attributed to the mass in the stellar disk, so the GD-1 constraints on the flattening of the halo itself are weak: q_{\Phi,halo}>0.89 at 90% confidence. The greatest uncertainty in the 6-D map and the orbital analysis stems from the photometric distances, which will be obviated by Gaia.},

	Abstract = {It is generally assumed that the central galaxy in a dark matter halo, that is, the galaxy with the lowest specific potential energy, is also the brightest halo galaxy (BHG), and that it resides at rest at the centre of the dark matter potential well. This central galaxy paradigm (CGP) is an essential assumption made in various fields of astronomical research. In this paper we test the validity of the CGP using a large galaxy group catalogue constructed from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. For each group we compute two statistics, ${\cal R}$ and ${\cal S}$, which quantify the offsets of the line-of-sight velocities and projected positions of brightest group galaxies relative to the other group members. By comparing the cumulative distributions of $|{\cal R}|$ and $|{\cal S}|$ to those obtained from detailed mock group catalogues, we rule out the null-hypothesis that the CGP is correct. Rather, the data indicate that in a non-zero fraction $f_{\rm BNC}(M)$ of all haloes of mass $M$ the BHG is not the central galaxy, but instead, a satellite galaxy. In particular, we find that $f_{\rm BNC}$ increases from $\sim 0.25$ in low mass haloes ($10^{12} h^{-1} {\rm M_{\odot}} \leq M \lsim 2 \times 10^{13} h^{-1}{\rm M_{\odot}}$) to $\sim 0.4$ in massive haloes ($M \gsim 5 \times 10^{13} h^{-1} {\rm M_{\odot}}$). We show that these values of $f_{\rm BNC}$ are uncomfortably high compared to predictions from halo occupation statistics and from semi-analytical models of galaxy formation. We end by discussing various implications of a non-zero $f_{\rm BNC}(M)$, with an emphasis on the halo masses inferred from satellite kinematics.},

	Abstract = {The Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) 5-year data provide stringent limits on deviations from the minimal, six-parameter Lambda cold dark matter model. We report these limits and use them to constrain the physics of cosmic inflation via Gaussianity, adiabaticity, the power spectrum of primordial fluctuations, gravitational waves, and spatial curvature. We also constrain models of dark energy via its equation of state, parity-violating interaction, and neutrino properties, such as mass and the number of species. We detect no convincing deviations from the minimal model. The six parameters and the corresponding 68% uncertainties, derived from the WMAP data combined with the distance measurements from the Type Ia supernovae (SN) and the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) in the distribution of galaxies, are: Omega b  h 2 = 0.02267+0.00058 -0.00059, Omega c  h 2 = 0.1131 $\pm$ 0.0034, OmegaLambda = 0.726 $\pm$ 0.015, ns = 0.960 $\pm$ 0.013, tau = 0.084 $\pm$ 0.016, and \Delta _{\cal R}^2 = (2.445\pm 0.096)\times 10^{-9} at k = 0.002 Mpc-1. From these, we derive sigma8 = 0.812 $\pm$ 0.026, H 0 = 70.5 $\pm$ 1.3 km s-1 Mpc-1, Omega b  = 0.0456 $\pm$ 0.0015, Omega c  = 0.228 $\pm$ 0.013, Omega m  h 2 = 0.1358+0.0037 -0.0036, z reion = 10.9 $\pm$ 1.4, and t 0 = 13.72 $\pm$ 0.12 Gyr. With the WMAP data combined with BAO and SN, we find the limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of r < 0.22(95%CL), and that ns > 1 is disfavored even when gravitational waves are included, which constrains the models of inflation that can produce significant gravitational waves, such as chaotic or power-law inflation models, or a blue spectrum, such as hybrid inflation models. We obtain tight, simultaneous limits on the (constant) equation of state of dark energy and the spatial curvature of the universe: -0.14 < 1 + w < 0.12(95%CL) and -0.0179 < Omega k  < 0.0081(95%CL). We provide a set of "WMAP distance priors," to test a variety of dark energy models with spatial curvature. We test a time-dependent w with a present value constrained as -0.33 < 1 + w 0 < 0.21 (95% CL). Temperature and dark matter fluctuations are found to obey the adiabatic relation to within 8.9% and 2.1% for the axion-type and curvaton-type dark matter, respectively. The power spectra of TB and EB correlations constrain a parity-violating interaction, which rotates the polarization angle and converts E to B. The polarization angle could not be rotated more than -5fdg9 < Deltaalpha < 2fdg4 (95% CL) between the decoupling and the present epoch. We find the limit on the total mass of massive neutrinos of ∑m nu < 0.67 eV(95%CL), which is free from the uncertainty in the normalization of the large-scale structure data. The number of relativistic degrees of freedom (dof), expressed in units of the effective number of neutrino species, is constrained as N eff = 4.4 $\pm$ 1.5 (68%), consistent with the standard value of 3.04. Finally, quantitative limits on physically-motivated primordial non-Gaussianity parameters are -9 < f local NL < 111 (95% CL) and -151 < f equil NL < 253 (95% CL) for the local and equilateral models, respectively.  WMAP is the result of a partnership between Princeton University and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. Scientific guidance is provided by the WMAP Science Team.},

	Abstract = {Observations of the lengthy tidal streams produced by the destruction of the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal (Sgr dSph) are capable of providing strong constraints on the shape of the Galactic gravitational potential. However, previous work, based on modeling different stream properties in axisymmetric Galactic models, has yielded conflicting results: while the angular precession of the Sgr leading arm is most consistent with a spherical or slightly oblate halo, the radial velocities of stars in this arm are reproduced only by prolate halo models. We demonstrate that this apparent paradox can be resolved by instead adopting a triaxial potential. Our new Galactic halo model, which simultaneously fits all well-established phase space constraints from the Sgr stream, provides the first conclusive evidence for, and tentative measurement of, triaxiality in an individual dark matter halo. The Milky Way halo within ~60 kpc is best characterized by a minor/major axis ratio of the isovelocity contours c/a ≈ 0.67, intermediate/major axis ratio b/a ≈ 0.83, and triaxiality parameter T ~ 0.56. In this model, the minor axis of the dark halo is coincident with the Galactic X-axis connecting the Sun and the Galactic center to within ~15$\,^{\circ}$, while the major axis also lies in the Galactic plane, approximately along the Galactic Y-axis.},

	Abstract = {We demonstrate that the output of a cosmological N-body simulation can, to remarkable accuracy, be scaled to represent the growth of large-scale structure in a cosmology with parameters similar to but different from those originally assumed. Our algorithm involves three steps: a reassignment of length, mass and velocity units, a relabelling of the time axis, and a rescaling of the amplitudes of individual large-scale fluctuation modes. We test it using two matched pairs of simulations. Within each pair, one simulation assumes parameters consistent with analyses of the first-year WMAP data. The other has lower matter and baryon densities and a 15% lower fluctuation amplitude, consistent with analyses of the three-year WMAP data. The pairs differ by a factor of a thousand in mass resolution, enabling performance tests on both linear and nonlinear scales. Our scaling reproduces the mass power spectra of the target cosmology to better than 0.5% on large scales (k < 0.1 h/Mpc) both in real and in redshift space. In particular, the BAO features of the original cosmology are removed and are correctly replaced by those of the target cosmology. Errors are still below 3% for k < 1 h/Mpc. Power spectra of the dark halo distribution are even more precisely reproduced, with errors below 1% on all scales tested. A halo-by-halo comparison shows that centre-of-mass positions and velocities are reproduced to better than 90 kpc/h and 5%, respectively. Halo masses, concentrations and spins are also reproduced at about the 10% level, although with small biases. Halo assembly histories are accurately reproduced, leading to central galaxy magnitudes with errors of about 0.25 magnitudes and a bias of about 0.13 magnitudes for a representative semi-analytic model.},

	Abstract = {We calculate orbits for the Milky Way dwarf galaxies with proper motions, and compare these to subhalo orbits in a high resolution cosmological simulation. We use the simulation data to assess how well orbits may be recovered in the face of measurement errors, a time varying triaxial gravitational potential, and satellite-satellite interactions. For present measurement uncertainties, we recover the apocentre r_a and pericentre r_p to ~40%. With improved data from the Gaia satellite we should be able to recover r_a and r_p to ~14%, respectively. However, recovering the 3D positions and orbital phase of satellites over several orbits is more challenging. This owes primarily to the non-sphericity of the potential and satellite interactions during group infall. Dynamical friction, satellite mass loss and the mass evolution of the main halo play a more minor role in the uncertainties. We apply our technique to nine Milky Way dwarfs with observed proper motions. We show that their mean apocentre is lower than the mean of the most massive subhalos in our cosmological simulation, but consistent with the most massive subhalos that form before z=10. This lends further support to the idea that the Milky Way's dwarfs formed before reionisation.},

@article{Pasquali:2009,
	Abstract = {Using a large SDSS galaxy group catalogue, we study how the stellar ages and metallicities of central and satellite galaxies depend on stellar mass and halo mass. We find that satellites are older and metal-richer than centrals of the same stellar mass. In addition, the slopes of the age-stellar mass and metallicity-stellar mass relations are found to become shallower in denser environments. This is due to the fact that the average age and metallicity of low mass satellite galaxies increase with the mass of the halo in which they reside. A comparison with the semi-analytical model of Wang et al. (2008) shows that it succesfully reproduces the fact that satellites are older than centrals of the same stellar mass and that the age difference increases with the halo mass of the satellite. This is a consequence of strangulation, which leaves the stellar populations of satellites to evolve passively, while the prolonged star formation activity of centrals keeps their average ages younger. The resulting age offset is larger in more massive environments because their satellites were accreted earlier. The model fails, however, in reproducing the halo mass dependence of the metallicities of low mass satellites, yields metallicity-stellar mass and age-stellar mass relations that are too shallow, and predicts that satellite galaxies have the same metallicities as centrals of the same stellar mass, in disagreement with the data. We argue that these discrepancies are likely to indicate the need to (i) modify the recipes of both supernova feedback and AGN feedback, (ii) use a more realistic description of strangulation, and (iii) include a proper treatment of the tidal stripping, heating and destruction of satellite galaxies.

	Abstract = {We propose that the rotational kinematics of the globular cluster system (GCS) in M31 can result from a past major merger event that could have formed its bulge component. We numerically investigate kinematical properties of globular clusters (GCs) in remnants of galaxy mergers between two discs with GCs in both their disc and halo components. We find that the GCS formed during major merging can show strongly rotational kinematics with the maximum rotational velocities of ~140-170 km s-1 for a certain range of orbital parameters of merging. We also find that a rotating stellar bar, which can be morphologically identified as a boxy bulge if seen edge-on, can be formed in models for which the GCSs show strongly rotational kinematics. We thus suggest that the observed rotational kinematics of GCs with different metallicities in M31 can be closely associated with the ancient major merger event. We discuss whether the formation of the rotating bulge/bar in M31 can be due to the ancient merger.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the properties of satellite galaxies formed in N-body/SPH simulations of galaxy formation in the LambdaCDM cosmology. The simulations include the main physical effects thought to be important in galaxy formation and, in several cases, produce realistic spiral discs. In total, a sample of nine galaxies of luminosity comparable to the Milky Way was obtained. At magnitudes brighter than the resolution limit, MV = -12, the luminosity function of the satellite galaxies in the simulations is in excellent agreement with data for the Local Group. The radial number density profile of the model satellites, as well as their gas fractions also match observations very well. In agreement with previous N-body studies, we find that the satellites tend to be distributed in highly flattened configurations whose major axis is aligned with the major axis of the (generally triaxial) dark halo. In two out of three systems with sufficiently large satellite populations, the satellite system is nearly perpendicular to the plane of the galactic disc, a configuration analogous to that observed in the Milk Way. The discs themselves are perpendicular to the minor axis of their host haloes in the inner parts, and the correlation between the orientation of the galaxy and the shape of the halo persists even out to the virial radius. However, in one case the disc's minor axis ends up, at the virial radius, perpendicular to the minor axis of the halo. The angular momenta of the galaxies and their host halo tend to be well aligned.},

	Abstract = {The 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) is designed to measure redshifts for approximately 250000 galaxies. This paper describes the survey design, the spectroscopic observations, the redshift measurements and the survey data base. The 2dFGRS uses the 2dF multifibre spectrograph on the Anglo-Australian Telescope, which is capable of observing 400 objects simultaneously over a 2$\,^{\circ}$ diameter field. The source catalogue for the survey is a revised and extended version of the APM galaxy catalogue, and the targets are galaxies with extinction-corrected magnitudes brighter than bJ=19.45. The main survey regions are two declination strips, one in the southern Galactic hemisphere spanning 80$\,^{\circ}$×15$\,^{\circ}$ around the SGP, and the other in the northern Galactic hemisphere spanning 75$\,^{\circ}$×10$\,^{\circ}$ along the celestial equator; in addition, there are 99 fields spread over the southern Galactic cap. The survey covers 2000deg2 and has a median depth of z=0.11. Adaptive tiling is used to give a highly uniform sampling rate of 93 per cent over the whole survey region. Redshifts are measured from spectra covering 3600-8000{\AA} at a two-pixel resolution of 9.0{\AA} and a median S/N of 13pixel-1. All redshift identifications are visually checked and assigned a quality parameter Q in the range 1-5 Q>=3 redshifts are 98.4 per cent reliable and have an rms uncertainty of 85kms-1. The overall redshift completeness for Q>=3 redshifts is 91.8 per cent, but this varies with magnitude from 99 per cent for the brightest galaxies to 90 per cent for objects at the survey limit. The 2dFGRS data base is available on the World Wide Web at <extlink type="url">http://www.mso.anu.edu.au/2dFGRS.</extlink>},

	Abstract = {We use the conditional luminosity function Phi(L|M) dL, which gives the number of galaxies with luminosities in the range L+/- d L/2 that reside in a halo of mass M, to link the distribution of galaxies to that of dark matter haloes. Starting from the number density of dark matter haloes predicted by current models of structure formation, we seek the form of Phi(L|M) that reproduces the galaxy luminosity function and the luminosity dependence of the galaxy clustering strength. We test the models of Phi(L|M) by comparing the resulting mass-to-light ratios with constraints from the Tully-Fisher (TF) relation and from galaxy clusters. A comparison between model predictions and current observations yields a number of stringent constraints on both galaxy formation and cosmology. In particular, this method can break the degeneracy between Omega0 and the power-spectrum normalization sigma8, inherent in current weak-lensing and cluster-abundance studies. For flat LambdaCDM cosmogonies with sigma8 normalized by recent weak gravitational lensing observations, the best results are obtained for Omega0~ 0.3; Omega0<~ 0.2 leads to too large galaxy correlation lengths, while Omega0>~ 0.4 gives too high mass-to-light ratios to match the observed TF relation. The best-fitting model for the LambdaCDM concordance cosmology with Omega0= 0.3 and OmegaLambda= 0.7 predicts mass-to-light ratios that are slightly too high to match the TF relation. We discuss a number of possible effects that might remedy this problem, such as small modifications of sigma8 and the Hubble parameter with respect to the concordance values, the assumption that the Universe is dominated by warm dark matter, systematic errors in current observational data, and the existence of dark galaxies. We use the conditional luminosity function derived from the present data to predict several statistics about the distribution of galaxy light in the local Universe. We show that roughly 50 per cent of all light is produced in haloes less massive than 2 × 1012h-1 Msolar. We also derive the probability distribution P(M|L) dM that a galaxy of luminosity L resides in a halo with virial masses in the range M+/- dM/2.},

	Abstract = {We present the Mock Map Facility, a powerful tool for converting theoretical outputs of hierarchical galaxy formation models into catalogues of virtual observations. The general principle is straightforward: mock observing cones can be generated using semi-analytically post-processed snapshots of cosmological N-body simulations. These cones can then be projected to synthesize mock sky images. To this end, the paper describes in detail an efficient technique for creating such mock cones and images from the galaxies in cosmological simulations (GALICS) semi-analytic model, providing the reader with an accurate quantification of the artefacts it introduces at every step. We show that replication effects introduce a negative bias on the clustering signal - typically peaking at less than 10 per cent around the correlation length. We also thoroughly discuss how the clustering signal is affected by finite-volume effects, and show that it vanishes at scales larger than approximately one-tenth of the simulation box size. For the purpose of analysing our method, we show that number counts and redshift distributions obtained with GALICS/MOMAF compare well with K-band observations and the two-degree field galaxy redshift survey. Given finite-volume effects, we also show that the model can reproduce the automatic plate measuring machine angular correlation function. The MOMAF results discussed here are made publicly available to the astronomical community through a public data base. Moreover, a user-friendly Web interface (http://galics.iap.fr) allows any user to recover her/his own favourite galaxy samples through simple SQL queries. The flexibility of this tool should permit a variety of uses ranging from extensive comparisons between real observations and those predicted by hierarchical models of galaxy formation, to the preparation of observing strategies for deep surveys and tests of data processing pipelines.},

	Abstract = {We present a new model for computing the spectral evolution of stellar populations at ages between 1 × 105 and 2 × 1010 yr at a resolution of 3 {\AA} across the whole wavelength range from 3200 to 9500 {\AA} for a wide range of metallicities. These predictions are based on a newly available library of observed stellar spectra. We also compute the spectral evolution across a larger wavelength range, from 91 {\AA} to 160 mum, at lower resolution. The model incorporates recent progress in stellar evolution theory and an observationally motivated prescription for thermally pulsing stars on the asymptotic giant branch. The latter is supported by observations of surface brightness fluctuations in nearby stellar populations. We show that this model reproduces well the observed optical and near-infrared colour-magnitude diagrams of Galactic star clusters of various ages and metallicities. Stochastic fluctuations in the numbers of stars in different evolutionary phases can account for the full range of observed integrated colours of star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds. The model reproduces in detail typical galaxy spectra from the Early Data Release (EDR) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We exemplify how this type of spectral fit can constrain physical parameters such as the star formation history, metallicity and dust content of galaxies. Our model is the first to enable accurate studies of absorption-line strengths in galaxies containing stars over the full range of ages. Using the highest-quality spectra of the SDSS EDR, we show that this model can reproduce simultaneously the observed strengths of those Lick indices that do not depend strongly on element abundance ratios. The interpretation of such indices with our model should be particularly useful for constraining the star formation histories and metallicities of galaxies.},

	Abstract = {Analytic methods for studying the formation of galaxies by gas condensation within massive dark halos are presented. The present scheme applies to cosmogonies where structure grows through hierarchical clustering of a mixture of gas and dissipationless dark matter. The simplest models consistent with the current understanding of N-body work on dissipationless clustering, and that of numerical and analytic work on gas evolution and cooling are adopted. Standard models for the evolution of the stellar population are also employed, and new models for the way star formation heats and enriches the surrounding gas are constructed. Detailed results are presented for a cold dark matter universe with Omega = 1 and H(0) = 50 km/s/Mpc, but the present methods are applicable to other models. The present luminosity functions contain significantly more faint galaxies than are observed.},

@article{De-Lucia:2007,
	Abstract = {We use semi-analytic techniques to study the formation and evolution of brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs). We show the extreme hierarchical nature of these objects and discuss the limitations of simple ways to capture their evolution. In a model where cooling flows are suppressed at late times by active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity, the stars of BCGs are formed very early (50 per cent at z ~ 5, 80 per cent at z ~ 3) and in many small galaxies. The high star formation rates in these high-z progenitors are fuelled by rapid cooling, not by merger-triggered starbursts. We find that model BCGs assemble surprisingly late: half their final mass is typically locked up in a single galaxy after z ~ 0.5. Because most of the galaxies accreted on to BCGs have little gas content and red colours, late mergers do not change the apparent age of BCGs. It is this accumulation of a large number of old stellar populations - driven mainly by the merging history of the dark matter halo itself - that yields the observed homogeneity of BCG properties. In the second part of the paper, we discuss the evolution of BCGs to high redshifts, from both observational and theoretical viewpoints. We show that our model BCGs are in qualitative agreement with high-z observations. We discuss the hierarchical link between high-z BCGs and their local counterparts. We show that high-z BCGs belong to the same population as the massive end of local BCG progenitors, although they are not in general the same galaxies. Similarly, high-z BCGs end up as massive galaxies in the local Universe, although only a fraction of them are actually BCGs of massive clusters.},

	Abstract = {The cold dark matter model has become the leading theoretical picture for the formation of structure in the Universe. This model, together with the theory of cosmic inflation, makes a clear prediction for the initial conditions for structure formation and predicts that structures grow hierarchically through gravitational instability. Testing this model requires that the precise measurements delivered by galaxy surveys can be compared to robust and equally precise theoretical calculations. Here we present a simulation of the growth of dark matter structure using 2,1603 particles, following them from redshift z = 127 to the present in a cube-shaped region 2.230 billion lightyears on a side. In postprocessing, we also follow the formation and evolution of the galaxies and quasars. We show that baryon-induced features in the initial conditions of the Universe are reflected in distorted form in the low-redshift galaxy distribution, an effect that can be used to constrain the nature of dark energy with future generations of observational surveys of galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We analyse the dynamical properties of substructures in a high-resolution dark matter simulation of the formation of a Milky Way-like halo in a Lambdacold dark matter cosmology. Our goal is to shed light on the dynamical peculiarities of the Milky Way satellites. Our simulations show that about one-third of the subhaloes have been accreted in groups. We quantify this clustering by measuring the alignment of the angular momentum of subhaloes in a group. We find that this signal is visible even for objects accreted up to z ~ 1, i.e. 8 Gyr ago, and long after the spatial coherence of the groups has been lost due the host tidal field. This group infall may well explain the ghostly streams proposed by Lynden-Bell & Lynden-Bell to orbit the Milky Way. Our analyses also show that if most satellites originate in a few groups, the disc-like distribution of the Milky Way satellites would be almost inevitable. This non-random assignment of satellites to subhaloes implies an environmental dependence on whether these low-mass objects are able to form stars, possibly related to the nature of reionization in the early Universe. With this picture, both the `ghostly streams' and the `disc-like configuration' are manifestations of the same phenomenon: the hierarchical growth of structure down to the smallest scales.},

	Abstract = {Nearby clusters such as Virgo and Coma possess galaxy distributions that tend to be aligned with the principal axis of the cluster itself. This has also been confirmed by a recent statistical analysis of some 300 Abell clusters, where the effect has been linked to the dynamical state of the cluster. Moreover, the orbits of satellite galaxies in galactic systems like our own Milky Way also demonstrate a high degree of anisotropy-the so-called Holmberg effect, the origin of which has been the subject of debate for more than 30 years. This study presents the analysis of cosmological simulations focusing on the orbits of satellite galaxies within dark matter halos. The apocenters of the orbits of these satellites are preferentially found within a cone of opening angle ~40$\,^{\circ}$ around the major axis of the host halo, in accordance with the observed anisotropy found in galaxy clusters. We do, however, note that a link to the dynamical age of the cluster is not well established, as both of our oldest dark matter halos do show a clear anisotropy signal. Further analysis connects this distribution to the infall pattern of satellites along the filaments: the orbits are determined rather by the environment of the host halo than some ``dynamical selection'' during their life within the host's virial radius.},

	Abstract = {In two recent papers, we developed a powerful technique to link the distribution of galaxies to that of dark matter haloes by considering halo occupation numbers as a function of galaxy luminosity and type. In this paper we use these distribution functions to populate dark matter haloes in high-resolution N-body simulations of the standard LambdaCDM cosmology with Omegam= 0.3, OmegaLambda= 0.7 and sigma8= 0.9. Stacking simulation boxes of 100 h-1 Mpc and 300 h-1 Mpc with 5123 particles each we construct mock galaxy redshift surveys out to a redshift of z= 0.2 with a numerical resolution that guarantees completeness down to 0.01L*. We use these mock surveys to investigate various clustering statistics. The predicted two-dimensional correlation function xi(rp, pi) reveals clear signatures of redshift space distortions. The projected correlation functions for galaxies with different luminosities and types, derived from xi(rp, pi), match the observations well on scales larger than ~3 h-1 Mpc. On smaller scales, however, the model overpredicts the clustering power by about a factor two. Modelling the `finger-of-God' effect on small scales reveals that the standard LambdaCDM model predicts pairwise velocity dispersions (PVD) that are ~400 km s-1 too high at projected pair separations of ~1 h-1 Mpc. A strong velocity bias in massive haloes, with bvel≡sigmagal/sigmadm~ 0.6 (where sigmagal and sigmadm are the velocity dispersions of galaxies and dark matter particles, respectively) can reduce the predicted PVD to the observed level, but does not help to resolve the overprediction of clustering power on small scales. Consistent results can be obtained within the standard LambdaCDM model only when the average mass-to-light ratio of clusters is of the order of 1000 (M/L)solar in the B-band. Alternatively, as we show by a simple approximation, a LambdaCDM model with sigma8~= 0.75 may also reproduce the observational results. We discuss our results in light of the recent WMAP results and the constraints on sigma8 obtained independently from other observations.},

	Abstract = {We use high-resolution N-body simulations to study the equilibrium density profiles of dark matter halos in hierarchically clustering universes. We find that all such profiles have the same shape, independent of the halo mass, the initial density fluctuation spectrum, and the values of the cosmological parameters. Spherically averaged equilibrium profiles are well fitted over two decades in radius by a simple formula originally proposed to describe the structure of galaxy clusters in a cold dark matter universe. In any particular cosmology, the two scale parameters of the fit, the halo mass and its characteristic density, are strongly correlated. Low-mass halos are significantly denser than more massive systems, a correlation that reflects the higher collapse redshift of small halos. The characteristic density of an equilibrium halo is proportional to the density of the universe at the time it was assembled. A suitable definition of this assembly time allows the same proportionality constant to be used for all the cosmologies that we have tested. We compare our results with previous work on halo density profiles and show that there is good agreement. We also provide a step-by-step analytic procedure, based on the Press-Schechter formalism, that allows accurate equilibrium profiles to be calculated as a function of mass in any hierarchical model.},

@article{Yang:2005,
	Abstract = {We use the halo occupation model to calibrate galaxy group finders in magnitude limited redshift surveys. Because, according to the current scenario of structure formation, galaxy groups are associated with cold dark matter (CDM) haloes, we make use of the properties of the halo population in the design of our group finder. The method starts with an assumed mass-to-light ratio to assign a tentative mass to each group. This mass is used to estimate the size and velocity dispersion of the underlying halo that hosts the group, which in turn is used to determine group membership (in redshift space). This procedure is repeated until no further changes occur in group memberships. We find that the final groups selected this way are insensitive to the mass-to-light ratio assumed. We use mock catalogues, constructed using the conditional luminosity function (CLF), to test the performance of our group finder in terms of completeness of true members and contamination by interlopers. Our group finder is more successful than the conventional friends-of-friends (FOF) group finder in assigning galaxies in common dark matter haloes to a single group. We apply our group finder to the 2-degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) and compare the resulting group properties with model predictions based on the CLF. For the LambdaCDM concordance cosmology, we find a clear discrepancy between the model and data in the sense that the model predicts too many rich groups. In order to match the observational results, we have to either increase the mass-to-light ratios of rich clusters to a level significantly higher than current observational estimates, or to assume sigma8~= 0.7, compared with the concordance value of 0.9.},

	Abstract = {Using a large galaxy group catalog based on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 4, we measure three different types of intrinsic galaxy alignment within groups: halo alignment between the orientation of the brightest group galaxies (BGG) and the distribution of its satellite galaxies, radial alignment between the orientation of a satellite galaxy and the direction toward its BGG, and direct alignment between the orientation of the BGG and that of its satellites. In agreement with previous studies, we find that satellite galaxies are preferentially located along the major axis. In addition, on scales r<0.7Rvir we find that red satellites are preferentially aligned radially with the direction to the BGG. The orientations of blue satellites, however, are perfectly consistent with being isotropic. Finally, on scales r<0.1Rvir, we find a weak but significant indication for direct alignment between satellites and BGGs. We briefly discuss the implications for weak-lensing measurements.},

	Abstract = {We use the fourth data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to investigate the orientations of 4289 satellite galaxies with respect to their hosts. The orientation of the satellites is inconsistent with a random distribution at the 99.94% confidence level, and the satellites show a preference for elongation in the direction of their hosts. Further, on scales <50 kpc the major axes of the host galaxies and their satellites are preferentially aligned. Phrased in the terminology of weak lensing, the images of the satellites have a mean shear of gammaT=-0.045+/-0.010, averaged over scales 10 kpc<=rP<=50 kpc. In a galaxy-galaxy lensing study in which lenses and sources are separated solely on the basis of apparent magnitude, we estimate that on scales <~250 kpc satellite galaxies account for between 10% and 15% of the objects that are identified as sources. In such studies, elongation of the satellites will cause a reduction of the galaxy-galaxy lensing shear by of order 25%-40%. Hence, the elongation of satellite galaxies in the direction of their hosts is a potentially important effect for precision studies of galaxy-galaxy lensing and argues strongly in favor of the use of accurate photometric redshifts in order to identify lenses and sources in future studies.},

A marginally significant tendency is found for galaxies to be aligned along the plane of the Local Supercluster. This preferential alignment effect is found to exist mainly for galaxies at high supergalactic latitude and for galaxies which are seen nearly edge-on. The results are interpreted as supporting the view that superclusters formed prior to the formation of the constituent galaxies and clusters.},

The observed distribution of this angle is inconsistent with the tidal hypothesis, and is consistent with a complete lack of correlation between the spins. When a stronger criterion for isolation is adopted, the results are still inconsistent with the tidal hypothesis, with reduced significance level.},

	Abstract = {We generalize the well-known mixtures of Gaussians approach to density estimation and the accompanying Expectation-Maximization technique for finding the maximum likelihood parameters of the mixture to the case where each data point carries an individual d-dimensional uncertainty covariance and has unique missing data properties. This algorithm reconstructs the error-deconvolved or "underlying" distribution function common to all samples, even when the individual data points are samples from different distributions, obtained by convolving the underlying distribution with the unique uncertainty distribution of the data point and projecting out the missing data directions. We show how this basic algorithm can be extended with Bayesian priors on all of the model parameters and a "split-and-merge" procedure designed to avoid local maxima of the likelihood. We apply this technique to a few typical astrophysical applications.},

This decision is often made arbitrarily or subjectively, but it need not be. A jackknife or leave-one-out cross-validation likelihood is defined and employed as a scalar objective function for optimization of the locations and widths of the bins. The objective is justified as being related to the histogram's usefulness for predicting future data. The method works for data or histograms of any dimensionality.},

	Abstract = {If the Solar System is long-lived and non-resonant (that is, if the planets are bound and have evolved independently through many orbital times), and if the system is observed at any non-special time, it is possible to infer the dynamical properties of the Solar System (such as the gravitational force or acceleration law) from a snapshot of the planet positions and velocities at a single moment in time. We consider purely radial acceleration laws of the form a_r= -A [r/r_0]^{-\alpha}, where r is the distance from the Sun. Using only an instantaneous kinematic snapshot (valid at 2009 April 1.0) for the eight major planets and a Bayesian probabilistic inference technique, we infer 1.989<\alpha<2.052 (95-percent confidence). Our results confirm those of Newton (1687) and contemporaries, who inferred \alpha=2 (with no stated uncertainty) via the comparison of computed and observationally inferred orbit shapes (closed ellipses with the Sun at one focus; Kepler 1609). Generalizations of the methods used here will permit, among other things, inference of Milky-Way dynamics from Gaia-like observations.},

	Abstract = {We present the results of a kinematic survey of the dwarf spheroidal satellite of M31, And IX, which appears to be the lowest surface brightness and also the faintest galaxy (MV=-8.3) found to date. Using Keck DEIMOS spectroscopic data, we have measured its velocity relative to M31, its velocity dispersion, and its metallicity. It exhibits a significant velocity dispersion sigmav=6.8+3.0-2.0 km s-1, which coupled with the low luminosity implies a very high mass-to-V-band light ratio, M/L~93+120-50 Msolar/Lsolar (M/L>17 Msolar/Lsolar at 99% confidence). Unless strong tidal forces have perturbed this system, this smallest of galaxies is a highly dark matter-dominated system.},

@article{McConnachie:2006,
	Abstract = {The spatial distribution of the Galactic satellite system plays an important role in Galactic dynamics and cosmology, where its successful reproduction is a key test of simulations of galaxy halo formation. Here, we examine its representative nature by conducting an analysis of the three-dimensional spatial distribution of the M31 subgroup of galaxies, the next closest system to our own. We begin by a discussion of distance estimates and incompleteness concerns, before revisiting the question of membership of the M31 subgroup. We constrain this by consideration of the spatial and kinematic properties of the putative satellites. Comparison of the distribution of M31 and Galactic satellites relative to the galactic discs suggests that the Galactic system is probably modestly incomplete at low latitudes by ~=20 per cent. We find that the radial distribution of satellites around M31 is more extended than the Galactic subgroup; 50 per cent of the Galactic satellites are found within ~100 kpc of the Galaxy, compared to ~200 kpc for M31. We search for `ghostly streams' of satellites around M31, in the same way others have done for the Galaxy, and find several, including some that contain many of the dwarf spheroidal satellites. The lack of M31-centric kinematic data, however, means that we are unable to probe whether these streams represent real physical associations. Finally, we find that the M31 satellites are asymmetrically distributed with respect to our line of sight to this object, so that the majority of its satellites are on its near side with respect to our line of sight. We quantify this result in terms of the offset between M31 and the centre of its satellite distribution, and find it to be significant at the ~ 3σ level. We discuss possible explanations for this finding, and suggest that many of the M31 satellites may have been accreted only relatively recently. Alternatively, this anisotropy may be related to a similar result recently reported for the 2dFGRS, which would imply that the halo of M31 is not yet virialized. Until such time as a satisfactory explanation for this finding is presented, however, our results warn against treating the M31 subgroup as complete, unbiased and relaxed. },

	Abstract = {We investigate the locations of the satellites of relatively isolated host galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Millennium Run simulation. Provided we use two distinct prescriptions to embed luminous galaxies within the simulated dark matter halos (ellipticals share the shapes of their halos, while disks have angular momenta that are aligned with the net angular momenta of their halos), we find a fair agreement between observation and theory. Averaged over scales r_p \le 500 kpc, the satellites of red, high-mass hosts with low star formation rates are found preferentially near the major axes of their hosts. In contrast, the satellites of blue, low-mass hosts with low star formation rates show little to no anisotropy when averaged over the same scale. The difference between the locations of the satellites of red and blue hosts cannot be explained by the effects of interlopers in the data. Instead, it is caused primarily by marked differences in the dependence of the mean satellite location, <\phi>, on the projected distance at which the satellites are found. We also find that the locations of red, high-mass satellites with low star formation rates show considerably more anisotropy than do the locations of blue, low--mass satellites with high star formation rates. There are two contributors to this result. First, the blue satellites have only recently arrived within their hosts' halos, while the red satellites arrived in the far distant past. Second, the sample of blue satellites is heavily contaminated by interlopers, which suppresses the measured anisotropy compared to the intrinsic anisotropy. },

	Abstract = {We explore the angular distribution of two samples of satellite galaxies orbiting isolated hosts extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 4. We find a clear alignment of the satellites along the major axis of their hosts when restricting the analysis to red-coloured hosts. The anisotropy is most pronounced for red satellites of red hosts. We find that the distribution of the satellites about blue, isolated hosts is consistent with isotropy. We show that under the assumption that the true, underlying distribution of satellites of blue hosts exhibits the same anisotropy as the satellites of red hosts, the sample of blue hosts is too small to measure this anisotropy at a statistically significant level. The anisotropy that we detect for satellites about red hosts is independent of the projected radius. In particular, it is evident at large projected distances from the hosts (300 < rp < 500 kpc). },

	Abstract = {The highly flattened distribution of satellite galaxies in the Milky Way (MW) presents a number of puzzles. First, its polar alignment stands out from the planar alignments commonly found in other galaxies. Secondly, recent proper-motion measurements reveal that the orbital angular momentum of at least three, and possibly as many as eight, of the MW's satellites points (within 30$\,^{\circ}$) along the axis of their flattened configuration, suggesting some form of coherent motion. In this paper, we use a high-resolution cosmological simulation to investigate whether this pattern conflicts with the expectations of the cold dark matter model of structure formation. We find that this seemingly unlikely setup occurs often: approximately 35 per cent of the time, we find systems in which the angular momentum of three individual satellites points along, or close to, the short axis of the satellite distribution. In addition, in 30 per cent of the systems we find that the net angular momentum of the six best-aligned satellites lies within 35$\,^{\circ}$ of the short axis of the satellite distribution, as observed for the MW. },

	Abstract = {We analyze the angular distribution and the orbital rotation directions of a sample of carefully selected satellite galaxies about disk galaxy primaries extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We complement this analysis with a theoretical study of these statistics in an N-body simulation of cosmological structure formation set within the ΛCDM paradigm under various assumptions for the orientations of disk angular momenta. Under the assumption that the angular momenta of the disks are aligned with the angular momenta of the inner regions of their host dark matter halos, we find that the fraction of simulated satellite halos that exhibit prograde motion is fprog~0.55-0.60, with larger satellites more likely to be prograde. In our observational sample, approximately 60% of the satellites exhibit prograde motion, a result that is broadly consistent with the simulated sample. Our observational sample of satellite galaxies shows no evidence for an anisotropic satellite distribution relative to disk primaries; however, the small sample size does not yet support a statistically significant comparison to previous studies of satellite anisotropy. Again, this result is broadly consistent with our simulated sample of satellites under the assumption that disk and halo angular momenta are aligned. However, the small size of our observational sample does not yet allow us to distinguish between various assumptions regarding the orientations of disks in their halos. Finally, we present an assessment of the importance of contamination by interlopers on the measured prograde and retrograde statistics. },

	Abstract = {We compute the locations of satellite galaxies with respect to their hosts using the ΛCDM GIF simulation. If the major axes of the hosts' images are perfectly aligned with the major axes of the projected mass, the satellites are located preferentially close to the hosts' major axes. In this case, the degree of anisotropy in the satellite locations is a good tracer of the flattening of the hosts' halos. If all hosts have luminous circular disks, the symmetry axes of the projected mass and light are not perfectly aligned, and the locations of the satellites depend on how the hosts' disks are placed within their halos. If the disk angular momentum vectors are aligned with the major axes of the halos, the satellites show a pronounced Holmberg effect. If the disk angular momentum vectors are aligned with the intermediate axes of the local large-scale structure, the distribution of the satellite locations is essentially isotropic. If the disk angular momentum vectors are aligned with either the minor axes or with the net angular momentum vectors of the halos, the satellites are distributed anisotropically about their hosts, with a preference for being found near the hosts' major axes. This agrees well with the observation that satellite galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey tend to be found near the major axes of their hosts and suggests that the mass and light of SDSS host galaxies must be fairly well aligned in projection on the sky. },

	Abstract = {We compute the two-point image correlation function for bright galaxies in the seventh data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) over angular scales 0.01' <= \theta <= 120' and projected separations 0.01 Mpc <= r <= 10 Mpc. We restrict our analysis to SDSS galaxies with accurate spectroscopic redshifts, and we find strong evidence for intrinsic alignment of the galaxy images. On scales greater than r ~ 40 kpc, the intrinsic alignment of the SDSS galaxy images compares well with the intrinsic alignment of galaxy images in a Lambda-CDM universe, provided we impose Gaussian-random errors on the position angles of the theoretical galaxies with a dispersion of 25 degrees. Without the inclusion of these errors, the amplitude of the two-point image correlation function for the theoretical galaxies is a factor of ~2 higher than it is for the SDSS galaxies. We interpret this as a combination of modest position angle errors for the SDSS galaxies, as well as a need for modest misalignment of mass and light in the theoretical galaxies. The intrinsic alignment of the SDSS galaxies shows no dependence on the specific star formation rates of the galaxies and, at most, a very weak dependence on the colors and stellar masses of the galaxies. At the ~3-sigma level, however, we find an indication that the images of the most luminous SDSS galaxies are more strongly aligned with each other than are the images of the least luminous SDSS galaxies. },

	Abstract = {Masers found in massive star-forming regions can be located precisely in six-dimensional phase space and therefore serve as a tool for studying Milky Way dynamics. The non-random orbital phases at which the masers are found and the sparseness of current samples require modeling. Here, we model the phase-space distribution function of 18 precisely measured Galactic masers, permitting a mean velocity offset and a general velocity dispersion tensor relative to their local standards of rest, and accounting for different pieces of prior information. With priors only on the Sun's distance from the Galactic Center and on its motion with respect to the local standard of rest, the maser data provide a weak constraint on the circular velocity at the Sun of Vc = 246 $\pm$ 30 km s-1. Including prior information on the proper motion of Sgr A* leads to Vc = 244 $\pm$ 13 km s-1. We do not confirm the value of Vc ≈ 254 km s-1 found in more restrictive models. This analysis shows that there is no conflict between recent determinations of Vc from Galactic Center analyses, orbital fitting of the GD-1 stellar stream, and the kinematics of Galactic masers; a combined estimate is Vc = 236 $\pm$ 11 km s-1. Apart from the dynamical parameters, we find that masers tend to occur at post-apocenter, circular-velocity-lagging phases of their orbits. },

	Abstract = {In the past several years high resolution kinematic data sets from Milky Way satellite galaxies have confirmed earlier indications that these systems are dark matter dominated objects. Further understanding of what these galaxies reveal about cosmology and the small scale structure of dark matter relies in large part on a more detailed interpretation of their internal kinematics. This article discusses a likelihood formalism that extracts important quantities from the kinematic data, including the amplitude of rotation, proper motion, and the mass distribution. In the simplest model the projected error on the rotational amplitude is shown to be $\sim 0.5 $ km s$^{-1}$ with $\sim 10^3$ stars from either classical or ultra-faint satellites. The galaxy Sculptor is analyzed for the presence of a rotational signal; no significant detection of rotation is found, and given this result limits are derived on the Sculptor proper motion. A criteria for model selection is discussed that determines the parameters required to describe the dark matter halo density profiles and the stellar velocity anisotropy. Applied to four data sets with a wide range of velocities, the likelihood is found to be more sensitive to variations in the slope of the dark matter density profile than variations in the velocity anisotropy. Models with variable radial velocity anisotropy are shown to be preferred relative to those in which this quantity is constant at all radii in the galaxy. },

	Abstract = {An imaging survey of 341 nearby early-type galaxies in the near-infrared K-band atmospheric window (2.2 μm) is described. The galaxies primarily reside in 13 nearby rich clusters (85%), while some additional galaxies are drawn from loose groups (12%) and the general field (3%). Surface photometry was measured for the entire sample. Detailed corrections were derived from an extensive grid of seeing-convolved r^1/4 models and then applied to the isophotal surface brightness, aperture magnitude, and ellipticity profiles. Global photometric parameters were derived from this seeing-corrected photometry. More than 25% of the sample has been observed at least twice, and these repeat measurements demonstrate the small internal uncertainties on the derived global photometric parameters. Extensive comparisons with aperture photometry from the literature demonstrate that the photometric system is fully consistent with other photometric systems to <=0.01 mag and confirm the estimates of internal random uncertainties. Additional global parameters are drawn from the literature in a homogeneous manner in order to construct a large catalog of galaxy properties: 95% of the galaxies have a velocity dispersion, 69% have a Mg_2 index, 80% have an optical r_eff and μ_eff, 82% have a D_n, and 81% have a derived optical-infrared color measurement. This large data set provides excellent source material for investigations of the physical origins of the global scaling relations of early-type galaxies, velocity fields in the local universe, and comparisons to higher redshift early-type galaxies. },

	Abstract = {Optical multislit spectra of globular clusters in two giant elliptical galaxies in the Virgo Cluster indicate average metal abundances of one-sixth and one-tenth solar composition for M49 and M87, respectively. These estimates are based on the strength of Mg lines. Taken together with observations of globular clusters in dwarf ellipticals this suggests a direct relation between mean metallicity of the cluster system and the luminosity of the parent galaxy which is an interesting constraint on theories of cluster formation during the protogalactic epoch. Rotation is evident in both globular cluster systems. The line-of-sight velocity dispersions of clusters in the two galaxies are estimated to be 340 + or - 50 km/s (M49) and 386 + or - 42 km/s (M87). Although sparsely sampled, the velocity dispersion profiles of the cluster systems are flat, suggesting the existence of an isothermal halo of dark matter in these ellipticals. },

@article{Faber:1976,
	Abstract = {Velocity dispersions for 25 E and S0 galaxies are presented which were measured by employing conventional and Fourier techniques to reduce spectral data obtained in scans of the nuclear regions with an image-dissector scanner. The estimates are based primarily on certain sensitive blends near the Mg b triplet and also on the width of the Na D line. Nuclear values of the mass-to-light ratio (M/L(B)) are calculated using measured values of core radii and central surface brightnesses for several of the sampled galaxies, and it is found that the mean value of M/L(B) for giant ellipticals with an absolute bolometric magnitude of less than -20 is 7(H/50) in solar units. This value agrees well with the values for early-type spirals, implies that there is no large discontinuity in M/L between early-type spirals and ellipticals, and constitutes evidence against a stellar population strongly enriched in M-dwarfs. Both velocity dispersion and M/L(B) are found to be correlated with absolute magnitude for normal ellipticals, and the observed increase in M/L(B) is shown to be consistent with an increase in metal abundance with luminosity. It is concluded that ellipticals are close to being a one-parameter family with total mass as the most important independent variable. },

	Abstract = {Near-infrared imaging data on 251 early-type galaxies in clusters and groups are used to construct the near-infrared fundamental plane (FP) r_eff ~ sigma^1.53+/-0.08_0<Sigma_K>^-0.79+/-0.03_eff. The slope of the FP therefore departs from the virial expectation of r_eff ~ sigma^2_0<Sigma>^-1_eff at all optical and near-infrared wavelengths, which could be a result of the variation of M/L along the elliptical galaxy sequence or a systematic breakdown of homology among the family of elliptical galaxies. The slope of the near-infrared FP excludes metallicity variations as the sole cause of the slope of the FP. Age effects, dynamical deviations from a homology, or any combination of these (with or without metallicity), however, are not excluded. The scatter of both the near-infrared and optical FP are nearly identical and substantially larger than the observational uncertainties, demonstrating small but significant intrinsic cosmological scatter for the FP at all wavelengths. The lack of a correlation of the residuals of the near-infrared FP and the residuals from the Mg_2-sigma_0 relation indicates that the thickness of these relations cannot be ascribed only to age or metallicity effects. Because of this metallicity independence, the small scatter of the near-infrared FP excludes a model in which age and metallicity effects ``conspire'' to keep the optical FP thin. All of these results suggest that the possible physical origins of the FP relations are complicated due to combined effects of variations of stellar populations and structural parameters among elliptical galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We present new full-sky temperature and polarization maps in five frequency bands from 23 to 94 GHz, based on data from the first five years of the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) sky survey. The new maps are consistent with previous maps and are more sensitive. The five-year maps incorporate several improvements in data processing made possible by the additional years of data and by a more complete analysis of the instrument calibration and in-flight beam response. We present several new tests for systematic errors in the polarization data and conclude that W-band polarization data is not yet suitable for cosmological studies, but we suggest directions for further study. We do find that Ka-band data is suitable for use; in conjunction with the additional years of data, the addition of Ka band to the previously used Q- and V-band channels significantly reduces the uncertainty in the optical depth parameter, τ. Further scientific results from the five-year data analysis are presented in six companion papers and are summarized in Section 7 of this paper. With the five-year WMAP data, we detect no convincing deviations from the minimal six-parameter ΛCDM model: a flat universe dominated by a cosmological constant, with adiabatic and nearly scale-invariant Gaussian fluctuations. Using WMAP data combined with measurements of Type Ia supernovae and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations in the galaxy distribution, we find (68% CL uncertainties): Ω b  h 2 = 0.02267+0.00058 -0.00059, Ω c  h 2 = 0.1131 $\pm$ 0.0034, ΩΛ = 0.726 $\pm$ 0.015, ns = 0.960 $\pm$ 0.013, τ = 0.084 $\pm$ 0.016, and \Delta _{\cal R}^2 = (2.445\pm 0.096)\times 10^{-9} at k = 0.002 Mpc-1. From these we derive σ8 = 0.812 $\pm$ 0.026, H 0 = 70.5 $\pm$ 1.3 km s-1 Mpc-1, Ω b  = 0.0456 $\pm$ 0.0015, Ω c  = 0.228 $\pm$ 0.013, Ω m  h 2 = 0.1358+0.0037 -0.0036, z reion = 10.9 $\pm$ 1.4, and t 0 = 13.72 $\pm$ 0.12 Gyr. The new limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio is r < 0.22(95%CL), while the evidence for a running spectral index is insignificant, dns /dln k = -0.028 $\pm$ 0.020 (68% CL). We obtain tight, simultaneous limits on the (constant) dark energy equation of state and the spatial curvature of the universe: -0.14 < 1 + w < 0.12(95%CL) and -0.0179 < Ω k  < 0.0081(95%CL). The number of relativistic degrees of freedom, expressed in units of the effective number of neutrino species, is found to be N eff = 4.4 $\pm$ 1.5 (68% CL), consistent with the standard value of 3.04. Models with N eff = 0 are disfavored at >99.5% confidence. Finally, new limits on physically motivated primordial non-Gaussianity parameters are -9 < f local NL < 111 (95% CL) and -151 < f equil NL < 253 (95% CL) for the local and equilateral models, respectively.

	Abstract = {We have analysed the shape of the Fundamental Plane (FP) for a sample of 226 E and S0 galaxies in 10 clusters of galaxies. We find that the distribution of galaxies is well approximated by a plane of the form log r_e=1.24 log sigma-0.82 log <I>_e+gammafor photometry obtained in Gunn r. This result is in good agreement with previous determinations. The FP has a scatter of 0.084 in log r_e. For galaxies with velocity dispersion larger than 100 km s^-1 the scatter is 0.073. If the FP is used for distance determinations this scatter is equivalent to 17 per cent uncertainties on distances to single galaxies. We find that the slope of the FP is not significantly different from cluster to cluster. Selection effects and measurement errors can introduce biases in the derived slope. The residuals of the FP correlate weakly with the velocity dispersion and the surface brightness. Some of the coefficients used in the literature give rather strong correlations between the residuals and absolute magnitudes. This implies that galaxies need to be selected in a homogeneous way to avoid biases of derived distances on the level of 5-10 per cent or smaller. The FP has significant intrinsic scatter. No other structural parameters like ellipticity or isophotal shape can reduce the scatter significantly. This is in contradiction to simple models, which predict that the presence of discs in E and S0 galaxies can introduce scatter in the FP. It remains unknown what the source of scatter is. It is therefore unknown whether this source produces systematic errors in distance determinations. The Mg_2-sigma relation for the cluster galaxies differs slightly from cluster to cluster. Galaxies in clusters with lower velocity dispersions have systematically lower Mg_2. The effect can be caused by both age and metallicity variations. With the current stellar population models, the best agreement with our results regarding the FP is if the offsets are mainly caused by differences in metallicity. Most of the distances that we derive from the FP imply small peculiar motions (<1000 km s^-1). The zero point of the FP must therefore be quite stable. Only for one cluster, located 28 deg from the direction towards the `Great Attractor', do we find a peculiar motion of 1300 km s^-1. This motion is reduced to 890 km s^-1 if we use the FP corrected for the offset of the Mg_2-sigma relation. This confirms earlier suggestions that the residuals from the Mg_2-sigma relation can be used to flag galaxies with deviant populations, and possibly to correct the distance determinations for the deviations.},

	Abstract = {Modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) is an empirically motivated modification of Newtonian gravity or inertia suggested by Milgrom as an alternative to cosmic dark matter. The basic idea is that at accelerations below ao ~ 10-8 cm/s2 ~ cHo/6 the effective gravitational attraction approaches √(gnao), where gn is the usual Newtonian acceleration. This simple algorithm yields flat rotation curves for spiral galaxies and a mass-rotation velocity relation of the form M ∝ V4 that forms the basis for the observed luminosity-rotation velocity relation-the Tully-Fisher law. We review the phenomenological success of MOND on scales ranging from dwarf spheroidal galaxies to superclusters and demonstrate that the evidence for dark matter can be equally well interpreted as evidence for MOND. We discuss the possible physical basis for an acceleration-based modification of Newtonian dynamics as well as the extention of MOND to cosmology and structure formation. },

@article{Pirzkal:2005,
	Abstract = {We identified 46 unresolved source candidates in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF) down to i775=29.5. Unresolved objects were identified using a parameter S, which measures the deviation from the curve of growth of a point source. Extensive testing of this parameter was carried out, including the effects of decreasing signal-to-noise ratio and of the apparent motions of stars, which demonstrated that stars brighter than i775=27.0 could be robustly identified. Low-resolution grism spectra of the 28 objects brighter than i775=27.0 identify 18 M and later stellar type dwarfs, two candidate L dwarfs, two QSOs, and four white dwarfs. Using the observed population of dwarfs with spectral type M4 or later, we derive a Galactic disk scale height of 400+/-100 pc for M and L stars. The local white dwarf density is computed to be as high as (1.1+/-0.3)×10-2 stars pc-3. On the basis of observations taken 73 days apart, we determined that no object in the field has a proper motion larger than 0.027" yr-1 (3 σ detection limit). No high-velocity white dwarfs were identified in the HUDF, and all four candidates appear more likely to be part of the Galactic thick disk. The lack of detected halo white dwarfs implies that if the dark matter halo is 12 Gyr old, white dwarfs account for less than 10% of the dark matter halo mass. },

	Abstract = {Since the Hipparcos mission and recent large scale surveys in the optical and the near-infrared, new constraints have been obtained on the structure and evolution history of the Milky Way. The population synthesis approach is a useful tool to interpret such data sets and to test scenarios of evolution of the Galaxy. We present here new constraints on evolution parameters obtained from the Besan{\c c}on model of population synthesis and analysis of optical and near-infrared star counts. The Galactic potential is computed self-consistently, in agreement with Hipparcos results and the observed rotation curve. Constraints are posed on the outer bulge structure, the warped and flared disc, the thick disc and the spheroid populations. The model is tuned to produce reliable predictions in the visible and the near-infrared in wide photometric bands from U to K. Finally, we describe applications such as photometric and astrometric simulations and a new classification tool based on a Bayesian probability estimator, which could be used in the framework of Virtual Observatories. As examples, samples of simulated star counts at different wavelengths and directions are also given.},

	Abstract = {We present a new homogeneous set of metallicity estimates based on Lick indices for 245 old globular clusters of the M31 galaxy comprised in the Revised Bologna Catalog. The metallicity distribution of the M31 globular clusters is briefly discussed and compared with that of the Milky Way. Simple parametric statistics suggests that the [Fe/H] distribution is likely not unimodal. The strong correlation between metallicity and kinematics found in previous studies is confirmed. The most metal-rich GCs tend to be packed at the center of the system and share the galactic rotation as traced by the HI disk. Although the velocity dispersion around the curve increases with decreasing metallicity, also clusters with [Fe/H]<-1.0 display a clear rotational pattern, at odds with their Milky Way counterparts. },

	Abstract = {Results are reported from an analysis of the structural properties of dynamically hot galaxies which combines central velocity dispersion, effective surface brightness, and effective radius into a new 3-space (k), in which the axes are parameters that are physically meaningful. Hot galaxies are found to divide into groups in k-space that closely parallel conventional morphological classifications, namely, luminous ellipticals, compacts, bulges, bright dwarfs, and dwarf spheroidals. A major sequence is defined by luminous ellipticals, bulges, and most compacts, which together constitute a smooth continuum in k-space. Several properties vary smoothly with mass along this continuum, including bulge-to-disk ratio, radio properties, rotation, degree of velocity anisotropy, and 'unrelaxed'. A second major sequence is comprised of dwarf ellipticals and dwarf spheroidals. It is suggested that mass loss is a major factor in hot dwarf galaxies, but the dwarf sequence cannot be simply a mass-loss sequence, as it has the wrong direction in k-space. },

	Abstract = {I investigate the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation for a sample of galaxies with extended 21 cm rotation curves spanning the range 20 km s-1<~Vf<=300 km s-1. A variety of scalings of the stellar mass-to-light ratio Υ* are considered. For each prescription for Υ*, I give fits of the form Md=AVxf. Presumably, the prescription that comes closest to the correct value will minimize the scatter in the relation. The fit with minimum scatter has A=50 Msolar km-4 s4 and x=4. This relation holds over five decades in mass. Galaxy color, stellar fraction, and Υ* are correlated with each other and with Md, in the sense that more massive galaxies tend to be more evolved. There is a systematic dependence of the degree of maximality of disks on surface brightness. High surface brightness galaxies typically have Υ*~3/4 of the maximum disk value, while low surface brightness galaxies typically attain ~1/4 of this amount. },

	Abstract = {Abstract: We use galaxy groups selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to examine the alignment between the orientation of the central galaxy (defined as the brightest group member) and the distribution of satellite galaxies. By construction, we therefore only address the alignment on scales smaller than the halo virial radius. We find a highly significant alignment of satellites with the major axis of their central galaxy. This is in qualitative agreement with the recent study of Brainerd (2005), but inconsistent with several previous studies who detected a preferential minor axis alignment. The alignment strength in our sample is strongest between red central galaxies and red satellites. On the contrary, the satellite distribution in systems with a blue central galaxy is consistent with isotropic. We also find that the alignment strength is stronger in more massive haloes and at smaller projected radii from the central galaxy. In addition, there is a weak indication that fainter (relative to the central galaxy) satellites are more strongly aligned. We present a detailed comparison with previous studies, and discuss the implications of our findings for galaxy formation. },

	Abstract = {The distribution of satellite galaxies relative to isolated host galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) is investigated. Host-satellite systems are selected using three different methods, yielding samples of ~3300, ~1600, and ~950 satellites. In the plane of the sky, the distributions of all three samples show highly significant deviations from circular symmetry (>99.99%, >99.99%, and 99.79% confidence levels, respectively), and the degree of anisotropy is a strong function of the projected radius, rp, at which the satellites are found. For rp<~100 kpc, the SDSS satellites are aligned preferentially with the major axes of the hosts. This is in stark contrast to the Holmberg effect, in which satellites are aligned with the minor axes of host galaxies. The degree of anisotropy in the distribution of the SDSS satellites decreases with rp and is consistent with an isotropic distribution at of order the 1 σ level for 250 kpc<~rp<~500 kpc. },

@article{Hawley:1975,
	Abstract = {Results of a search for anisotropy in the orientations of observed projected images of galaxies are reported. The data are taken from transparent copies of sky-survey plates. Three regions covered by a total of 15 plates are studied. To reduce and identify systematic errors, a 'double blind' scheme is used in which the plates as observed are rotated by an angle unknown to the scanner, and each plate is measured twice at two different viewing angles. The list of galaxies found in one catalog, but not the other, for a plate gives a measure of systematic error in selecting galaxies, while the list of galaxies found in both catalogs gives a measure of random and systematic errors in measurement. A total of 5559 galaxies have been measured in both catalogs. A small but significant departure from isotropy is found, but there is no reason to believe the effect is real because it does not satisfy tests of reproducibility. No evidence of anisotropy is found in the relative orientations of pairs of galaxies separated by less than about 1 Mpc (H = 100 km/sec per Mpc). For the galaxies in the Coma cluster proper, no evidence for anisotropy relative to a fixed direction in space is found. There is a possible indication that the galaxies are preferentially aligned along the radius vector to the center of the cluster. },

	Abstract = {We investigate the evolution of a population of 100 dark matter satellites orbiting in the gravitational potential of a realistic model of M31. We find that after 10 Gyr, seven subhalos are completely disrupted by the tidal field of the host galaxy. The remaining satellites suffer heavy mass loss and, overall, 75% of the mass initially in the subhalo system is tidally stripped. Not surprisingly, satellites with pericentric radius less than 30 kpc suffer the greatest stripping and leave a complex structure of tails and streams of debris around the host galaxy. Assuming that the most bound particles in each subhalo are kinematic tracers of stars, we find that the halo stellar population resulting from the tidal debris follows an r-3.5 density profile at large radii. We construct B-band photometric maps of stars coming from disrupted satellites and find conspicuous features similar in both morphology and brightness to the observed giant stream around Andromeda. While an assumed star formation efficiency of 5% in the simulated satellite galaxies results in good agreement with the observed V-band surface brightness of M31's stellar halo, an efficiency of 1%-2% accounts for the brightness of the giant stream. During the first 5 Gyr, the bombardment of the satellites heats and thickens the disk by a small amount. At about 5 Gyr, satellite interactions induce the formation of a strong bar, which, in turn, leads to a significant increase in the velocity dispersion of the disk. },

	Abstract = {Abstract: We use a semianalytic galaxy catalogue constructed from the Millennium Simulation to study the satellites of isolated galaxies in the LCDM cosmogony. This sample (~80,000$ bright primaries, surrounded by ~178,000 satellites) allows the characterization, with minimal statistical uncertainty, of the dynamical properties of satellite/primary galaxy systems in a LCDM universe. We find that, overall, the satellite population traces the dark matter rather well: its spatial distribution and kinematics may be approximated by an NFW profile with a mildly anisotropic velocity distribution. Their spatial distribution is also mildly anisotropic, with a well-defined ``anti-Holmberg'' effect that reflects the misalignment between the major axis and angular momentum of the host halo. The isolation criteria for our primaries picks not only galaxies in sparse environments, but also a number of primaries at the centre of ''fossil'' groups. We find that the abundance and luminosity function of these unusual systems are in reasonable agreement with the few available observational constraints. We recover the expected L_{host} \sigma_{sat}^3 relation for LCDM models for truly-isolated primaries. Less strict primary selection, however, leads to substantial modification of the scaling relation. Our analysis also highlights a number of difficulties afflicting studies that rely on blind stacking of satellite systems to constrain the mean halo mass of the primary galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We report the discovery of a new dwarf spheroidal galaxy near M31 on the basis of INT/WFC imaging. The system, Andromeda XVII (And XVII), is located at a projected radius of ~44 kpc from M31, has a line-of-sight distance of 794+/-40 kpc measured using the tip of the red giant branch, and therefore lies well within the halo of M31. The color of the red giant branch implies a metallicity of [Fe/H]~-1.9, and we find an absolute magnitude of MV~-8.5. Three globular clusters lie near the main body of And XVII, suggesting a possible association; if any of these are confirmed, it would make And XVII exceptionally unusual among the faint dSph population. The projected position on the sky of And XVII strengthens an intriguing alignment apparent in the satellite system of M31, although with a caveat about biases stemming from the current area surveyed to significant depth. },

@article{Bailin:2008,
	Abstract = {We identify satellites of isolated galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and examine their angular distribution. Using mock catalogues generated from cosmological N-body simulations, we demonstrate that the selection criteria used to select isolated galaxies and their satellites in large galaxy redshift surveys must be very strict in order to correctly identify systems in which the primary galaxy dominates its environment. We demonstrate that the criteria used in many previous studies instead select predominantly group members. We refine a set of selection criteria for which the group contamination is estimated to be less than 7per cent and present a catalogue of the resulting sample.

The angular distribution of satellites about their host is biased towards the major axes for spheroidal galaxies and probably also for red disc galaxies (the `intermediate' class of Bailin & Harris), but is isotropic for blue disc galaxies, i.e. it is the colour of the host that determines the distribution of its satellites rather than its morphology. The similar anisotropy measured in this study to studies that were dominated by groups implies that group-specific processes are not responsible for the angular distribution. Satellites that are most likely to have been recently accreted, late-type galaxies at large projected radii, show a tendency to lie along the same axis as the surrounding large-scale structure. The orientations of isolated early- and intermediate-type galaxies also align with the surrounding large-scale structures.

We discuss the origin of the anisotropic satellite distribution and consider the implications of our results, critically assessing the respective roles played by the orientation of the visible galaxy within its dark matter halo, anisotropic accretion of satellites from the larger scale environment, and the biased nature of satellites as tracers of the underlying dark matter subhalo population.

	Abstract = {A specialized data-mining algorithm has been developed using wide-field photometry catalogs, enabling systematic and efficient searches for resolved, extremely low surface brightness satellite galaxies in the halo of the Milky Way (MW). Tested and calibrated with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 6 (SDSS-DR6) we recover all 15 MW satellites recently detected in SDSS, six known MW/Local Group dSphs in the SDSS footprint, and 19 previously known globular and open clusters. In addition, 30 point-source overdensities have been found that correspond to no cataloged objects. The detection efficiencies of the algorithm have been carefully quantified by simulating more than three million model satellites embedded in star fields typical of those observed in SDSS, covering a wide range of parameters including galaxy distance, scale length, luminosity, and Galactic latitude. We present several parameterizations of these detection limits to facilitate comparison between the observed MW satellite population and predictions. We find that all known satellites would be detected with >90% efficiency over all latitudes spanned by DR6 and that the MW satellite census within DR6 is complete to a magnitude limit of MV ≈ --6.5 and a distance of 300 kpc. Assuming all existing MW satellites contain an appreciable old stellar population and have sizes and luminosities comparable with currently known companions, we predict lower and upper limit totals of 52 and 340 MW dwarf satellites within ~260 kpc if they are uniformly distributed across the sky. This result implies that many MW satellites still remain undetected. Identifying and studying these elusive satellites in future survey data will be fundamental to test the dark matter distribution on kpc scales. },

	Abstract = {We identify, categorize, and quantify alignment effects among host and satellite galaxies using a spectroscopically-confirmed, low-redshift (z<0.23) galaxy sample from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 6. Consistent with other recent findings, we find that satellite galaxies (SGs) of red, centrally concentrated (elliptical) host galaxies (HGs) with radial velocity separation |Delta_V|<600 km/s preferentially reside near the projected major axes of their HGs. Among these, this preference is strongest for highly concentrated, red SGs. We find that fractional anisotropy increases with decreasing \Delta_V and Delta_R and is nearly 40% greater among the closest SGs (Delta_R<250 kpc/h) relative to more distant (Delta_R>500 kpc/h) SGs. For highly concentrated SGs at small (<300 kpc/h) projected separation, we observe a strong radial (hostward) alignment signal in isophotal position angles (PAs) due to isophotal twisting and contamination that is not present when using galaxy model PAs. Among objects for which both isophotal and galaxy model PAs agree to <15 degrees, this elongation signal is significantly weaker. We also investigate the "Holmberg Effect," a well-known result wherein nearby (<40 kpc/h) SGs of large, inclined spiral HGs were seen to preferentially reside near the minor axes of their HGs. Survey limitations preclude a strict test of this effect using only SDSS spectroscopic galaxies. By adopting a looser set of cuts than those of Holmberg's study, we recover a comparable preference among faint blue SGs for the HG minor axis at marginal significance (~3 sigma). We conclude that several types of alignment likely exist among different galaxy populations, but that the observed nature and strength of alignment trends depend sensitively on both selection criteria and on the method used to determine galaxy orientation. },

	Abstract = {The spatial distributions of the most recently discovered ultra-faint dwarf satellites around the Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxy are compared to the previously reported discs-of-satellites (DoS) of their host galaxies. In our investigation, we pay special attention to the selection bias introduced due to the limited sky coverage of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We find that the new Milky Way satellite galaxies follow closely the DoS defined by the more luminous dwarfs, thereby further emphasizing the statistical significance of this feature in the Galactic halo. We also note a deficit of satellite galaxies with Galactocentric distances larger than 100kpc that are away from the DoS of the Milky Way. In the case of Andromeda, we obtain similar results, naturally complementing our previous finding and strengthening the notion that the DoS are optical manifestations of a phase-space correlation of satellite galaxies. },

	Abstract = {Using detailed mock galaxy redshift surveys (MGRSs) we investigate the abundance and radial distribution of satellite galaxies. The mock surveys are constructed using large numerical simulations and the conditional luminosity function (CLF), and are compared against data from the Two Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS). We use Monte Carlo Markov chains to explore the full posterior distribution of the CLF parameter space, and show that the average relation between light and mass is tightly constrained and in excellent agreement with our previous models and with that of Vale & Ostriker. The radial number density distribution of satellite galaxies in the 2dFGRS reveals a pronounced absence of satellites at small projected separations from their host galaxies. This is (at least partly) owing to the overlap and merging of galaxy images in the 2dFGRS parent catalogue. Owing to the resulting close-pair incompleteness we are unfortunately unable to put meaningful constraints on the radial distribution of satellite galaxies; the data are consistent with a radial number density distribution that follows that of the dark matter particles, but we cannot rule out alternatives with a constant number density core. Marginalizing over the full CLF parameter space, we show that in a ΛCDM concordance cosmology the observed abundances of host and satellite galaxies in the 2dFGRS indicate a power spectrum normalization of σ8~= 0.7. The same cosmology but with σ8= 0.9 is unable to match simultaneously the abundances of host and satellite galaxies. This confirms our previous conclusions based on the pairwise peculiar velocity dispersions and the group multiplicity function. },

	Abstract = {We find that satellites of isolated disk galaxies at projected radii between 300 and 500 kpc are distributed asymmetrically about the parent galaxy and aligned preferentially with the disk minor axis. The dynamical timescale at these radii is sufficiently long that the shape of this distribution must reflect the formation history of the outer halo rather than its internal evolution. We also find that the orbital angular momenta of satellites at projected major axis distances of <~ 200 kpc tend to align with that of the central disk. These results demonstrate that satellites are dynamically related to their primary galaxy. Satellites drawn from current simulations of hierarchical galaxy formation exhibit neither the systematic alignment nor the net rotation with the central disk that we find in the data. },

	Abstract = {We have analysed a sample of satellite and primary galaxies in the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey. In our study we find strong statistical evidence of the Holmberg effect (that is, a tendency for satellites to avoid regions along the line defined by the primary plane) within 500 kpc of the projected distance to the primary. This effect is present only when we restrict our analysis to objects with radial velocity relative to the primary |Δv| < 160 km s-1, which corresponds approximately to the mean of the distribution. We explore the dependence of this anisotropy on spectral type (η), colours and luminosities of both primaries and satellites, finding that objects with a low present-day star formation rate present the most significant effect.},

In 1946, Eric Holmberg demonstrated that the size, shape, and integrated luminosity of a galaxy derived from measurements performed on its photographic image are more accurately determined with a photoelectric microphotometer than with visual methods alone. He found that the luminosity function depends on the morphological type of a galaxy and that the surface density of satellites in the polar sectors of a spiral galaxy is larger than in the equatorial sectors at corresponding radial intervals. },

	Abstract = {We use the integral-field spectrograph SAURON to measure the stellar line-of-sight velocity distribution and absorption line strengths out to four effective radii (Re) in the early-type galaxies NGC 3379 and 821. With our newly developed observing technique, we can now probe these faint regions in galaxies that were previously not accessible with traditional long-slit spectroscopy. We make optimal use of the large field-of-view and high throughput of the spectrograph: by adding the signal of all ~1400 lenslets into one spectrum, we obtain sufficient signal-to-noise in a few hours of observing time to reliably measure the absorption line kinematics and line strengths out to large radius.

We find that the line strength gradients previously observed within 1 Re remain constant out to at least 4 Re, which puts constraints on the merger histories of these galaxies. The stellar halo populations are old and metal poor. By constructing orbit-based Schwarzschild dynamical models, we find that dark matter is necessary to explain the observed kinematics in NGC 3379 and 821, with 30-50 per cent of the total matter being dark within 4 Re. The radial anisotropy in our best-fitting halo models is less than in our models without halo, due to differences in orbital structure. The halo also has an effect on the Mgb-Vesc relation: its slope is steeper when a dark matter halo is added to the model. },

@article{Metz:2007,
	Abstract = {There are two fundamentally different physical origins of faint satellite galaxies: cosmological substructures that contain shining baryons and the fragmentation of gas-rich tidal arms thrown out from interacting galaxies during hierarchical structure formation. The latter tidal dwarf galaxies (TDGs) may form populations with correlated orbital angular momenta about their host galaxies. The existence of TDGs is a stringent necessity because they arise as a result of fundamental physical principles. We determine the significance of the apparent disc-like distribution of Milky Way (MW) satellite galaxies. The distribution of the MW satellites is found to be inconsistent with an isotropic or prolate dark matter substructure distribution at a 99.5 per cent level including the recently discovered Ursa Major and Canes Venatici dwarf spheroidal galaxies. The distribution is extremely oblate and inclined by about 88$\,^{\circ}$ with respect to the the MW disc. We also apply the methods to Andromeda's (M31) satellite galaxies using two recently published data sets. It cannot be excluded that the whole population of M31 companions is drawn randomly from an isotropic parent distribution. However, two subsamples of Andromeda satellites are identified which have disc-like features. A kinematically motivated subsample of eight Andromeda satellites form a pronounced disc-like distribution in both data sets. The existence of this disc would be inconsistent with a cold dark matter parent distribution of subhaloes if the disc is rotationally supported. The M31 satellite distribution is inclined by about 59$\,^{\circ}$ with respect to the M31 disc, and has virtually the same orientation as the disc derived for the whole M31 satellite sample. We present a new geometric method to set restrictions on possible locations of angular momentum vectors for Andromeda satellites. Our conclusion is that both, the MW and M31, may indeed have satellite galaxies derived from TDGs. Further, both host-discs and both identified discs-of-satellites are highly inclined relative to the supergalactic plane. The discs-of-satellites therefore cannot be created from individual accretion events from the supergalactic plane further supporting the possibility that they are of TDG origin. },

@article{Reid:2009,
	Abstract = {We are using the Very Long Baseline Array and the Japanese VLBI Exploration of Radio Astronomy project to measure trigonometric parallaxes and proper motions of masers found in high-mass star-forming regions across the Milky Way. Early results from 18 sources locate several spiral arms. The Perseus spiral arm has a pitch angle of 16$\,^{\circ}$ $\pm$ 3$\,^{\circ}$, which favors four rather than two spiral arms for the Galaxy. Combining positions, distances, proper motions, and radial velocities yields complete three-dimensional kinematic information. We find that star-forming regions on average are orbiting the Galaxy ≈15 km s--1 slower than expected for circular orbits. By fitting the measurements to a model of the Galaxy, we estimate the distance to the Galactic center R 0 = 8.4 $\pm$ 0.6 kpc and a circular rotation speed Θ0 = 254 $\pm$ 16 km s--1. The ratio Θ0/R 0 can be determined to higher accuracy than either parameter individually, and we find it to be 30.3 $\pm$ 0.9 km s--1 kpc--1, in good agreement with the angular rotation rate determined from the proper motion of Sgr A*. The data favor a rotation curve for the Galaxy that is nearly flat or slightly rising with Galactocentric distance. Kinematic distances are generally too large, sometimes by factors greater than 2; they can be brought into better agreement with the trigonometric parallaxes by increasing Θ0/R 0 from the IAU recommended value of 25.9 km s--1 kpc--1 to a value near 30 km s--1 kpc--1. We offer a "revised" prescription for calculating kinematic distances and their uncertainties, as well as a new approach for defining Galactic coordinates. Finally, our estimates of Θ0 and Θ0/R 0, when coupled with direct estimates of R 0, provide evidence that the rotation curve of the Milky Way is similar to that of the Andromeda galaxy, suggesting that the dark matter halos of these two dominant Local Group galaxy are comparably massive. },

	Abstract = {A robust analysis of galaxy structural parameters, based on the modeling of bulge and disk brightnesses in the BVRH bandpasses, is presented for 121 face-on and moderately inclined late-type spirals. Each surface brightness (SB) profile is decomposed into a sum of a generalized S{\'e}rsic bulge and an exponential disk. The reliability and limitations of our bulge-to-disk (B/D) decompositions are tested with extensive simulations of galaxy brightness profiles (one-dimensional) and images (two-dimensional). We have used repeat observations to test the consistency of our decompositions. The average systematic model errors are <~20% and <~5% for the bulge and disk components, respectively. The final set of galaxy parameters is studied for variations and correlations in the context of profile type differences and wavelength dependencies. Galaxy types are divided into three classes according to their SB profile shapes: Freeman type I, type II, and a third ``transition'' class for galaxies whose profiles change from type II in the optical to type I in the infrared. Roughly 43%, 44%, and 13% of type I, type II, and transition galaxies, respectively, comprise our sample. Only type I galaxies, with their fully exponential disks, are adequately modeled by our two-component decompositions, and our main results focus on these profiles. We discuss possible interpretations of Freeman type II profiles. The S{\'e}rsic bulge shape parameter for nearby type I late-type spirals shows a range between n=0.1 and 2, but, on average, the underlying surface density profile for the bulge and disk of these galaxies is adequately described by a double-exponential distribution. The distribution of disk scale lengths shows a decreasing trend with increasing wavelength, consistent with a higher concentration of old stars or dust (or both) in the central regions relative to the outer disk. We confirm a coupling between the bulge and disk with a scale length ratio <re/h>=0.22+/-0.09, or <hbulge/hdisk>=0.13+/-0.06 for late-type spirals, in agreement with recent N-body simulations of disk formation. This ratio increases from ~0.20 for late-type spirals to ~0.24 for earlier types. These observations are consistent with bulges of late-type spiral galaxies being more deeply embedded in their host disk than earlier type bulges. Bulges and disks can thus preserve a nearly constant re/h but show a great range of SB for any given effective radius. The similar scaling relations for early- and late-type spirals suggest comparable formation and/or evolution scenarios for disk galaxies of all Hubble types. In the spirit of Courteau, de Jong, & Broeils but using our new, more extensive database, we interpret this result as further evidence for regulated bulge formation by redistribution of disk material to the galaxy center, in agreement with models of secular evolution of the disk. },

	Abstract = {Using the standard dynamical theory of spherical systems, we calculate the properties of spherical galaxies and clusters whose density profiles obey the universal form first obtained in high-resolution cosmological N-body simulations by Navarro, Frenk & White (NFW). We adopt three models for the internal kinematics: isotropic velocities, constant anisotropy and increasingly radial Osipkov-Merritt anisotropy. Analytical solutions are found for the radial dependence of the mass, gravitational potential, velocity dispersion, energy and virial ratio and we test their variability with the concentration parameter describing the density profile and amount of velocity anisotropy. We also compute structural parameters, such as half-mass radius, effective radius and various measures of concentration. Finally, we derive projected quantities, the surface mass density and line-of-sight as well as aperture-velocity dispersion, all of which can be directly applied in observational tests of current scenarios of structure formation. On the mass scales of galaxies, if constant mass-to-light is assumed, the NFW surface density profile is found to fit Hubble-Reynolds laws well. It is also well fitted by S{\'e}rsic R1/m laws, for m~=3, but in a much narrower range of m and with much larger effective radii than are observed. Assuming in turn reasonable values of the effective radius, the mass density profiles imply a mass-to-light ratio that increases outwards at all radii. },

	Abstract = {The highly anisotropic distribution and apparent alignment of the Galactic satellites in polar great planes begs the question of how common such distributions are. The satellite system of M31 is the only nearby system for which we currently have sufficiently accurate distances to study the three-dimensional satellite distribution. We present the spatial distribution of the 15 currently known M31 companions in a coordinate system centered on M31 and aligned with its disk. Through a detailed statistical analysis we show that the full satellite sample describes a plane that is inclined by -56$\,^{\circ}$ with respect to the poles of M31 and has an rms height of 100 kpc. At 88% the statistical significance of this plane is low, and it is unlikely to have a physical meaning. We note that the great stellar stream found near Andromeda is inclined to this plane by 7$\,^{\circ}$. Most of the M31 satellites are found within <+/-40$\,^{\circ}$ of M31's disk; i.e., there is little evidence for a Holmberg effect. If we confine our analysis to early-type dwarfs, we find a best-fit polar plane within 5$\,^{\circ}$-7$\,^{\circ}$ from the pole of M31. This polar great plane has a statistical significance of 99.7% and includes all dSphs (except for And II), M32, NGC 147, and PegDIG. The rms distance of these galaxies from the polar plane is 16 kpc. The nearby spiral M33 has a distance of only ~3 kpc from this plane, which points toward the M81 group. We discuss the anisotropic distribution of M31's early-type companions in the framework of three scenarios, namely, as remnants of the breakup of a larger progenitor, as a tracer of a prolate dark matter halo, and as a tracer of collapse along large-scale filaments. The first scenario requires that the breakup must have occurred at very early times and that the dwarfs continued to form stars thereafter to account for their stellar population content and luminosity-metallicity relation. The third scenario seems to be plausible, especially when considering the apparent alignment of our potential satellite filament with several nearby groups. The current data do not permit us to rule out any of the scenarios. Orbit information is needed to test the physical reality of the polar plane and of the different scenarios in more detail. },

	Abstract = {We investigate the ratio between the half-mass radii r_h of Galactic globular clusters and their Jacobi radii r_J given by the potential of the Milky Way and show that clusters with galactocentric distances R_{GC}>8 kpc fall into two distinct groups: one group of compact, tidally-underfilling clusters with r_h/r_J<0.05 and another group of tidally filling clusters which have 0.1 < r_h/r_J<0.3. We find no correlation between the membership of a particular cluster to one of these groups and its membership in the old or younger halo population. Based on the relaxation times and orbits of the clusters, we argue that compact clusters and most clusters in the inner Milky Way were born compact with half-mass radii r_h < 1 pc. Some of the tidally-filling clusters might have formed compact as well, but the majority likely formed with large half-mass radii. Galactic globular clusters therefore show a similar dichotomy as was recently found for globular clusters in dwarf galaxies and for young star clusters in the Milky Way. It seems likely that some of the tidally-filling clusters are evolving along the main sequence line of clusters recently discovered by Kuepper et al. (2008) and are in the process of dissolution. },

	Abstract = {We present near-infrared (NIR) surface photometry of a sample of 14 early-type spirals with observed rotation curves. In this first paper, we report the results of two-dimensional parametric and non-parametric decompositions to separate the bulge and disk components; the parametric bulge is modeled with a generalized exponential law of integer index n, and the disk with a simple exponential. We find that the derived bulge parameters, for a given galaxy, vary systematically with the bulge shape index n. The mean early-type bulge has a best-fit n = 2.6, and 80% of the sample has best n of 2 or 3. Bulges are rarely spherical; the median bulge intrinsic ellipticity is 0.33. The median early-type disk has (J-K)_d more than 0.1 mag bluer than the bulge, and a NIR disk surface brightness more than 1 mag arcsec(-2) brighter than later-type disks. Our data are consistent with the well-established correlation of both bulge and disk surface brightness with physical scale length, and we note that the location of bulges within this projection of the fundamental plane depends on their shape index n. In agreement with previous work, the ratios of bulge and disk scale lengths are consistent with a constant value r_e/r_d = 0.3; however, such value again depends on the bulge index n, implying that claims for a scale-free Hubble sequence may be premature.

	Abstract = {Using high-resolution collisionless N-body simulations we study the properties of tidal tails formed in the immediate vicinity of a two-component dwarf galaxy evolving in a static potential of the Milky Way (MW). The stellar component of the dwarf is initially in the form of a disk and the galaxy is placed on an eccentric orbit motivated by CDM-based cosmological simulations. We measure the orientation, density and velocity distribution of the stars in the tails. Due to the geometry of the orbit, in the vicinity of the dwarf, where the tails are densest and therefore most likely to be detectable, they are typically oriented towards the MW and not along the orbit. We report on an interesting phenomenon of `tidal tail flipping': on the way from the pericentre to the apocentre the old tails following the orbit are dissolved and new ones pointing towards the MW are formed over a short timescale. We also find a tight linear relation between the velocity of stars in the tidal tails and their distance from the dwarf. Using mock data sets we demonstrate that if dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies in the vicinity of the MW are tidally affected their kinematic samples are very likely contaminated by tidally stripped stars which tend to artificially inflate the measured velocity dispersion. The effect is stronger for dwarfs on their way from the peri- to the apocentre due to the formation of new tidal tails after pericentre. Realistic mass estimates of dSph galaxies thus require removal of these stars from kinematic samples. },

	Abstract = {Abstract: We review the properties of globular clusters which make them useful for studying the Galactic halo, Galactic chemical evolution, and the early stages of the formation of the Milky Way. We review the evidence that GCs have a chemical inventory similar to those of halo field stars. We discuss the abundance ratios for dSph galaxies and show that it is possible to have formed at least part the Galactic halo field stellar population by dissolving globular clusters and/or accreting dSph galaxies but only if this occurred at an early stage in the formation of the Galaxy. We review the constraints on halo formation timescales deduced from the low Mg isotopic ratios in metal-poor halo field dwarfs which indicate that AGB stars did not have time to contribute significantly, while M71 contains two populations, one without and also one with a substantial AGB contribution. We review the limited evidence for GCs with a second population showing additional contributions from SNII, currently confined to Omega Cen, M54, and M22, all of which may have been the nuclei or central regions of accreted galaxies. We check our own data for additional such GCs, and find preliminary indications that NGC 2419, a massive GC far in the outer Galactic halo, may also belong to this group. },

@article{Harris:2009,
	Abstract = {Images from the HST ACS are used to carry out a new photometric study of the globular clusters (GCs) in M104, the Sombrero galaxy. The primary focus of our study is the characteristic distribution function of linear sizes (SDF) of the GCs. We measure the effective radii for 652 clusters with PSF-convolved King and Wilson dynamical model fits. The SDF is remarkably similar to those measured for other large galaxies of all types, adding strong support to the view that it is a "universal" feature of globular cluster systems. We develop a more general interpretation of the size distribution function for globular clusters, proposing that the shape of the SDF that we see today for GCs is strongly influenced by the early rapid mass loss during their star forming stage, coupled with stochastic differences from cluster to cluster in the star formation efficiency (SFE) and their initial sizes. We find that the observed SDF shape can be accurately predicted by a simple model in which the protocluster clouds had characteristic sizes of $0.9 \pm 0.1$ pc and SFEs of $0.3 \pm 0.07$. The colors and luminosities of the M104 clusters show the clearly defined classic bimodal form. The blue sequence exhibits a mass/metallicity relation (MMR), following a scaling of heavy-element abundance with luminosity of $Z \sim L^{0.3}$ very similar to what has been found in most giant elliptical galaxies. A quantitative self-enrichment model provides a good first-order match to the data for the same initial SFE and protocluster size that were required to explain the SDF. We also discuss various forms of the globular cluster Fundamental Plane (FP) of structural parameters, and show that useful tests of it can be extended to galaxies beyond the Local Group. },

	Abstract = {While the connection between high-redshift star formation and the local universe has recently been used to understand the observed population of faint dwarf galaxies in the Milky Way (MW) halo, we explore how well these nearby objects can probe the epoch of first light. We construct a detailed, physically motivated model for the MW satellites based on the state-of-the-art Via Lactea II dark-matter simulations. Our model incorporates molecular hydrogen (H_2) cooling in low-mass systems and inhomogeneous photo-heating feedback during the internal reionization of our own galaxy. We find that the existence of MW satellites fainter than M_V ~ -5 is strong evidence for H_2 cooling in low-mass halos, while satellites with -5 > M_V > -9 were affected by hydrogen cooling and photoheating feedback. The age of stars in very low-luminosity systems and the minimum luminosity of these satellites are key predictions of our model. Most of the stars populating the brightest MW satellites could have formed after the epoch of reionization. Our models also predict a significantly larger dispersion in M_300 values than observed and a number of luminous satellites with M_300 as low as 10^6 solar masses.},

	Abstract = {Surface brightness profiles for 23 M31 star clusters were measured using images from the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 on the Hubble Space Telescope, and fit to two types of models to determine the clusters' structural properties. The clusters are primarily young (~10^8 yr) and massive (~10^4.5 solar masses), with median half-light radius 7 pc and dissolution times of a few Gyr. The properties of the M31 clusters are comparable to those of clusters of similar age in the Magellanic Clouds. Simulated star clusters are used to derive a conversion from statistical measures of cluster size to half-light radius so that the extragalactic clusters can be compared to young massive clusters in the Milky Way. All three sets of star clusters fall approximately on the same age-size relation. The young M31 clusters are expected to dissolve within a few Gyr and will not survive to become old, globular clusters. However, they do appear to follow the same fundamental plane relations as old clusters; if confirmed with velocity dispersion measurements, this would be a strong indication that the star cluster fundamental plane reflects universal cluster formation conditions. },

	Abstract = {Andromeda X (And X) is a newly discovered low-luminosity M31 dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph) found by Zucker et al. (2007) in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS - York et al. 2000). In this paper, we present the first spectroscopic study of individual red giant branch stars in And X, as a part of the SPLASH Survey (Spectroscopic and Photometric Landscape of Andromeda's Stellar Halo). Using the Keck II telescope and multiobject DEIMOS spectrograph, we target two spectroscopic masks over the face of the galaxy and measure radial velocities for ~100 stars with a median accuracy of sigma_v ~ 3 km/s. The velocity histogram for this field confirms three populations of stars along the sight line: foreground Milky Way dwarfs at small negative velocities, M31 halo red giants over a broad range of velocities, and a very cold velocity ``spike'' consisting of 22 stars belonging to And X with v_rad = -163.8 +/- 1.2 km/s. By carefully considering both the random and systematic velocity errors of these stars (e.g., through duplicate star measurements), we derive an intrinsic velocity dispersion of just sigma_v = 3.9 +/- 1.2 km/s for And X, which for its size, implies a minimum mass-to-light ratio of M/L =37^{+26}_{-19} assuming the mass traces the light. Based on the clean sample of member stars, we measure the median metallicity of And X to be [Fe/H] = -1.93 +/- 0.11, with a slight radial metallicity gradient. The dispersion in metallicity is large, sigma([Fe/H]) = 0.48, possibly hinting that the galaxy retained much of its chemical enrichment products. We discuss the potential for better understanding the formation and evolution mechanisms for M31's system of dSphs through (current) kinematic and chemical abundance studies, especially in relation to the Milky Way sample.

	Abstract = {We report on deep imaging of a remote M31 globular cluster, MGC1, obtained with Gemini/GMOS. Our colour-magnitude diagram for this object extends ~5 magnitudes below the tip of the red giant branch and exhibits features consistent with an ancient metal-poor stellar population, including a long, well-populated horizontal branch. The red giant branch locus suggests MGC1 has a metal abundance [M/H] ~ -2.3. We measure the distance to MGC1 and find that it lies ~160 kpc in front of M31 with a distance modulus of 23.95 +/- 0.06. Combined with its large projected separation of 117 kpc from M31 this implies a deprojected radius of Rgc = 200 +/- 20 kpc, rendering it the most isolated known globular cluster in the Local Group by some considerable margin. We construct a radial brightness profile for MGC1 and show that it is both centrally compact and rather luminous, with Mv = -9.2. Remarkably, the cluster profile shows no evidence for a tidal limit and we are able to trace it to a radius of at least 450 pc, and possibly as far as ~900 pc. The profile exhibits a power-law fall-off with exponent -2.5, breaking to -3.5 in its outermost parts. This core-halo structure is broadly consistent with expectations derived from numerical models, and suggests that MGC1 has spent many gigayears in isolation. },

	Abstract = {We present a photometric survey of the stellar halo of the Andromeda galaxy, using Suprime-Cam on the Subaru Telescope. A detailed analysis of VI color-magnitude diagrams of the resolved stellar population is used to measure properties such as line-of-sight distance, surface brightness, metallicity, and age, and these are used to isolate and characterize different components of the M31 halo: (1) several substructures, and (2) the smooth halo. First, we study M31's halo substructure along the north-west/south-east minor axis out to R ~ 100 kpc and the south-west major axis region at R ~ 60 kpc. We confirm two substructures in the south-east halo reported by Ibata et al. (2007) and discover two overdense substructures in the north-west halo. We investigate the properties of these four substructures as well as other structures including the western shelf and find that differences in stellar populations among these systems, thereby suggesting each has a different origin. Our statistical analysis implies that the M31 halo as a whole may contain at least 16 substructures, each with a different origin. Second, we investigate the properties of an underlying, smooth and extended halo component out to R > 100 kpc. We find that the surface density of this smooth halo can be fitted to a Hernquist model of scale radius ~ 17 kpc or a power-law profile with ~ R^{-2.17 +/- 0.15}. In contrast to the relative smoothness of the halo density profile, its metallicity distribution appears to be spatially non-uniform with non-monotonic variations with radius, suggesting that the halo may still be undergoing chemo-dynamical evolution. },

@article{McConnachie:2005,
	Abstract = {We have obtained Johnson V and Gunni photometry for a large number of Local Group galaxies using the Isaac Newton Telescope Wide Field Camera (INT WFC). The majority of these galaxies are members of the M31 subgroup and the observations are deep enough to study the top few magnitudes of the red giant branch in each system. We previously measured the location of the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) for Andromeda I, Andromeda II and M33 to within systematic uncertainties of typically <0.05 mag. As the TRGB acts as a standard candle in old, metal-poor stellar populations, we were able to derive distances to each of these galaxies. Here we derive TRGB distances to the giant spiral galaxy M31 and 13 additional dwarf galaxies - NGC 205, 185, 147, Pegasus, WLM, LGS3, Cetus, Aquarius, And III, V, VI, VII and the newly discovered dwarf spheroidal And IX. The observations for each of the dwarf galaxies were intentionally taken in photometric conditions. In addition to the distances, we also self-consistently derive the median metallicity of each system from the colour of their red giant branches. This allows us to take into account the small metallicity variation of the absolute I magnitude of the TRGB. The homogeneous nature of our data and the identical analysis applied to each of the 17 Local Group galaxies ensures that these estimates form a reliable set of distance and metallicity determinations that are ideal for comparative studies of Local Group galaxy properties. },

	Abstract = {We present new velocities for 62 globular clusters in M104 (NGC 4594, the Sombrero Galaxy), 56 from 2dF on the AAT and 6 from Hydra on WIYN. Combined with previous data, we have a total sample of 108 M104 globular cluster velocities, extending to 20' radius (~60 kpc), along with BVR photometry for each of these. We use this wide-field data set to study the globular cluster kinematics and dark matter content of M104 out to 10' radius (30 kpc). We find no rotation in the globular cluster system. The edge-on nature of M104 makes it unlikely that there is strong rotation which is face-on and hence unobserved; thus, the absence of rotation over our large radial range appears to be an intrinsic feature of the globular cluster system in M104. We discuss ways to explain this low rotation, including the possibility that angular momentum has been transferred to even larger radii through galaxy mergers. The cluster velocity dispersion is ~230 km s-1 within several arcminutes of the galaxy center, and drops to ~150 km s-1 at ~10' radius. We derive the mass profile of M104 using our velocity dispersion profile, together with the Jeans equation under the assumptions of spherical symmetry and isotropy, and find excellent agreement with the mass inferred from the stellar and gas rotation curve within 3' radius. The M/LV increases from ~4 near the galaxy center to ~17 at 7' radius (~20 kpc, or 4 Re), thus giving strong support for the presence of a dark matter halo in M104. More globular cluster velocities at larger radii are needed to further study the low rotation in the globular cluster system, and to see if the dark matter halo in M104 extends beyond a radius of 30 kpc. },

Expressions are presented for the uncertainty of a measured redshift, for the internal broadening of the object, and for the uncertainty of this broadening. Comparison of the optical data with previously published 21-cm data shows no systematic errors and yields excellent agreement with the internal error analysis. The method of analyzing velocity dispersions is quite promising for further application. A series of spectra are presented as examples to show the power and limitations of the correlation techniques. },

The models are derived from explicit distribution functions for each component, and the large number of parameters permit detailed modeling of actual galaxies. We present techniques that use structural and kinematic data such as radial surface brightness profiles, rotation curves, and bulge velocity dispersion profiles to find the best-fit models for the Milky Way and M31. Through N-body realizations of these models we explore their stability against the formation of bars.

	Abstract = {We describe methods for setting up self-consistent disc-bulge-halo galaxy models. The bulge and halo distribution functions (DFs) are functions of E and L_z_ only. The halo's flattening and rotation can be specified. The disc DF is a function of E and L_z_ and a third `integral', E_z_, the vertical energy, which is approximately conserved in a warm disc with vertical extent. The models also have finite extent, making them suitable for N-body simulation. A simulation of a sample model shows that in practice the models are very close to equilibrium, making them ideal for experiments on instabilities in galactic discs. We also present a sequence of models closely resembling the Milky Way mass distribution with 5 exponential scale radii and varying halo mass and radial extent. },

	Abstract = {We present a detailed study of the viewing angles of the LMC disk plane. We find that our viewing direction differs considerably from the commonly accepted values, which has important implications for the structure of the LMC. The discussion is based on an analysis of spatial variations in the apparent magnitude of features in the near-IR color-magnitude diagrams extracted from the Deep Near-Infrared Southern Sky Survey (DENIS) and Two Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS). Sinusoidal brightness variations with a peak-to-peak amplitude of ~0.25 mag are detected as a function of position angle. The same variations are detected for asymptotic giant branch stars (using the mode of their luminosity function) and for red giant branch stars (using the tip of their luminosity function), and these variations are seen consistently in all of the near-IR photometric bands in both DENIS and 2MASS data. The observed spatial brightness variations are naturally interpreted as the result of distance variations because of one side of the LMC plane being closer to us than the opposite side. There is no evidence that any complicating effects, such as possible spatial variations in dust absorption or the age/metallicity of the stellar population, cause large-scale brightness variations in the near-IR at a level that exceeds the formal errors (~0.03 mag). The best-fitting geometric model of an inclined plane yields an inclination angle i=34.7d+/-6.2d and line-of-nodes position angle Θ=122.5d+/-8.3d. The quoted errors are conservative estimates that take into account the possible influence of systematic errors; the formal errors are much smaller, 0.7d and 1.6d, respectively. There is tentative evidence for variations of ~10$\,^{\circ}$ in the viewing angles with distance from the LMC center, suggesting that the LMC disk plane may be warped. Traditional methods to estimate the position angle of the line of nodes have used either the major-axis position angle Θmaj of the spatial distribution of tracers on the sky or the position angle Θmax of the line of maximum gradient in the velocity field, given that for a circular disk Θmaj=Θmax=Θ. The present study does not rely on the assumption of circular symmetry and is considerably more accurate than previous studies of its kind. We find that the actual position angle of the line of nodes differs considerably from both Θmaj and Θmax, for which measurements have fallen in the range 140$\,^{\circ}$-190$\,^{\circ}$. This indicates that the intrinsic shape of the LMC disk is not circular but elliptical. Paper II of this series explores the implications of this result through a detailed study of the shape and structure of the LMC. The inclination angle inferred here is consistent with previous estimates, but this is to some extent a coincidence, given that also for the inclination angle most previous estimates were based on the incorrect assumption of circular symmetry. },

We transform these intermediate-band photometric data to the photometry in the standard UBVRI broad-bands. These M31 GC candidates are selected from the Revised Bologna Catalogue (RBC V.3.5), and most of these candidates do not have any photometric data. Therefore the present photometric data are supplement to RBC V.3.5. We find that 4 out of 61 GCs and GC candidates in RBC V.3.5 do not show any signal on the BATC images at their locations. By linear fit of the distribution in colour-magnitude diagram of blue GCs and GC candidates using the data from RBC V.3.5, and in this study we find the ``blue-tilt'' of blue M31 GCs with a high confidence at 99.95% or 3.47 sigma for the confirmed GCs, and >99.99% or 4.87 sigma for GCs and GC candidates. },

	Abstract = {We have obtained velocity dispersions from Keck high-resolution integrated spectroscopy of ten M31 globular clusters (GCs), including three candidate intermediate-age GCs. We show that these candidates have the same V-band mass-to-light (M/L_V) ratios as the other GCs, implying that they are likely to be old. We also find a trend of derived velocity dispersion with wavelength, but cannot distinguish between a systematic error and a physical effect. Our new measurements are combined with photometric and spectroscopic data from the literature in a reanalysis of all M31 GC M/L_V values. In a combined sample of 27 GCs, we show that the metal-rich GCs have *lower* M/L_V than the metal-poor GCs, in conflict with predictions from stellar population models. Fragmentary data for other galaxies support this observation. The M31 GC fundamental plane is extremely tight, and we follow up an earlier suggestion by Djorgovski to show that the fundamental plane can be used to estimate accurate distances (potentially 10% or better). },

	Abstract = {A new method of statistical analysis based on Bayes' theorem is devised and used directly to yield confidence intervals for the mass of the Galaxy once the eccentricity distribution of its satellites are specified. If the satellites have an isotropic velocity distribution, then the Galactic mass is less than about 5.2 x 10 to the 11th solar masses at the 95 percent confidence level. If the Galaxy is modeled as an infinite halo with constant circular speed v(c) and the velocities are isotropic, then the analysis predicts v(c) of less than about 165 km/s at the 95 percent confidence level. If the satellite orbits are more radial, then the estimates are lower. These results suggest that the Galaxy's massive dark halo extends to less than about 50 kpc from the Galactic center. },

@article{Klypin:2002,
	Abstract = {We apply standard disk formation theory with adiabatic contraction within cuspy halo models predicted by the standard cold dark matter (ΛCDM) cosmology. The resulting models are confronted with the broad range of observational data available for the Milky Way and M31 galaxies. We find that there is a narrow range of parameters that can satisfy the observational constraints, but within this range, the models score remarkably well. Our favored models have virial masses of 1012 and 1.6×1012 Msolar for the Galaxy and for M31, respectively, average spin parameters λ~0.03-0.05, and concentrations Cvir=10-17, typical for halos of this mass in the standard ΛCDM cosmology. The models require neither dark matter modifications nor flat cores to fit the observational data. We explore two types of models, with and without the exchange of angular momentum between the dark matter and the baryons. The models without exchange give reasonable rotation curves, fulfill constraints in the solar neighborhood, and satisfy constraints at larger radii, but they may be problematic for fast rotating central bars. We explore models in which the baryons experience additional contraction due to loss of angular momentum to the surrounding dark matter. These models produce similar global properties, but the dark matter is only a 25% of the total mass in the central 3 kpc region, allowing a fast rotating bar to persist. According to preliminary calculations, our model galaxies probably have sufficient baryonic mass in the central ~3.5 kpc to reproduce recent observational values of the optical depth to microlensing events toward the Galactic center. Our dynamical models unequivocally require that about 50% of all the gas inside the virial radius must not be in the disk or in the bulge, a result that is obtained naturally in standard semianalytic models. Assuming that the Milky Way is ``typical,'' we investigate whether the range of virial masses allowed by our dynamical models is compatible with constraints from the galaxy luminosity function. We find that if the Milky Way has a luminosity MK=-24.0, then these constraints are satisfied, but if it is more luminous (as expected if it lies on the Tully-Fisher relation), then the predicted space density is larger than the observed space density of galaxies of the corresponding luminosity by a factor of 1.5-2. We conclude that observed rotation curves and dynamical properties of ``normal'' spiral galaxies appear to be consistent with standard ΛCDM. },

The mass estimate is accompanied by considerable uncertainty caused by the small size of the data set; for example, the upper bound on the total mass is ~24×1011 Msolar, while the lower bound is ~3×1011 Msolar. These values are less than the most recent estimates of the most likely mass of the Milky Way halo. Bearing in mind all the uncertainties, a fair conclusion is that the M31 halo is roughly as massive as that of the Milky Way halo. There is no dynamical evidence for the widely held belief that M31 is more massive-it may even be less massive. Based in part on data collected at W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

@article{van-der-Marel:2002,
	Abstract = {We formulate a new and coherent understanding of the structure and dynamics of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and its orbit around and interaction with the Milky Way. Much of our understanding of these issues hinges on studies of the LMC line-of-sight kinematics. The observed velocity field includes contributions from the LMC rotation curve V(R'), the LMC transverse velocity vector vt, and the rate of inclination change di/dt. All previous studies have assumed di/dt=0. We show that this is incorrect and that, combined with uncertainties in vt, this has led to incorrect estimates of many important structural parameters of the LMC. We derive general expressions for the velocity field that we fit to kinematic data for 1041 carbon stars. We calculate vt by compiling and improving LMC proper-motion measurements from the literature, and we show that for known vt, all other model parameters are uniquely determined by the data. The position angle of the line of nodes is Θ=129.9d+/-6.0d, consistent with the value determined geometrically by van der Marel & Cioni in 2001. The rate of inclination change is di/dt=-0.37+/-0.22 mas yr-1=-103$\,^{\circ}$+/-61$\,^{\circ}$ Gyr-1. This is similar in magnitude to predictions from N-body simulations by M. Weinberg, which predict LMC disk precession and nutation due to Milky Way tidal torques. The LMC rotation curve V(R') has amplitude 49.8+/-15.9 km s-1. This is 40% lower than what has previously (and incorrectly) been inferred from studies of H I, carbon stars, and other tracers. The line-of-sight velocity dispersion has an average value σ=20.2+/-0.5 km s-1, with little variation as a function of radius. The dynamical center of the carbon stars is consistent with the center of the bar and the center of the outer isophotes, but it is offset by 1.2d+/-0.6d from the kinematic center of the H I. The enclosed mass inside the last data point is MLMC(8.9 kpc)=(8.7+/-4.3)×109 Msolar, more than half of which is due to a dark halo.

The LMC has a considerable vertical thickness; its V/σ=2.9+/-0.9 is less than the value for the Milky Way's thick disk (V/σ~3.9). Simple arguments for models stratified on spheroids indicate that the (out of plane) axial ratio could be ~0.3 or larger. Isothermal disk models for the observed velocity dispersion profile confirm the finding of Alves & Nelson that the scale height must increase with radius. A substantial thickness to the LMC disk is consistent with the simulations of Weinberg, which predict LMC disk thickening due to Milky Way tidal forces. These affect LMC structure even inside the LMC's tidal radius, which we calculate to be rt=15.0+/-4.5 kpc (i.e., 17.1d+/-5.1d). The new insights into LMC structure need not significantly alter existing predictions for the LMC's self-lensing optical depth, which to lowest order depends only on σ. The compiled proper-motion data imply an LMC transverse velocity vt=406 km s-1 in the direction of position angle 78.7d (with errors of ~40 km s-1 in each coordinate). This can be combined with the observed systemic line-of-sight velocity, vsys=262.2+/-3.4 km s-1, to calculate the LMC velocity in the Galactocentric rest frame. This yields vLMC=293+/-39 km s-1, with radial and tangential components vLMC,rad=84+/-7 km s-1 and vLMC,tan=281+/-41 km s-1, respectively. This is consistent with the range of velocities that has been predicted by models for the Magellanic Stream. The implied orbit of the LMC has an apocenter-to-pericenter distance ratio ~2.5:1, a perigalactic distance ~45 kpc, and a present orbital period around the Milky Way of ~1.5 Gyr. The constraint that the LMC is bound to the Milky Way provides a robust limit on the minimum mass and extent of the Milky Way dark halo: MMW>=4.3×1011 Msolar and rh>=39 kpc (68.3% confidence). Finally, we present predictions for the LMC proper-motion velocity field, and we discuss how measurements of this may lead to kinematic distance estimates for the LMC. },

@article{vdm,
	Abstract = {We present several different statistical methods to determine the transverse velocity vector of M31. The underlying assumptions are that the M31 satellites on average follow the motion of M31 through space and that the galaxies in the outer parts of the Local Group on average follow the motion of the Local Group barycenter through space. We apply the methods to the line-of-sight velocities of 17 M31 satellites, to the proper motions of the two satellites M33 and IC 10, and to the line-of-sight velocities of five galaxies near the Local Group turnaround radius, respectively. This yields four independent but mutually consistent determinations of the heliocentric M31 transverse velocities in the west and north directions, with weighted averages <vW>=-78+/-41 km s-1 and <vN>=-38+/-34 km s-1. The uncertainties correspond to proper motions of ~10 μas yr-1, which will be difficult to verify observationally within the next decade. The galactocentric tangential velocity of M31 is 42 km s-1, with 1 σ confidence interval Vtan<=56 km s-1. The implied M31-Milky Way orbit is bound if the total Local Group mass M exceeds 1.72+0.26-0.25×1012 Msolar. If the orbit is indeed bound, then the timing argument combined with the known age of the universe implies that M=5.58+0.85-0.72×1012 Msolar. This is on the high end of the allowed mass range suggested by cosmologically motivated models for the individual structure and dynamics of M31 and the Milky Way, respectively. It is therefore possible that the timing mass is an overestimate of the true mass, especially if one takes into account recent results from the Millenium Simulation that show that there is also a theoretical uncertainty of 41% (Gaussian dispersion) in timing mass estimates. The M31 transverse velocity implies that M33 is in a tightly bound orbit around M31. This may have led to some tidal deformation of M33. It will be worthwhile to search for observational evidence of this. },

	Abstract = {Proper motions for several Milky Way dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies have been determined using both ground- and space-based imaging. These measurements require long baselines and repeat observations, and typical errors are of order 10 mas century-1. In this Letter, we utilize the effect of ``perspective rotation'' to show that the systematic proper motion of some dSphs can be determined to a similar precision using only stellar line-of-sight velocities. We show that including the effects of small intrinsic rotation in dSphs increases the proper motion errors by about a factor of 2. We provide error projections for future data sets and show that proposed 30 m class telescopes will measure the proper motion of a few dSphs with mas century-1 precision. },

@article{Wilkinson:1999,
	Abstract = {A simple model for the Milky Way halo is presented. It has a flat rotation curve in the inner regions, but the density falls off sharply beyond an outer edge. This truncated, flat rotation curve (TF) model possesses a rich family of simple distribution functions which vary in velocity anisotropy. The model is used to estimate the total mass of the Milky Way halo using the latest data on the motions of satellite galaxies and globular clusters at Galactocentric radii greater than 20kpc. This comprises a data set of 27 objects with known distances and radial velocities, of which six also possess measured proper motions. Unlike earlier investigations, we find entirely consistent maximum likelihood solutions unaffected by the presence or absence of Leo I, provided both radial and proper motion data are used. The availability of the proper motion data for the satellites is crucial as, without them, the mass estimates with and without Leo I are inconsistent at the 99per cent confidence level. All these results are derived from models in which the velocity normalization of the halo potential is taken as ~220kms-1. A detailed analysis of the uncertainties in our estimate is presented, including the effects of the small data set, possible incompleteness or correlations in the satellite galaxy sample and the measurement errors. The most serious uncertainties come from the size of the data set, which may cause a systematic underestimate by a factor of 2, and the measurement errors, which cause a scatter in the mass of the order of a factor of 2. We conclude that the total mass of the halo is ~1.9-1.7+3.6x1012Msolar, while the mass within 50kpc is ~5.4-3.6+0.2x1011Msolar. In the near future, ground-based radial velocity surveys of samples of blue horizontal branch (BHB) stars are a valuable way to augment the sparse data set. A data set of ~200 radial velocities of BHB stars will reduce the uncertainty in the mass estimate to ~20per cent. In the coming decade, microarcsecond astrometry will be possible with the Space Interferometry Mission (SIM) and the Global Astrometry Interferometer for Astrophysics (GAIA) satellites. For example, GAIA can provide the proper motions of the distant dwarfs like Leo I to within +/-15kms-1 and the nearer dwarfs like Ursa Minor to within +/-1kms-1. This will also allow the total mass of the Milky Way to be found to ~20per cent. SIM and GAIA will also provide an accurate estimate of the velocity normalization of the halo potential at large radii. },

	Abstract = {With the ultimate aim of distinguishing between various models describing the formation of galaxy halos (e.g., radial or multiphase collapse and random mergers), we have completed a spectroscopic study of the globular cluster system of M31. We present the results of deep intermediate-resolution fiber-optic spectroscopy of several hundred of the M31 globular clusters using the Wide Field Fibre Optic Spectrograph at the William Herschel Telescope in La Palma, Canary Islands. These observations have yielded precise radial velocities (+/-12 km s-1) and metallicities (+/-0.26 dex) for over 200 members of the M31 globular cluster population out to a radius of 1.5d from the galaxy center. Many of these clusters have no previous published radial velocity or [Fe/H] estimates, and the remainder typically represent significant improvements over earlier determinations. We present analyses of the spatial, kinematic, and metal abundance properties of the M31 globular clusters. We find that the abundance distribution of the cluster system is consistent with a bimodal distribution with peaks at [Fe/H]~-1.4 and -0.5. The metal-rich clusters demonstrate a centrally concentrated spatial distribution with a high rotation amplitude, although this population does not appear significantly flattened and is consistent with a bulge population. The metal-poor clusters tend to be less spatially concentrated and are also found to have a strong rotation signature. },

	Abstract = {We have explored the hypothesis that the total mass-ratio of the two main galaxies of the Local Group: Andromeda Galaxy(M31) and the Milky Way (MW) can be constrained measuring the tidal force induced by the surrounding mass distribution, M31 included, on the MW. We argue that the total mass-ratio between the two groups can be approximated, at least qualitatively, finding the tidal radius where the internal binding force of the MW balances the external tidal force acting on it. Since M31 is the massive tidal perturber of the local environment, we have used a wide range of M31 to MW mass-ratio combinations to compute the corresponding tidal radii. Of them, only few match the distance of the zero-tidal shell i.e. the shell identified observationally by the outermost dwarf galaxies which do not show any sign of tidal effects. This is the key to constrain the best mass-ratio interval of the two galaxies. Our results favour a solution where the mass-ratio ranges from 2 to 3 implying a massive predominance of M31. },

	Abstract = {We present far-ultraviolet photometry obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope of the low-mass X-ray binary 4U 0513-40 in the globular cluster NGC 1851. Our observations reveal a clear, roughly sinusoidal periodic signal with $P \simeq 17$ min and amplitude 3%-10%. The signal appears fully coherent and can be modelled as a simple reprocessing effect associated with the changing projected area presented by the irradiated face of a white dwarf donor star in the system. All of these properties suggest that the signal we have detected is orbital in nature, thus confirming 4U 0513-40 as an ultracompact X-ray binary (UCXB). All four confirmed UCXBs in globular clusters have orbital periods below 30 minutes, whereas almost all UCXBs in the Galactic field have orbital periods longer than this. This suggests that the dynamical formation processes dominate UCXB production in clusters, producing a different orbital period distribution than observed among field UCXBs. Based on the likely system parameters, we show that 4U 0513-40 should be a strong gravitational wave source and may be detectable by LISA over the course of a multi-year mission. },

@article{Cote:1998,
	Abstract = {We examine the formation of giant elliptical galaxies using their globular cluster (GC) systems as probes of their evolutionary history. The bimodal distributions of GC metallicities in such galaxies are often cited as evidence for the formation of giant elliptical galaxies through mergers involving gas-rich spirals, with the metal-rich GCs forming during the merger process. We explore an alternative possibility: that these metal-rich clusters represent the galaxy's intrinsic GC population and the metal-poor component of the observed GC metallicity distribution arises from the capture of GCs from other galaxies, either through mergers or through tidal stripping. Starting with plausible assumptions for the luminosity function of galaxies in the host cluster and for the dependence of GC metallicity on parent galaxy luminosity, we show using Monte Carlo simulations that the growth of a preexisting seed galaxy through mergers and tidal stripping is accompanied naturally by the capture of metal-poor GCs whose chemical abundances are similar to those that are observed to surround giant ellipticals. We also investigate the spatial distribution of GCs in isolated galaxies of low and intermediate luminosity and conclude that, at the epoch of formation, the GC systems of such galaxies are likely to have been more spatially extended than their constituent stars. Thus, the capture of GCs through tidal stripping, unlike mergers, does not necessarily conserve GC specific frequency. Comparisons of model GC metallicity distributions and specific frequencies to those observed for the well-studied galaxies NGC 4472 (=M49) and NGC 4486 (=M87), the two brightest cluster members of the nearby Virgo cluster, show that it is possible to explain their bimodal GC metallicity distributions and discordant specific frequencies without resorting to the formation of new GCs in mergers or by invoking multiple bursts of GC formation. Finally, we discuss the possibility of using the ratio of the numbers of metal-poor to metal-rich GCs in giant elliptical galaxies as a diagnostic of their merger histories. We use this method to derive upper limits on the number of galaxies and total luminosity accreted to date by NGC 4472. },

	Abstract = {We report the first results from deep ACS imaging of 10 classical globular clusters in the far outer regions (15 kpc<~Rp<~100 kpc) of M31. Eight of the clusters, including two of the most remote M31 globular clusters presently known, are described for the first time. Our F606W, F814W color-magnitude diagrams extend ~3 mag below the horizontal branch and clearly demonstrate that the majority of these objects are old (>~10 Gyr), metal-poor clusters. Five have [Fe/H] ~ -2.1, while an additional four have -1.9 <~ [Fe/H] <~ -1.5. The remaining object is more metal-rich, with [Fe/H] ~ -0.70. Several clusters exhibit the second-parameter effect. Using aperture photometry, we estimate integrated luminosities and structural parameters for all clusters. Many, including all four clusters with projected radii greater than 45 kpc, are compact and very luminous, with -8.9 <~ MV <~ -8.3. These four outermost clusters are thus quite unlike their Milky Way counterparts, which are typically diffuse, subluminous (-6.0 <~ MV <~ -4.7), and more metal-rich (-1.8 <~ [Fe/H] <~ -1.3).

Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555. These observations are associated with program 10394. },

In the cluster core, we find that the cluster's SGB exhibits a clear spread in luminosity, with at least two distinct components: a brighter one with a spread that is real but not bimodal, and a second one about 0.05 mag fainter, containing about 10% of the stars. In a less crowded field 6 arcminutes from the center, we find that the MS is broadened much more than can be accounted for by photometric errors, and that this broadening increases at fainter magnitudes. },

	Abstract = {We have used data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 5 to explore the overall structure and substructure of the stellar halo of the Milky Way using ~4 million color-selected main-sequence turnoff stars with 0.2<g-r<0.4 and 18.5<=r<22.5. We fit oblate and triaxial broken power law models to the data, and found a ``best-fit'' oblateness of the stellar halo 0.5<c/a<0.8, and halo stellar masses between galactocentric radii of 1 and 40 kpc of 3.7+/-1.2×108 Msolar. The density profile of the stellar halo is approximately ρ~r-α, where -2>α>-4. Yet, we found that all smooth and symmetric models were very poor fits to the distribution of stellar halo stars because the data exhibit a great deal of spatial substructure. We quantified deviations from a smooth oblate/triaxial model using the rms of the data around the model profile on scales >~100 pc, after accounting for the (known) contribution of Poisson uncertainties. Within the DR5 area of the SDSS, the fractional rms deviation σ/total of the actual stellar distribution from any smooth, parameterized halo model is >~40%: hence, the stellar halo is highly structured. We compared the observations with simulations of galactic stellar halos formed entirely from the accretion of satellites in a cosmological context by analyzing the simulations in the same way as the SDSS data. While the masses, overall profiles, and degree of substructure in the simulated stellar halos show considerable scatter, the properties and degree of substructure in the Milky Way's halo match well the properties of a ``typical'' stellar halo built exclusively out of the debris from disrupted satellite galaxies. Our results therefore point toward a picture in which an important fraction of the stellar halo of the Milky Way has been accreted from satellite galaxies. },

	Abstract = {We have measured the amount of kinematic substructure in the Galactic halo using the final dataset from the Spaghetti project, a pencil-beam high latitude sky survey. Our sample contains 101 photometrically selected and spectroscopically confirmed giants with accurate distance, radial velocity and metallicity information. We have developed a new clustering estimator: the "4distance" measure, which when applied to our dataset leads to the identification of 1 group and 7 pairs of clumped stars. The group, with 6 members, can confidently be matched to tidal debris of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. Two pairs match the properties of known Virgo structures. Using models of the disruption of Sagittarius in Galactic potentials with different degrees of dark halo flattening, we show that this favors a spherical or prolate halo shape, as demonstrated by Newberg et al. (2007) using SDSS data. One additional pair can be linked to older Sagittarius debris. We find that 20% of the stars in the Spaghetti dataset are in substructures. From comparison with random datasets we derive a very conservative lower limit of 10% to the amount of substructure in the halo. However, comparison to numerical simulations shows that our results are also consistent with a halo entirely built up from disrupted satellites, provided the dominating features are relatively broad due to early merging or relatively heavy progenitor satellites. },

@article{Ibata:1995,
	Abstract = {We have discovered a new Galactic satellite galaxy in the constellation of Sagittarius. The Sagittarius dwarf galaxy subtends an angle of ~10 deg on the sky, lies at a distance of 24 kpc and is comparable in size and luminosity to the largest dwarf spheroidal, Fornax. The new galaxy has many features in common with the other eight Galactic dwarf spheroidal systems, including an extended low-density spatial structure, a well-populated red horizontal branch with a blue extension, and a substantial carbon star population. In terms of stellar populations it most closely resembles the Fornax dwarf, having a strong intermediate-age stellar component and evidence of a metallicity spread. Sagittarius is the nearest galaxy known and currently lies only ~16 kpc from the centre of the Milky Way. Isodensity maps show it to be markedly elongated along a direction pointing towards the Galactic Centre, and suggest that it has been tidally distorted. The close proximity to the Galactic Centre, the morphological appearance and the radial velocity of 140 km s^-1 indicate that this system must have undergone at most very few close orbital encounters with the Milky Way. It is currently undergoing strong tidal disruption prior to being integrated into the Galaxy. We find that at least some of the four globular clusters, M54, Arp 2, Ter 7 and Ter 8, are associated with the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, and will probably share the fate of their progenitor. The Sagittarius dwarf galaxy was found serendipitously using a combination of UK Schmidt Telescope sky survey plates, the APM automatic plate measuring facility and the Anglo-Australian Telescope multifibre spectrograph, AUTOFIB. },

@article{Cote:1999,
	Abstract = {The High-Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES) on the Keck I telescope has been used to measure the first radial velocities for stars belonging to 11 heavily reddened globular clusters in the direction of the inner Galaxy. The sample consists of the clusters Terzan 3, NGC 6256, IC 1257, NGC 6380 (=Ton 1), Ton 2 (=Pismis 26), Djorg 1, NGC 6540 (=Djorg 3), IC 1276 (=Pal 7), Terzan 12, NGC 6749, and Pal 10. Candidate cluster members were selected from a combination of previously published color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) and new instrumental CMDs obtained with the Palomar 1.5 m telescope. The systemic velocities of Djorg 1 and Pal 10 should be considered provisional, since velocities are available for only two stars. For the remaining nine clusters, we have measured radial velocities for three to nine member stars. Using our HIRES spectra, we estimate metallicities of [Fe/H]~=-0.75 for both Terzan 3 and IC 1276, two clusters lacking previous metallicity estimates. The question of kinematic substructuring among the Galactic globular clusters is investigated using an updated catalog of globular cluster distances, metallicities, and velocities. It is found that the population of metal-rich globular clusters shows significant rotation at all Galactocentric radii. For the metal-rich clusters within 4 kpc of the Galactic center, the measured rotation velocity and line-of-sight velocity dispersion are similar to those of bulge field stars. We investigate claims that the metal-rich clusters are associated with the central Galactic bar by comparing the kinematics of the innermost clusters to that of the atomic hydrogen in the inner Galaxy. The longitude-velocity diagram of both metal-rich and metal-poor clusters bears a remarkable similarity to that of the gas, including the same noncircular motions that have traditionally been interpreted as evidence for a Galactic bar, or, alternatively, a nonaxisymmetric bulge. However, uncertainties in the existing three-dimensional Galactocentric positions for most of the clusters do not yet allow an unambiguous discrimination between the competing scenarios of membership in a rigidly rotating bar or in a bulge that is an oblate isotropic rotator. We conclude that the majority of metal-rich clusters within the central ~4 kpc of the Galaxy are probably associated with the bulge/bar, and not the thick disk. },

Second-parameter effects are linked to cluster kinematics, and hence to the history of proto-Galactic collapse.

On the basis of kinematics, spatial distribution, and metallicity, we argue that these clusters may be associated with the galactic bulge (as concluded by Frenk & White 1982) rather than with the thick disk. On the basis of the available ages for some of these clusters, it is argued that the glactic bulge formed after the halo. Different formation senarios of the galaxy are examined, and it is concluded that dissapation played a major role in the inner 3 kpc. },

@article{Palma:2002,
	Abstract = {In numerous studies of the outer Galactic halo some evidence for accretion has been found. If the outer halo did form in part or wholly through merger events, we might expect to find coherent streams of stars and globular clusters following orbits similar to those of their parent objects, which are assumed to be present or former Milky Way dwarf satellite galaxies. We present a study of this phenomenon by assessing the likelihood of potential descendant ``dynamical families'' in the outer halo. We conduct two analyses: one that involves a statistical analysis of the spatial distribution of all known Galactic dwarf satellite galaxies (DSGs) and globular clusters, and a second, more specific analysis of those globular clusters and DSGs for which full phase space dynamical data exist. In both cases our methodology is appropriate only to members of descendant dynamical families that retain nearly aligned orbital poles today. Since the Sagittarius dwarf (Sgr) is considered a paradigm for the type of merger/tidal interaction event for which we are searching, we also undertake a case study of the Sgr system and identify several globular clusters that may be members of its extended dynamical family. In our first analysis, the distribution of possible orbital poles for the entire sample of outer (Rgc>8 kpc) halo globular clusters is tested for statistically significant associations among globular clusters and DSGs. Our methodology for identifying possible associations is similar to that used by Lynden-Bell & Lynden-Bell, but we put the associations on a more statistical foundation. Moreover, we study the degree of possible dynamical clustering among various interesting ensembles of globular clusters and satellite galaxies. Among the ensembles studied, we find the globular cluster subpopulation with the highest statistical likelihood of association with one or more of the Galactic DSGs to be the distant, outer halo (Rgc>25 kpc), second-parameter globular clusters. The results of our orbital pole analysis are supported by the great circle cell count methodology of Johnston, Hernquist, & Bolte. The space motions of the clusters Pal 4, NGC 6229, NGC 7006, and Pyxis are predicted to be among those most likely to show the clusters to be following stream orbits, since these clusters are responsible for the majority of the statistical significance of the association between outer halo, second-parameter globular clusters and the Milky Way DSGs. In our second analysis, we study the orbits of the 41 globular clusters and six Milky Way-bound DSGs having measured proper motions to look for objects with both coplanar orbits and similar angular momenta. Unfortunately, the majority of globular clusters with measured proper motions are inner halo clusters that are less likely to retain memory of their original orbit. Although four potential globular cluster/DSG associations are found, we believe three of these associations involving inner halo clusters to be coincidental. While the present sample of objects with complete dynamical data is small and does not include many of the globular clusters that are more likely to have been captured by the Milky Way, the methodology we adopt will become increasingly powerful as more proper motions are measured for distant Galactic satellites and globular clusters, and especially as results from the Space Interferometry Mission (SIM) become available. },

	Abstract = {Distance moduli for 111 globular clusters are presented which were obtained from color-magnitude diagrams or on the basis of horizontal-branch magnitudes, 25 brightest cluster stars, photographic measurements of RR Lyrae variables, cluster luminosities, or the degree of visual resolution of cluster stars. The space coordinates of the clusters are calculated, and the distance information is applied to determine the true centroid of the cluster system as well as the distance to the galactic center. A value of 8.5 kpc is adopted for the latter, uncertainties in this determination are evaluated, and the total number of globular clusters in the Galaxy is estimated to be about 170. The space distribution of metallicity groups among the clusters is investigated along with the ellipticity of the cluster system, the three-dimensional density distribution in the system, and the relation between this distribution and metallicity. The relation of the outermost halo objects to the normal cluster system is briefly discussed, and a rough estimate of the total halo mass is obtained by assuming that the mass distribution of Population II halo stars is similar to the space distribution of the globular clusters. },

	Abstract = {The spatial distributions, kinematics, and metallicities of 121 globular clusters are examined for evidence of distinct subpopulations in the cluster system. Clusters more metal-poor than (Fe/H) = -0.8 constitute the familiar halo population, while clusters more metal-rich than (Fe/H) = -0.8 have the properties of a disk system. There is a shallow but significant metallicity gradient with R in the halo population. The central concentrations and ellipticities of the halo and disk clusters are similar, while the latter are more evenly distributed in luminosity than the former. Excellent agreement is found between the properties of globular clusters and those of RR Lyrae variables and subdwarfs when these are also divided by metallicity at (Fe/H) = -0.8, which suggests that clusters are good tracers of the halo and old disk stellar populations. The scale height of the disk clusters appears to be about 500 pc, and it is argued that disk clusters are relics of a transient, thick-disk phase in the evolution of the Galaxy. },

	Abstract = {Lynden-Bell first demonstrated that the satellites of the Milky Way appear situated along two great 'streams' in the sky: the 'Magellanic stream' and the 'Fornax-Leo-Sculptor (FLS) stream.' Further exploration of the three-dimensional distribution of Galactic satellites reveals that the recently discovered Sextans and Phoenix dwarf spheroidal galaxies also lie near the plane defined by the FLS galaxies, and therefore strengthens the evidence in favor of the FLS stream. Moreover, a specific group of globular clusters -- those exhibiting the reddest horizontal branches (HBs) among those identified as 'young halo' by Zinn -- appear to populate the FLS stream. As previously demonstrated by Zinn, the spatial distribution of old halo globulars appears to be flattened toward the Galactic plane, and therefore the old halo clusters are typically anti-correlated to the nearly orthogonal FLS stream. A scenario is postulated wherein the Galactic satellites of the FLS stream and the red HB, young halo globular clusters share a common origin in the accretion of a formerly larger, parent satellite galaxy or Searle & Zinn 'fragment.'},

	Abstract = {Twelve of the 21 globular clusters and dwarf spheroidal galaxies lying between 25 and 250 kpc from the Galaxy lie within a narrow zone not more than 6 deg from a great circle, as seen from the Galactic center. Although this planar distribution is inclined by 35 deg to the Magellanic Stream, it can be shown that both may originate in a single encounter disrupting the outer parts of a low-mass 'victim'. Color-magnitude investigations and RR Lyrae variables of the stellar systems, as well as composition differences between the Magellanic Stream and the planar distribution, point to a considerable age for the major portion of stellar debris, placing the more violent disruptive episode earlier than the current perigalactic pass of the Magellanic Clouds. Given that the Stream itself, as well as the young stellar content of the Wing of the SMC, point to a recent disruptive event, at least two disruptive encounters must have occurred. Computer simulation, following methods developed by Toomre, were used to generate a family of models for the formation of the Magellanic Stream that broadly match both the spatial and the velocity distributions of both the gaseous and the stellar components. Agreement in the scaling of velocity is obtained by deepening the Galactic potential with a massive halo, consistent with the formulations of Ostriker et al. (1974) and Einasto et al. (1974).},

	Abstract = {This letter presents the analysis of candidate qLMXBs observed during a short Chandra/ACIS observation of the globular cluster (GC) NGC 6304. Two out of the three candidate qLMXBs of this cluster, XMMU 171433-292747 and XMMU 171421-292917, lie within the field of view. This permits comparison with the discovery observation of these sources. The one in the GC core -- XMMU 171433-292747 -- is spatially resolved into two separate X-ray sources, one of which is consistent with a pure H-atmosphere qLMXB, and the other is an X-ray power-law spectrum source. These two spectral components separately account for those observed from XMMU 171433-292747 in its discovery observation. We find that the observed flux and spectral parameters of the H-atmosphere spectral components are consistent with the previous observation, as expected from a qLMXB powered by deep crustal heating. XMMU 171421-292917 also has neutron star atmosphere spectral parameters consistent with those in the XMM-Newton observation and the observed flux has decreased by a factor 0.54^{+0.30}_{-0.24}. },

	Abstract = {We present a spectroscopic survey of candidate red giant branch stars in the extended star cluster, EC4, discovered in the halo of M31 from our CFHT/MegaCam survey, overlapping the tidal streams, Stream Cp and Stream Cr. These observations used the DEep Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph (DEIMOS) mounted on the Keck II telescope to obtain spectra around the CaII triplet region with ~1.3 Angstroms resolution. Six stars lying on the red giant branch within 2 core-radii of the centre of EC4 are found to have an average vr=-287.9^{+1.9}_{-2.4}km/s and velocity dispersion of 2.7^{+4.2}_{-2.7}km/s, taking instrumental errors into account. The resulting mass-to-light ratio for EC4 is M/L=6.7^{+15}_{-6.7}Msun/Lsun, a value that is consistent with a globular cluster within the 1 sigma errors we derive. From the summed spectra of our member stars, we find EC4 to be metal-poor, with [Fe/H]=-1.6+/-0.15. We discuss several formation and evolution scenarios which could account for our kinematic and metallicity constraints on EC4, and conclude that EC4 is most comparable with an extended globular cluster. We also compare the kinematics and metallicity of EC4 with Stream Cp and Stream Cr, and find that EC4 bears a striking resemblance to Stream Cp in terms of velocity, and that the two structures are identical in terms of both their spectroscopic and photometric metallicities. From this we conclude that EC4 is likely related to Stream Cp.},

	Abstract = {We will determine the kinematic behaviour of ∼170 previously unstudied globular clusters (GCs) and GC 
candidates in the outer halo of M31, and explore the halo kinematics of that nearby galaxy to unprecedented

(the former of which has been much studied), and determine the distinct kinematical signature of the latter. 
Much-improved global mass estimates will be derived for the dark matter and luminous halo of M31, and, 
with reference to theoretical models and simulations, we will explore any kinematic evidence indicative of 
streaming and recent accretion events. 
To accomplish these important objectives, we will use the MOS-ARGUS instrument at CFHT in IFU mode 
(as a ``visitor'' instrument, through pre-arrangement with the CFHT Director). This instrument is nothing 
short of ideal for the proposed survey, which will yield an outer-halo sample of precision dynamical tracers in 
M31 at least an order of magnitude larger than currently available.},

@article{Caldwell:2009,
	Abstract = {We present an updated catalog of 1300 objects in the field of M31, including 670 likely star clusters of various types, the rest being stars or background galaxies once thought to be clusters. The coordinates in the catalog are accurate to 0farcs2, and are based on images from the Local Group Survey (LGS) or from the Digitized Sky Survey (DSS). Archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images and the LGS were inspected to confirm cluster classifications where possible, but most of the classifications are based on spectra taken of ~1000 objects with the Hectospec fiber positioner and spectrograph on the 6.5 m MMT. The spectra and images of young clusters are analyzed in detail in this paper; analysis of older clusters will appear in a later paper. Ages and reddenings of 140 young clusters are derived by comparing the observed spectra with model spectra. Seven of these clusters also have ages derived from HST color-magnitude diagrams (two of which we present here); these agree well with the spectroscopically determined ages. Combining new V-band photometry with the M/L values that correspond to the derived cluster ages, we derive masses for the young clusters, finding them to have masses as great as 105 with a median of 104 M sun, and a median age of 0.25 Gyr. In comparison, therefore, Milky Way (MW) open clusters have the lowest median mass, the MW and M31 globulars the highest, and the LMC young massive clusters and the M31 young clusters are in between. The young clusters in M31 show a range of structures. Most have the low concentration typical of MW open clusters, but there are a few which have high concentrations. We expect that most of these young clusters will be disrupted in the next Gyr or so; however, some of the more massive and concentrated of the young clusters will likely survive for longer. The spatial distribution of the young clusters is well correlated with the star-forming regions as mapped out by mid-IR emission. A kinematic analysis likewise confirms the spatial association of the young clusters with the star-forming young disk in M31. },

	Abstract = {We use data from the Isaac Newton Telescope Wide-Field Camera survey of M31 to determine the surface brightness profile of M31 along the southeast minor axis. We combine surface photometry and faint red giant branch star counts to trace the profile from the innermost regions out to a projected radius of 4$\,^{\circ}$ (~55 kpc), where μV~32 mag arcsec-2 this is the first time the M31 minor-axis profile has been mapped over such a large radial distance using a single data set. We confirm the finding by Pritchet & van den Bergh that the minor-axis profile can be described by a single de Vaucouleurs law out to a projected radius of 1.4d or ~20 kpc. Beyond this, the surface brightness profile flattens considerably and is consistent with either a power law of index about -2.3 or an exponential of scale length 14 kpc. The fraction of the total M31 luminosity contained in this component is ~2.5%. While it is tempting to associate this outer component with a true Population II halo in M31, we find that the mean color of the stellar population remains roughly constant at V-i~1.6 from 0.5d to 3.5d along the minor axis. This result suggests that the same metal-rich stellar population dominates both structural components.

	Abstract = {A method of abundance determination based on reddening-independent properties of low-resolution spectral scans is described and applied to 177 red giants in 19 globular clusters, most of which are at galactocentric distances in excess of 8 kpc. The general properties of the halo-cluster system inferred from the abundance results are examined. It is found that the distribution over abundance of the halo globular clusters is independent of galactocentric distance for distances exceeding 8 kpc and that the clusters exhibit differences in the morphology of their color-magnitude diagrams that are uncorrelated with metal abundance. The characteristics of the system of halo clusters are compared with implications of some simple conceptual schemes for the formation of the Galaxy. It is suggested that the halo clusters originated within transient protogalactic fragments that gradually lost gas while undergoing chemical evolution and continued to fall into the Galaxy after the collapse of its central regions had been completed.},

	Abstract = {Globular clusters in the outer halo (Rgc > 15kpc) are found to be systematically fainter than those at smaller Galactocentric distances. Within the outer halo the compact clusters with half-light radii Rh < 10pc are only found at Rgc < 40kpc, while on the other hand the larger clusters with Rh > 10pc are encountered at all Galactocentric distances. Among the compact clusters with Rh < 10pc that have Rgc > 15kpc, there are two objects with surprisingly high metallicities. One of these is Terzan 7, which is a companion of the Sagittarius dwarf. The other is Palomar 1. The data on these two objects suggests that they might have had similar evolutionary histories. It is also noted that, with one exception, luminous globular clusters in the outer halo are all compact whereas faint ones may have any radius. This also holds for globular clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud, Small Magellanic Cloud and Fornax dwarf. The lone exception is the large luminous globular NGC 2419. Possibly this object is not a normal globular cluster, but the stripped core of a former dwarf spheroidal. In this respect it may resemble ω Centauri.},

@article{Mackey:2005,
	Abstract = {In this paper we compare the properties of three subsystems of Galactic globular clusters, which are defined according to metallicity and horizontal branch morphology. We specifically focus on cluster luminosities, structures, surface brightnesses and ellipticities. It is shown that the so-called `young' halo (YH) clusters, which are thought to have formed in external satellite galaxies, exhibit characteristics which are clearly distinct from those of the `old' halo (OH) and bulge/disc (BD) clusters, the majority of which are believed to be Galactic natives. The properties of the YH objects are, in many respects, similar to those of clusters belonging to a number of present-day satellite dwarf galaxies. The OH and BD populations have apparently been strongly modified by destructive tidal forces and shocks in the inner Galaxy. By comparing the properties of the three cluster subsystems, we estimate that the present population of native Galactic clusters may only represent approximately two-thirds of the original population. Several clusters with low surface brightnesses are observed to be highly flattened. We briefly speculate on the possibility that this ellipticity reflects the intrinsic flattening of dark matter mini-haloes in which these optically dim clusters might be embedded. Finally, we examine the distribution of clusters on the size (logRh) versus luminosity (MV) plane. Three objects are seen to fall well above the sharp upper envelope of the main distribution of clusters on the size-luminosity plane: ω Centauri, M54 and NGC 2419. All three of these objects have previously, and independently, been suggested to be the stripped cores of former dwarf galaxies. This suspicion is strengthened by the additional observation that the massive cluster G1 in M31 plus a number of the most luminous clusters in NGC 5128 also fall in the same region of the logRh versus MV plane. All of the latter objects have previously been suggested as the stripped cores of now defunct dwarf galaxies.},

	Abstract = {The ACS Survey of Galactic Globular Clusters, an HST Treasury Project, will deliver high-quality, homogeneous photometry of 65 globular clusters. This paper introduces a new collection of stellar evolution tracks and isochrones suitable for analyzing the ACS survey data. Stellar evolution models were computed at [Fe/H]=-2.5, -2.0, -1.5, -1.0, -0.5, and 0; [α/Fe]=-0.2, 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8; and three initial He abundances for masses from 0.1 to 1.8 Msolar and ages from 2 to 15 Gyr. Each isochrone spans a wide range in luminosity, from MV~14 up to the tip of the red giant branch. These are complemented by a set of He-burning tracks that extend from the zero-age horizontal branch to the onset of thermal pulsations on the asymptotic giant branch. In addition, a set of computer programs are provided that make it possible to interpolate the isochrones in [Fe/H], generate luminosity functions from the isochrones, and create synthetic horizontal-branch models. The tracks and isochrones have been converted to the observational plane with two different color-Teff transformations, one synthetic and one semiempirical, in ground-based B, V, and I, and F606W and F814W for both ACS WFC and WFPC2 systems. All models and programs presented in this paper are available at the Dartmouth Stellar Evolution Database and the Multimission Archive at the Space Telescope Science Institute.

	Abstract = {Globular cluster (GC) systems have now been studied in galaxies ranging from dwarfs to giants and spanning the full Hubble sequence of morphological types. Imaging and spectroscopy with the Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based telescopes have together established that most galaxies have bimodal color distributions that reflect two subpopulations of old GCs: metal-poor and metal-rich. The characteristics of both subpopulations are correlated with those of their parent galaxies. We argue that metal-poor GCs formed in low-mass dark matter halos in the early universe and that their properties reflect biased galaxy assembly. The metal-rich GCs were born in the subsequent dissipational buildup of their parent galaxies and their ages and abundances indicate that most massive early-type galaxies formed the bulk of their stars at early times. Detailed studies of both subpopulations offer some of the strongest constraints on hierarchical galaxy formation that can be obtained in the near-field.},

A model is chosen that provides an excellent fit to the metallicity distribution of stars in the Geneva-Copenhagen survey (GCS) of the solar neighbourhood, and a good fit to the local Hess diagram. The model provides a good fit to the distribution of GCS stars in the age-metallicity plane although this plane was not used in the fitting process. Although this model's star-formation rate is monotonic declining, its disc naturally splits into an alpha-enhanced thick disc and a normal thin disc. In particular the model's distribution of stars in the ([O/Fe],[Fe/H]) plane resembles that of Galactic stars in displaying a ridge line for each disc. The thin-disc's ridge line is entirely due to stellar migration and there is the characteristic variation of stellar angular momentum along it that has been noted by Haywood in survey data. Radial mixing of stellar populations with high sigma_z from inner regions of the disc to the solar neighbourhood provides a natural explanation of why measurements yield a steeper increase of sigma_z with age than predicted by theory. The metallicity gradient in the ISM is predicted to be steeper than in earlier models, but appears to be in good agreement with data for both our Galaxy and external galaxies. The models are inconsistent with a cutoff in the star-formation rate at low gas surface densities. The absolute magnitude of the disc is given as a function of time in several photometric bands, and radial colour profiles are plotted for representative times.},

We present details about the selection criteria, which were based both on morphological and photometrical features. The extracted sample of stellar clusters shows the presence of two cluster populations, a blue cluster group (young) with 560 objects, and a red cluster group (old) with 120 objects. The young group lacks clusters more massive than 10000 solar masses, that are present in large numbers in its neighbor M82. The luminosity distribution function of the young group follows a power-law distribution with an index of 2.0, whereas that for the red group resembles very much the globular cluster luminosity function in the Milky Way. Assuming an age of 5 Gyr, these red clusters have masses between 0.1 to 10 million solar masses.},

Equatorial coordinates, integrated magnitudes and angular sizes are listed for all 115 objects. Eight clusters have sufficiently red colors to be candidates for old globulars. For four clusters we extracted resolved stellar photometry. Object 33-3-018 located in the outer disk of M33 turned out to be a young cluster with an age estimated at 200-350 Myr. Cluster ZK-90 has an age of 3-5 Gyr. The remaining two clusters have intermediate ages ranging from one to a few Gyr.},

In particular, they have tested size-of-sample effects through the analysis of Monte Carlo simulations of LFs drawn from an assumed universal population like that characterizing the globular clusters in the Local Group. The authors have also considered the effects of the field objects that will contaminate real cluster LFs in remote galaxies and have tested for biases and the attainable precision in derived distances as a function of limiting magnitude (relative to the turnover in the luminosity function). The findings are that maximum-likelihood methods are very robust. Globular clusters are more far-reaching distance indicators than has previously been realized. The authors apply the maximum-likelihood methods to available data and comment upon the implications of the results and the future promise of the method.},

	Abstract = {We present an axisymmetric, equilibrium model for late-type galaxies which consists of an exponential disk, a S{\'e}rsic bulge, and a cuspy dark halo. The model is specified by a phase-space distribution function which, in turn, depends on the integrals of motion. Bayesian statistics and the Markov chain Monte Carlo method are used to tailor the model to satisfy observational data and theoretical constraints. By way of example, we construct a chain of 105 models for the Milky Way designed to fit a wide range of photometric and kinematic observations. From this chain, we calculate the probability distribution function of important Galactic parameters such as the S{\'e}rsic index of the bulge, the disk scale length, and the disk, bulge, and halo masses. We also calculate the probability distribution function of the local dark matter velocity dispersion and density, two quantities of paramount significance for terrestrial dark matter detection experiments. Although the Milky Way models in our chain all satisfy the prescribed observational constraints, they vary considerably in key structural parameters and therefore respond differently to nonaxisymmetric perturbations. We simulate the evolution of 25 models which have different Toomre Q and Goldreich-Tremaine X parameters. Virtually all of these models form a bar, although some more quickly than others. The bar pattern speeds are ~40-50 km s-1 kpc-1 at the time when they form and then decrease, presumably due to coupling of the bar with the halo. Since the Galactic bar has a pattern speed ~50 km s-1 kpc-1, we conclude that it must have formed recently.},

The models are chosen from a set first constructed by Kuijken & Dubinski. We develop an algorithm to search the parameter space for this set in order to best match observations of the M31 rotation curve, inner velocity dispersion profile, and surface brightness profile. Models are obtained for a large range of bulge and disk masses; we find that the disk mass must be <~8×1010 Msolar and that the preferred value for the bulge mass is 2.5×1010 Msolar. N-body simulations are carried out to test the stability of our models against the formation of a bar within the disk. We also calculate the baryon fraction and halo concentration parameter for a subset of our models and show that the results are consistent with the predictions from cosmological theories of structure formation. In addition, we describe how gravitational microlensing surveys and dynamical studies of globular clusters and satellites can further constrain the models.},

This is a new and simple way to estimate the enclosed mass from the projected positions and line-of-sight velocities of a tracer population (such as globular clusters, halo stars, and planetary nebulae). Like the projected mass estimator, it works by averaging (projecteddistance)(radialvelocity)2/G over the sample. However, it applies to the commonest case of all, in which the tracer population does not follow the overall dark matter density. The method is verified against simulated data sets drawn from Monte Carlo realizations of exact solutions of the collisionless Boltzmann equation and applied to the M31 globular cluster data set of Perrett and coworkers, as well as to M31's satellite galaxies.},

	Abstract = {This paper argues that the Milky Way galaxy is probably the largest member of the Local Group. The evidence comes from estimates of the total mass of the Andromeda galaxy (M31) derived from the three-dimensional positions and radial velocities of its satellite galaxies, as well as the projected positions and radial velocities of its distant globular clusters and planetary nebulae. The available data set comprises 10 satellite galaxies, 17 distant globular clusters and nine halo planetary nebulae with radial velocities. We find that the halo of Andromeda has a mass of ~ 12.3+18-6 x 1011 Msun, together with a scalelength of ~90kpc and a predominantly isotropic velocity distribution. For comparison, our earlier estimate for the Milky Way halo is 19+36-17 x 1011 Msun. Although the error bars are admittedly large, this suggests that the total mass of M31 is probably less than that of the Milky Way. We verify the robustness of our results to changes in the modelling assumptions and to errors caused by the small size and incompleteness of the data set. Our surprising claim can be checked in several ways in the near future. The numbers of satellite galaxies, planetary nebulae and globular clusters with radial velocities can be increased by ground-based spectroscopy, while the proper motions of the companion galaxies and the unresolved cores of the globular clusters can be measured using the astrometric satellites Space Interferometry Mission (SIM) and Global Astrometric Interferometer for Astrophysics (GAIA). Using 100 globular clusters at projected radii 20<~R<~50kpc with both radial velocities and proper motions, it will be possible to estimate the mass within 50kpc to an accuracy of ~20per cent. Measuring the proper motions of the companion galaxies with SIM and GAIA will reduce the uncertainty in the total mass caused by the small size of the data set to ~22per cent.},

Changes with redshift in the observed properties of field galaxies are directly related to the evolution of the disks and of the stellar populations. We see that changes in the rest-frame luminosity of a galaxy induce smaller values of half-light radii than are predicted assuming no evolution. Comparisons are presented with two observed samples from Mutz et al. and Smail et al.},

	Abstract = {We use the Hubble Ultra Deep Field to study the galaxy luminosity-size (M-Re) distribution. With a careful analysis of selection effects due to both detection completeness and measurement reliability, we identify bias-free regions in the M-Re plane for a series of volume-limited samples. By comparison to a nearby survey also having well-defined selection limits, namely the Millennium Galaxy Catalogue, we present clear evidence for evolution in surface brightness since z ~ 0.7. Specifically, we demonstrate that the mean, rest-frame B-band <μ>e for galaxies in a sample spanning 8 mag in luminosity between MB = -22 and -14 mag increases by ~1.0 mag arcsec-2 from z ~ 0.1 to 0.7. We also highlight the importance of considering surface brightness-dependent measurement biases in addition to incompleteness biases. In particular, the increasing, systematic underestimation of Kron fluxes towards low surface brightnesses may cause diffuse, yet luminous, systems to be mistaken for faint, compact objects.},

	Abstract = {The paper discusses disk galaxies formed from collapsing gas in extended haloes of dark material. It was assumed that these systems were produced by hierarchical clustering and have angular moments from tidal torques. Models were developed to determine the structure of the haloes in terms of observable properties of the disks. It was shown that: (1) collapse factors of 10 or more and halo-to-disk mass ratios of 5 or more are necessary to explain the rapid rotation of the disks; (2) the halo rotation curves computed on the basis of detailed conservation of angular momentum in the disks are flat, and (3) most disks are globally unstable to the formation of non-axisymmetric perturbations unless their mass-to-light ratios are much smaller than current estimates.},

	Abstract = {We develop an idealized inside-out formation model for disk galaxies to include a realistic mix of galaxy types and luminosities that provides a fair match to the traditional observables. The predictions of our infall models are compared against identical models with no-size evolution by generating fully realistic simulations of the Hubble Deep Field, from which we recover the angular size distributions. We find that our infall models produce angular size distributions that are nearly identical to those of our no-size evolution models in the case of a Omega =0 geometry but produce slightly smaller sizes in the case of a Omega =1 geometry, a difference we associate with the different amounts of cosmic time in our two models for evolving to relatively low redshifts ( z~1--2 ). Our infall models also predict a slightly smaller (11%--29%) number of large (disk scale lengths greater than 4 h^{-1}50 kpc) galaxies at z~0.7 for the Canada France Redshift Survey, as well as different increases in the central surface brightness of the disks for early-type spirals, the infall model predicting an increase by 1.2 mag out to z~2( Omega =0) and z~1( Omega =1) , while our no-size evolution models predict an increase of only 0.5 mag. This result suggests that infall models could be important for explaining the 1.2--1.6 mag increase in surface brightness reported by Schade and coworkers.},

	Abstract = {The Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) Nearby Galaxy Survey Treasury is a large Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/ACS treasury program to obtain resolved stellar photometry for a volume-limited sample of galaxies out to 4 Mpc. As part of this program, we have obtained deep ACS imaging of a field in the outer disk of the large spiral galaxy M81. The field contains the outskirts of a spiral arm as well as an area containing no current star formation. Our imaging results in a color-magnitude diagram (CMD) reaching to m F814W = 28.8 and m F606W = 29.5, one magnitude fainter than the red clump. Through detailed modeling of the full CMD, we quantify the age and metallicity distribution of the stellar populations contained in the field. The mean metallicity in the field is --1 < [M/H] < 0 and only a small fraction of stars have ages lsim 1 Gyr. The results show that most of the stars in this outer disk field were formed by z ~ 1 and that the arm structure at this radius has a lifetime of gsim 100 Myr. We discuss the measured evolution of the M81 disk in the context of surveys of high redshift disk galaxies and deep stellar photometry of other nearby galaxies. All of these indicate that massive spiral disks are mostly formed by z ~ 1 and that they have experienced rapid metal enrichment.},

	Abstract = {A comprehensive study of the measurement of star formation histories from colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) is presented, with an emphasis on a variety of subtle issues involved in the generation of model CMDs and maximum likelihood solution. Among these are the need for a complete sampling of the synthetic CMD, the use of proper statistics for dealing with Poisson-distributed data (and a demonstration of why χ 2 must not be used), measuring full uncertainties in all reported parameters, quantifying the goodness-of-fit, and questions of binning the CMD and incorporating outside information. Several example star formation history measurements are given. Two examples involve synthetic data, in which the input and recovered parameters can be compared to locate possible flaws in the methodology (none were apparent) and measure the accuracy with which ages, metallicities and star formation rates can be recovered. Solutions of the histories of seven Galactic dwarf spheroidal companions (Carina, Draco, Leo I, Leo II, Sagittarius, Sculptor and Ursa Minor) illustrate the ability to measure star formation histories given a variety of conditions - numbers of stars, complexity of star formation history and amount of foreground contamination. Significant measurements of ancient >8Gyr star formation are made in all seven galaxies. Sculptor, Draco and Ursa Minor appear entirely ancient, while the other systems show varying amounts of younger stars.},

	Abstract = {Previously calculated models of the collapse of protogalaxies with rotational and axial symmetry are extended to galaxies characterized by both a spheroidal component and a disk component containing a substantial fraction of the total mass. The predicted disk-to-bulge ratio is found to depend mainly on the assumed rate of star formation and its time variation. It is shown that formation of the spheroidal component requires an early stage of rapid star formation, while formation of the disk requires a later stage of much slower star formation to allow the residual gas to settle into the disk before forming stars. The calculations suggest that the slow phase of star formation may involve relatively diffuse gas, the rapid phase may involve strongly clumped gas, and the degree of clumping may depend on the intensity of the turbulence or collisions within the gas. The models also predict stellar metallicity distributions and kinematic properties that are in qualitative agreement with those of the stellar populations in the Milky Way and other spirals, as well as a long time scale for the formation of the outer regions of the disk.},

@article{MacArthur:2004,
	Abstract = {We investigate optical and near-IR color gradients in a sample of 172 low-inclination galaxies spanning Hubble types S0-Irr. The colors are compared with stellar population synthesis models from which luminosity-weighted average ages and metallicities are determined. We explore the effects of different underlying star formation histories and additional bursts of star formation. Our results are robust in a relative sense under the assumption that our galaxies shared a similar underlying star formation history and that no bursts involving more than ~10% of the galaxy mass have occurred in the past 1-2 Gyr. Because the observed gradients show radial structure, we measure ``inner'' and ``outer'' disk age and metallicity gradients. Trends in age and metallicity and their gradients are explored as a function of Hubble type, rotational velocity, total near-IR galaxy magnitude, central surface brightness, and scale length. We find strong correlations in age and metallicity with Hubble type, rotational velocity, total magnitude, and central surface brightness in the sense that earlier-type, faster rotating, more luminous, and higher surface brightness galaxies are older and more metal-rich, suggesting an early and more rapid star formation history for these galaxies. The increasing trends with rotational velocity and total magnitude level off for Vrot>~120kms-1 and MK<~-23 mag, respectively. This effect is stronger for metallicity (than age), which could reflect a threshold potential above which all metals are retained and thus metallicity saturates at the yield. Outer disk gradients are found to be weaker than the inner gradients as expected for a slower variation of the potential and surface brightness in the outer parts. We find that stronger age gradients are associated with weaker metallicity gradients. Trends in gradients with galaxy parameters are compared with model predictions: these trends do not agree with predictions of semianalytic models of hierarchical galaxy formation, possibly owing to the effect of bar-induced radial flows. The observed trends are in agreement with chemo-spectrophotometric models of spiral galaxy evolution based on CDM-motivated scaling laws but none of the hierarchical merging characteristics, implying a strong dependence of the star formation history of spiral galaxies on the galaxy potential and halo spin parameter.},

	Abstract = {All galaxies are thought to reside within large haloes of dark matter, whose properties can only be determined from indirect observations. The formation and assembly of galaxies is determined from the interplay between these dark matter haloes and the baryonic matter they host. Although statistical relations can be used to approximate how massive a galaxy's halo is, very few individual galaxies have direct measurements of their halo masses. We present a method to directly estimate the total mass of a galaxy's dark halo using its system of globular clusters. The link between globular cluster systems and halo masses is independent of a galaxy's type and environment, in contrast to the relationship between galaxy halo and stellar masses. This trend is expected in models where globular clusters form in early, rare density peaks in the cold dark matter density field and the epoch of reionization was roughly coeval throughout the Universe. We illustrate the general utility of this relation by demonstrating that a galaxy's supermassive black hole mass and global X-ray luminosity are directly proportional to their host dark halo masses, as inferred from our new method.},

	Abstract = {We present resolved stellar photometry of 4 fields along the major axis of the M33 disk from images taken with the Advanced Camera for Surveys aboard the Hubble Space Telescope. The photometry provides a detailed census of the red clump in all fields and reaches the ancient main sequence in the outermost field. Through detailed modeling of the color-magnitude diagrams, we find that the percentage of the stellar mass formed prior to z=1 changes from 71 +/- 9% in the innermost field to 16 +/- 6% in the outermost field. The disk shows a clear trend of increasing scale-length with time, evolving from 1.0 +/- 0.1 kpc 10 Gyr ago to 1.8 +/- 0.1 kpc at times more recent than 5 Gyr ago, in agreement with analytical predictions for disk growth. Beyond the disk truncation radius, however, the stellar density profile steepens with time and the age gradient reverses, in agreement with recent simulations. The late and slow growth of the stellar disk may be due in part to the low mass of M33.},

	Abstract = {We present Keck/HIRES spectra of 3 globular clusters in the outer halo of M31, at projected distances beyond ~80 kpc from M31. The measured recession velocities for all 3 globular clusters confirm their association with the globular cluster system of M31. We find evidence for a declining velocity dispersion with radius for the globular cluster system. Their measured internal velocity dispersions, derived virial masses and mass-to-light ratios are consistent with those for the bulk of the M31 globular cluster system. We derive old ages and metallicities which indicate that all 3 belong to the metal-poor halo globular cluster subpopulation. We find indications that the radial gradient of the mean metallicity of the globular cluster system interior to 50 kpc flattens in the outer regions, however it is still more metal-poor than the corresponding field stars at the same (projected) radius. },

	Abstract = {We have constrained the age of the globular cluster S312 in the Andromeda galaxy (M31) by comparing its multicolor photometry with theoretical stellar population synthesis models. This is both a check on the age of this globular cluster and a check on our methodology. Main-sequence photometry has been the most direct method for determining the age of a star cluster. S312 was observed as part of the Beijing-Arizona-Taiwan-Connecticut (BATC) Multicolor Sky Survey from 1995 February to 2003 December. The photometry of BATC images for S312 was taken with nine intermediate-band filters covering 5000-10000 {\AA}. Combined with photometry in the near-ultraviolet (NUV) of GALEX, broadband UBVR, and infrared JHKs of 2MASS, we obtained the accurate spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of S312 from 2267-20000 {\AA}. A quantitative comparison to simple stellar population models yields an age of 9.5+1.15-0.99 Gyr, which is in very good agreement with the previous determination by main-sequence photometry. S312 has a mass of 9.8+/-1.85×105 Msolar and is a medium-mass globular cluster in M31. By analyzing the errors of ages determined based on the SED-fitting method of this paper, secure age constraints are derived with errors of <3 Gyr for ages younger than 9 Gyr. In fact, the theoretical SEDs are not sensitive to the variation of age for ages > ~10 Gyr. Therefore, our method does not accurately distinguish globular clusters (GCs) as old as the majority of the Galactic GCs. We emphasize that our results show that even with multiband photometry spanning from NUV to Ks, our age constraints from SED fitting are distressingly uncertain, which has implications for age derivations in extragalactic globular cluster systems. },

	Abstract = {The structures of globular clusters (GCs) reflect their dynamical states and past histories. High-resolution imaging allows the exploration of morphologies of clusters in other galaxies. Surface brightness profiles from new Hubble Space Telescope observations of 34 GCs in M31 are presented, together with fits of several different structural models to each cluster. M31 clusters appear to be adequately fit by standard King models and do not obviously require alternate descriptions with relatively stronger halos, such as are needed to fit many GCs in other nearby galaxies. The derived structural parameters are combined with corrected versions of those measured in an earlier survey in order to construct a comprehensive catalog of structural and dynamical parameters for M31 GCs with a sample size similar to that for the Milky Way. Clusters in M31, the Milky Way, Magellanic Clouds, the Fornax dwarf spheroidal, and NGC 5128 define a very tight fundamental plane with identical slopes. The combined evidence for these widely different galaxies strongly reinforces the view that old GCs have near-universal structural properties, regardless of host environment.

Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555. These observations are associated with programs 8664, 9719, 9767, and 10260. },

	Abstract = {Aims.We present the first results of a large spectroscopic survey of globular clusters and candidate globular clusters in the nearby M 31 galaxy. The survey is aimed at the classification of known candidate M 31 clusters and at the study of their kinematic properties.
Methods: .We obtained low-resolution spectroscopy (λ/Δλ ≃ 800-1300) for 133 targets, including 76 yet-to-be-confirmed candidate clusters (i.e. with no previous spectroscopic information), 55 already-confirmed genuine M 31 clusters, and 2 uncertain candidates. Our observations allowed a reliable estimate of the target radial velocity, within a typical accuracy of ~$\pm$ 20 km s-1. The observed candidates have been robustly classified according to their radial velocity and shape parameters that allowed us to confidently discriminate between point sources and extended objects even from low-spatial-resolution imagery.
Results: .In our set of 76 candidate clusters we found: 42 newly-confirmed bona-fide M 31 clusters, 12 background galaxies, 17 foreground Galactic stars, 2 Hii regions belonging to M 31 and 3 unclassified (possibly M 31 clusters or foreground stars) objects. The classification of a few other candidates not included in our survey has been also reassessed on various observational bases. All the sources of radial velocity estimates for M 31 known globular clusters available in the literature have been compared and checked, and a homogeneous general list has been obtained for 349 confirmed clusters with radial velocity.
Conclusions: .Our results suggest that a significant number of genuine clusters (≳100) is still hidden among the plethora of known candidates proposed by various authors. Hence our knowledge of the globular cluster system of the M 31 galaxy is still far from complete even in terms of simple membership. },

@article{Galleti:2007,
	Abstract = {Aims.We present the first results of a large spectroscopic survey of candidate globular clusters located in the extreme outskirts of the nearby M 31 galaxy. The survey is aimed at ascertaining the nature of the selected candidates to increase the sample of confirmed M 31 clusters lying more that 2$\,^{\circ}$ away from the center of the galaxy. Methods: We obtained low resolution spectra (λ/Δλ ≃ 800-1300) of 48 targets selected from the Extended Source Catalogue of 2MASS, as in Galleti et al. (2005, A&A, 436, 535). The observed candidates have been robustly classified according to their radial velocity and by verifying their extended/point-source nature from ground-based optical images. We have also obtained a spectrum and a radial velocity estimate for the remote M 31 globular discovered by Martin et al. (2006b, MNRAS, 371, 1983). Results: Among the 48 observed candidates clusters we found: 35 background galaxies, 8 foreground Galactic stars, and 5 genuine remote globular clusters. One of them has been already identified independently by Mackey et al. (2007, ApJ, 655, L85), their GC1; the other four are completely new discoveries: B516, B517, B518, B519. The newly discovered clusters lie at projected distance 40 kpc ≲ R_p≲ 100 kpc from the center of M 31, and have absolute integrated magnitude -9.5 ≲ MV ≲ -7.5. For all the observed clusters we have measured the strongest Lick indices and we have obtained spectroscopic metallicity estimates. Mackey-GC1, Martin-GC1, B517 and B518 have spectra typical of old and metal poor globular clusters ([Fe/H] ≲ -1.3); B519 appears old but quite metal-rich ([Fe/H]~≃ -0.5); B516 presents very strong Balmer absorption lines: if this is indeed a cluster it should have a relatively young age (likely < 2 Gyr). Conclusions: The present analysis nearly doubles the number of M 31 globulars at R_p≥ 40 kpc. At odds with the Milky Way, M 31 appears to have a significant population of very bright globular clusters in its extreme outskirts.

We have searched for GCs on CCD images taken with Washington CMT1 filters at the KPNO 0.9 m telescope using the following steps: (1) inspection of morphological parameters given by the SExtractor package such as stellarity, full width at half-maximum, and ellipticity; (2) consulting the spectral types and radial velocities obtained from spectra taken with the Hydra spectrograph at the WIYN 3.5 m telescope; and (3) visual inspection of the images of each object. We have found 1164 GCs and GC candidates, of which 605 are newly found GCs and GC candidates and 559 are previously known GCs. Among the new objects there are 113 genuine GCs, 258 probable GCs, and 234 possible GCs, according to our classification criteria. Among the known objects there are 383 genuine GCs, 109 probable GCs, and 67 possible GCs. In total there are 496 genuine GCs, 367 probable GCs, and 301 possible GCs.

	Abstract = {We report the discovery of 40 new globular clusters (GCs) that have been found in surveys of the halo of M31 based on the Isaac Newton Telescope/Wide-Field Camera and Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope/Megacam imagery. A subset of these new GCs are of an extended, diffuse nature and include those already found in Huxor et al. The search strategy is described and basic positional and V and I photometric data are presented for each cluster. For a subset of these clusters, K-band photometry is also given. The new clusters continue to be found to the limit of the survey area (~100 kpc), revealing that the GC system of M31 is much more extended than previously realized. The new clusters increase the total number of confirmed GCs in M31 by approximately 10 per cent and the number of confirmed GCs beyond 1&deg; (~14 kpc) by more than 75 per cent. We have also used the survey imagery as well recent Hubble Space Telescope archival data to update the Revised Bologna Catalogue of M31 globular clusters. },
